[[ CHAPTER 1: Between a Rox and a Hard Place ]]

>Whimsey World
>Quickly approaching the #1 all-inclusive vacation destination
>It’s becoming so popular that seasonal workers in the resorts and theme parks are in high demand
>That’s where an Anon like you comes in
>You’ve been hired as a seasonal employee for the first half of the year
>Specifically, you’re one of the mascot “handlers”
>It’s your job to make sure the employees in the costumes don’t get harassed by all the demon children and their short-tempered parents
>It’s not as physically intensive as you’d expect, but it’s highly draining on your mental fortitude
>Poor Rox has it worse, being the one in the costume
>Most days you’re partnered with her, and the two of you have become like war buddies at this point
>You’ve fought it all: Holidays, hurricanes, vomit, Brazilian tour groups...
>Truthfully, you’re not sure where the tour groups are from most of the time
>But like Rox says, “There’s always a ‘Brazilian’ of them.”
>In a short amount of time you’ve learned practically all of her jokes and quirks
>You pretty much need to know her inside and out in order to protect her from threats before they happen
>She ends up patting you on the back or the head far more often than she does the guests as a show of gratitude
>She’s gotta stay in character, after all, which means she can’t speak much when outside
>When she does speak, it’s a rough sort of female voice
>The kind you’d imagine coming from a snarky tomboy
>Except you’ve honestly never actually seen her face before
>Mascots come out to meet their handlers fully dressed, and exit to their own “backstage” rooms
>You have to admit there’s a certain thrill behind not knowing what your partner looks like, but your curiosity still beats out leaving it a mystery
>All you know is she’s gotta be a taller girl, since costumes are assigned based on wearer height and build rather than preference or sex
>Like tonight she’s “Whirly Barf”, a large beagle with his food-covered tongue constantly whipping all over the place
>Every time she turns she makes sure to slap you in the face with the tongue
>It’s a riot for the guests, not so much you
>But you’re a good sport about it
>She’s the closest friend you have here, even if you only know her as an enigma inside a character suit
>It tears you up a bit inside to know your season is ending in a few weeks
>Unless by some miracle you get an extension or a permanent position
>You resolve to make the most of what time you have left with Rox, though
>The park is open extra late for select visitors this evening, but there’s hardly any turnout for a variety of reasons
>The two of you are just about to call it a day when Rox leans in close
>”Hey, Anon. I really, really, REALLY need a drink tonight. You up?”
>Is tonight the big one?
>Are you finally going to get to see the girl under the mask?
>You’re definitely not going to miss this opportunity
>”Great. Let’s hit the locker room first.”
>...Wait, together?
>”I won’t tell if you won’t,” she whispers, as though anyone else is going to hear her through that clumsy mask. “I’m not putting up with Costuming’s shit tonight. Just gonna peel it off and toss it in the bin.”
>You’re going to get to see Rox’s face AND her body?
>This is going to be a summer for the books

>Underneath Whimsey Park is a small city of tunnels for the employees to travel through
>Dodge the crowds, take your lunch break, get your outfit and your attitude ready...
>Everything’s segregated by attraction and job role, so you never get to see where all the mascots prepare themselves
>It’s equal parts exciting and worrisome
>You don’t have nearly the right kind of clearance to be here on your own, but Rox has your back
>Especially as you approach the women’s locker rooms
>She ducks in to check if the coast’s clear, then beckons you inside
>You’re fine waiting for her, but she’s not having any of it
>”I need someone to keep me from chucking this thing at the next person who walks in,” she says, thumping her mask, “So, do you want to be an accessory to murder, or are you coming in?”
>You may know all her jokes, but you also know when she ISN’T joking
>She points you to the discreet clasp on her neck and you unbuckle her
>Here it is, the moment of truth
>You flip through the last-minute theories of what kind of girl she could be
>What ethnicity?
>What color eyes?
>What species?
>...
>What
>...
>A...wolf!?
>When the dog mask comes off, there’s still a canine underneath
>Dark gray fur with a lighter underbelly, brown splotches on her face and muzzle, luminescent gold eyes
>A literal wolf
>A wolfess, to be precise
>And just like that, she continues stripping off the Whirly Barf
>She doesn’t look like she was expecting you to react at all
>She’s already half undressed by the time you blink again, and soon the whole costume is on the floor
>Rox is just in a creamy bra and panties at this point
>Her body is toned, though her womanly curves still manage to show even through all the muscle and fur
>Her pelt is matted from the costume and cooling packs, making it look like she was somehow sweating
>”God...damn am I a mess. No time to shower. Gotta meet the others.”
>There are others?
>The wolfess throws on a tight t-shirt and bounces into some jeans, tail swishing around like it’s trying not to be contained
>She ruffles her disheveled fur to make it even wilder, and then collects her costume pieces
>”Ready? Let’s go.”
>But...
>Wolves...
>She’s already out the door, and you’re sure as hell not going to stick around to be found in the girl’s lockers all alone
>Although you stop to wonder if there ARE other animals working here...
>”ANON! Get the lead out!”
>She takes you to a set of locked doors and flashes a keycard at them
>Now you’re even deeper into territory where you don’t belong
>Rox literally tosses her costume into a passing bin and you’re pulled outside
>It’s the employee parking, but in a part of the park you didn’t even realize existed
>”Right over here, I’ll drive.”
>Well, it’s a human car: a beat up, nondescript sedan
>You’re coaxed into the passenger seat, and the wolfess flops into the driver side
>You’re never given any chance to initiate one of your dozen burning questions as she speeds off to the outskirts of the resort
>The whole place is a city in of itself, but everything outside of it flourishes with Whimsey World’s secondhand tourism
>And yet even the employees want to stay close to the park grounds, considering it has pretty much any amenity anyone could ask for
>Rox just keeps casually talking about the day as though nothing is out of the ordinary
>”Holy shit were those autograph lines bad today. ‘Least I got to write over that stuck-up bitch’s sickening little princess penmanship by ‘accident’. By the way, thanks for pulling those triplets off me. I’ll let you use my discount if you want to get some better lunch tomorrow instead of that vending machine crap.”
>You can only make grunts and quick one-word responses with how quickly she carries over to the next subject
>If you didn’t know any better (and you obviously don’t, given how oblivious you’ve been to all this), you’d say she’s trying to stall you
>But she’s still the Rox you thought you knew, right?
>She may have her odd moments, but you don’t think she would consciously try to do you harm
>Right?

>Soon you’re parking around the back of a pretty popular bar, with the entrance gates of Whimsey World not too far off in the distance
>The Booze Cruise
>There’s not much alcohol in the resort, so you have to escape for a while to get drunk
>It’s a place you’ve hung out with your coworkers many times, but never your truest partner
>So it’s always humans, and never an anthropomorphic wolf girl
>It’s at this time that the wolfess finally acknowledges the situation
>”Alright, keep close to me and don’t say anything yet. I have a bet to win.”
>Once again, you’re traveling through the hidden part of a building you thought you knew pretty well
>Up the stairs you go, and soon you’re gazing at a window overlooking the regular bar level below
>You’re up in a section that’s divided from the rest of the place by a one-way mirror
>You always assumed it was just a regular mirror when you’ve looked up from the other side
>Not something to protect all these animal people from the “regular” human patrons
>Yes, there are many more animals
>And now they’re all looking at you
>”Roxie!?” a female oriole at the closest table gasps
>Rox wraps an arm around your shoulder and steers you up to the bird
>”Anon, this is my roommate, Chee. Chee, this—“
>”What are you DOING?” The bird screams. “A human!?”
>”Inside voices, Chee. What I’m DOING is winning a bet. Brought him here without a single scream, broken bone, or witness. Where’s my fucking drink?”
>”That was a JOKE, Roxie! You did this for a free DRINK?”
>The onlookers are just as speechless as you are
>Mammals, birds, a few reptiles...
>Anything you can think of
>Rox ignores them all
>She struts up to the counter where a panda bartender has his jaw wide open
>”Two of the usual, Cookie. I’m guessing Chee has a tab open, yeah?”
>”ROKSA!”
>Ohh, this won’t be good
>A tigress wearing what you know all too well as the pinstripe uniform of a park coordinator approaches
>Unbuttoned, but still a symbol of authority
>”Off the clock but not off their high horse”, as the saying goes regarding coordinators
>[Sherry-K], the immaculate name badge reads
>”Hey, Sher,” Rox replies with a sip of her drink
>The roam on the tip of her black snout looks kind of cute
>”Nobody needs to say anything before trying to do something stupid, I guess!” the tigress sputters.
>You can almost visualize a clipboard in her paws if she were at her job like the rest of the coordinators
>Though it’s even more intimidating when it’s an apex predator
>“I hope what you’re doing is clearly not your idea of a two-week’s notice!” the tigress continues
>”Nope, just taking some initiative,” the wolfess shrugs. “I overheard the whole, ‘Let’s consider mixing human workers with anthros and test the waters’ plan after the last company meeting, and I figured I’d do a trial run myself. Anon seems to be holding up quite well, huh?”
>She gives you a strong slap on the back, sending a splatter of alcohol near the tigress’ feet
>Rox may be the closest friend you have in the theme park
>But your job AND all these other “anthros” against her little stunt?
>Someone’s definitely not leaving this bar alive
>Unfortunately, that seems to be Rox’s idea, albeit in ultimatum form
>”So, now he knows. Can’t change that at this point. We can either get a head start on that ‘coexisting’ thing, or you’re going to have to get rid of the poor guy.”
>”Don’t give me that choice,” Sherry-K seethes with a venomous grin. “You know full well which one I’d go with.”
>If Whimsey World can hide an entire organization of anthros in their park, you’re sure they could make a single human disappear if they needed to
>”Well I already won one bet tonight, so I’m feeling lucky,” the wolfess says cooly
>The two anthro ladies are up in each other’s face
>The symmetrical docking of their furry breasts would be arousing if you weren’t fearing for your life
>”If management finds out and doesn’t like it, I’LL take the blame,” Rox says. “But, if you convince them to go with it, I’ll let YOU take the credit for the idea. Deal?”
>Sherry-K furrows her brow
>”I’m not taking your ridiculous bet, Roksa.”
>”It’s not a bet if you have nothing to lose,” Rox counters
>The tigress growls
>The wolfess just slams her hand on the counter
>”How about a drink to loosen up? Chee’s buying.”
>There’s tension in the bar, but enough alcohol will ease just about anything
>You already know almost half of the patrons here, considering you’ve been their mascot handler one time or another
>Some are genuinely relieved you know their “secret”, while others are more apprehensive
>Only Sherry-K seems to have major resentment, but it’s more at Rox’s expense than yours
>However, even being (mostly) innocent in this isn’t much of an excuse
>Wolf and tiger have some heated talks just outside of your earshot
>”Yours”, because it’s not hard to believe the rest of the anthros here are fully aware of what’s being said
>The feline coordinator eventually confronts you
>”Until we have this all sorted out, we’re going to have to keep you under OUR team’s watch. That means staying within park grounds, and I’m going to have to make sure you’re ALWAYS with one of us at all times.”
>There’s that clipboard authority again, but also the tone of someone sick of shenanigans on a more personal level
>”I can’t trust Roksa one freaking minute it seems, but at least Chee is responsible enough to stay with.”
>Chee has a pitiful “Why me?” look on her face
>You kind of feel bad for her
>The two of you have been roped into something so suddenly, but you have a greater chance of ruining her life than vice versa
>”Responsible AND a fine DD,” Rox laughs. “Ready to go?”
>The bird sighs and grabs her keys
>You, her, and the wolfess all pile into Chee’s car, with you in the back seat
>”You know I’ll make this up to you, right?” Rox says to her roommate as they buckle in, punching her lightly on he shoulder
>”Yeah, I know, but....”
>The bird’s feathers waver nervously over the steering wheel
>”Can you promise to at least keep it down when you...you know, go to bed?”
>Even in the rear-view mirror you can see the wolfess’ eyes go wide
>”W-what? Me and...? Chee!”
>Yup, a summer for the books



[[ CHAPTER 2: Pile of Rox ]]

>Within the boundaries of Whimsey World is employee housing
>It’s a cheap place to board temps and seasonal workers, like you
>But hidden away from the bright, cheerful roads and sky-scraping hotels is the anthro housing
>Obviously constructed to keep them out of trouble as much as possible
>You’re starting to realize why Rox would never accept your offer to come over when you worked up the courage to ask her
>At first you thought she was making up excuses and putting on a fake tone of disappointment just to get out of it
>But now it seems like she genuinely felt bad not being able to tell you sooner
>So now all bets are off, and in a few short hours you’ve been dragged into something far larger than either of you
>Chee steers her car into a shadowy part of the parking lot outside of the anthro housing
>Pretty much just like regular apartments from the outside
>Probably to throw off anyone who might be sneaking around or flying overhead
>The bird sighs as she takes her keys out
>”I guess now I’m going to have to drive you back to the bar for YOUR car, too.”
>”It’s not going anywhere,” Rox says, waving her off
>”Then how are you getting to work tomorrow?”
>The wolfess frowns, then grins sheepishly
>”You’re something else,” Chee says
>The two girls keep you concealed between them as you head up to their place
>There’s the muffled sound of music coming from the adjacent apartments, and a few have cheesy doormats outside
>It’s all very similar to how humans would treat apartments, and it would never make you think anthros were living here until one of them would open their door
>The same goes for the inside of the girls’ place
>Everything is decorated just like you’d expect from a pair of bachelorettes
>Not that you’d know from experience
>The furniture is pretty cheap and mismatched, and it looks like their entire budget for luxuries went to nice TVs and music systems
>And a LOT of Whimsey World memorabilia
>Chee picks up on your observation
>”It’s all from employee discounts, heh...” she mumbles
>”Don’t apologize,” Rox says, clapping her on the shoulder. “I mean, I’D never be caught dead with any of that stuff after spending every day in the parks, but you do you.”
>The oriole rubs her arm in shame
>”Besides, it’s kind of cute how innocent you still are,” the wolfess continues.
>She leans in close to you and winks
>”You should have seen her when we met for the first time. Boy, did I have a lot of work cut out for me trying to corrupt her even to where she is now.”
>”R-Roxie!” Chee cries
>”Geeze, Chee. I thought ‘ruffled feathers’ was just a joke.”
>The bird stamps the ground and fans the air in anger
>”Roxie, this is NOT a joke! You almost got Anon in trouble, you almost got ME in trouble, and you almost got yourself fired!”
>The wolfess opens her mouth to retort, but she’s buffeted by the oriole’s frantic wing smacks
>”You’ve gone too far this time! You’re so reckless and inconsiderate! I’ve learned to put up with you, but you were extremely irresponsible to Anon tonight!”
>Rox’s ears fold back
>She mutters something under her breath and scratches her neck
>Chee puffs her chest out, and the wolfess sulks into her room with her tail between her legs
>You’ve only known Chee for a little while, but you’re kind of proud of her
>You were afraid she was the kind of sweet girl who always let her friend walk all over her
>She turns to you with little dewdrops in her eyes
>”Oh...you don’t think that was too much, do you? I think that was a bit harsh....”
>That poor, naive girl

>Chee grabs a stack of blankets and an extra pillow from her room
>You catch a brief glimpse of it before she returns
>It looks even more furnished with Whimsey toys and souvenirs than the rest of the apartment
>”Until we get this all sorted out, I’m going to follow what Sherry-K says. You can use our couch for a few nights if you need to.”
>Chee spreads the blankets out neatly and tucks the edges under the cushions
>Whistling all the while
>Rox finally comes out of her room with her own wad of crumpled blankets
>”Oh, I was gonna’...alright, guess I won’t need these.”
>Chee folds her wings and taps the floor with a claw
>Waiting
>The wolfess exhales deeply
>”Look, I wouldn’t have done it if it were anyone else but him. Anon and I have been through a lot of shit together, and I just thought...you know...he could handle it.”
>Chee’s tapping becomes faster
>”That sounds like you’re blaming someone else, Roxie,” the bird says
>Rox looks as though she was whipped in the head with a rolled-up newspaper
>”No, no. I’m...sorry, both of you.”
>Chee clicks her tongue
>”That may be the best apology you’re going to get for a while, Anon,” the bird says
>With the initial shock and fear subsided, it’s a little easier to process the whole thing
>Rox IS still your brother-in-arms (or sister, rather) through the season, and it won’t do either one of you good to abandon the other
>You might still be able to say you know her better than anyone else does, given how closely you’ve gotten in the workplace
>Bonding together often without a single word between the two of you
>You probably should be more upset with her than you are, but the whole thing feels like a dream
>There are animal people working alongside you
>They’ve been there this whole time
>And some of them are admittedly pretty attractive...
>You wouldn’t be able to stay mad with Rox forever
>Even Chee looks like she wants everyone to make up rather than go to bed angry
>Though “go to bed” makes you think back to the car ride
>Rox looked pretty flustered about it
>With these anthros surrounded by so many humans day after day, do some of them ever get interested in something that isn’t even their same species?
>No, Rox is just a friend; a pretty cool one, even before you knew she’s a wolf
>And now, maybe she’s a little cooler because of it
>Chee lets out an exaggerated yawn that sounds like she’s singing
>”Well, we’ve all had a long day, and I’m sure tomorrow’s going to be...interesting. Goodnight everyone.”
>”’Night, Chee.”
>You wish the bird a goodnight yourself, seconds before a mass of blankets is dumped on top of you
>”You looked like you could use a few more,” Rox laughs.
>You stumble onto the couch completely smothered in sheets
>”Now you know how I feel most days,” she says. “S’why I usually sleep in the buff.”
>You stop squirming under the covers
>It’s suddenly gotten much hotter underneath them
>You can sense Rox looming over you
>Her muzzle pressing ever so gently into the blankets close to your face
>”You should see the adorable little Whimsey pajamas Chee wears to bed.”
>”ROXIE!” the bird cries from her room
>”G’night Chee!”
>The wolfess pads off, and you’re left to sweat underneath the covers

>You always go to work with at least a little bit of optimism, but you’re outright dreading today
>Chee drops you off near a “backstage” barrier where some of the mascot performers exit into the park through
>One-way exit, for good reasons
>”Didn’t hear anything from Ms. Scowls and Stripes yet,” Rox says before the two girls drive off. “So you might as well pretend none of this happened for now.”
>You’re worried some sort of secret furry police force is going to snipe you the moment you turn a corner
>You slip out onto the park grounds and make your way to the nearest employee backdoor
>Everyone in Whimsey World goes about their visit completely unaware of the creatures who dance and sign autographs amongst them
>You almost envy them
>Almost
>You could probably make a break for it if you truly wanted to, but that would mean missing out on a world of anthros
>It would also mean damning Rox to whatever punishment the others might inflict on her
>And would she miss you?
>Your thoughts are interrupted when a door swings open to block your path
>A hidden door within the hidden tunnels of the backstage?
>You take a peek, and a massive leathery arm sweeps you inside
>It’s a hippo; a coordinator as well
>His pinstripe shirt barely closes over his massive body
>He doesn’t say a word as he bumps you repeatedly down the hallway, until you have the wisdom to move on your own
>The walls of the underground tunnels are lined with familiar safety notices and park schedules, but all of them are designed with anthros in the images rather than humans
>You end up outside an office after minutes of being guided through the park’s underbelly
>The hippo pushes you one final time before shutting you inside the office
>Now you’re all alone
>With Sherry-K
>The tigress is much more intimidating with her shirt neatly buttoned and a clipboard in paw, making scores in the wood with her black nails
>She’s standing there, just staring at you
>As though waiting for you to misstep so she has a reason to discipline you
>You can’t deny there’s a certain regal air to her presence
>Her body is naturally large for being the kind of feline she is, but it’s accentuated in her womanly frame
>Not that she would be the type to flaunt herself if it meant debasing her authority
>She wouldn’t even need the hippo if she had to fight you; you’d be dead from a single swipe if she wanted it
>Any defense you had against her piercing eyes, colored like water-starved grass, is deconstructed as she stares at you
>”I think we have a plan for you, Anon,” Sherry-K rumbles
>You’d rather take your chances with the hippo
>”Your employment at Whimsey World was just about over. I don’t mean premature termination, either. Unfortunately. Now, you’re being offered tenure here.”
>She slinks forward on the tips of her toes
>Ever step looks like she’s preparing to pounce
>”You aren’t being FORCED to work here, per se, but those with more concern for your safety would strongly urge you to remain with us.”
>The tigress is towering before you now
>You can see the wood shavings peel off the clipboard
>”I suppose this means you friend Roksa got what she wanted. I’m assigning you to her as a dedicated mascot handler so I can keep an eye on BOTH of you at the same time. However....”
>One of her claws punches through the clipboard
>”DON’T look at this as leniency, or some kind of reward. I may be one of the head coordinators of ‘our’ branch of the company, but I’m not the one with the final say on matters like this. You can bet if I had my way, we wouldn’t be having this chat right now.”
>She flicks through several of her papers
>”Still, Roksa may have a point. We were considering integrating humans and anthros in our parks, and eventually easing OUR society into yours. If anyone is capable of such a feat, it would be the D. Whimsey Corporation. And so, you’re going to be our case study. You should enjoy this opportunity, but remember: you’ll be acting on behalf of ALL humans. Don’t ruin this for them.”
>It’s going to be a little difficult to enjoy yourself with that kind of responsibility
>”Now, regarding the housing situation: you will of course have to be relocated from the seasonal employee site to one of our own. I’ve already spoken to Roksa and Chee on this matter, and they have agreed to board you. Since it’s meant for only two occupants, the three of you will have to sort things out yourselves.”
>You feel a little guilty for Chee, since she was probably not as enthused about the sudden change in her lifestyle as Rox was
>Then again, she didn’t seem all that bothered to make a bed for you on their couch
>Maybe it’s a bird thing? Instinctual nesting habits?
>That might be a bit too presumptuous...
>Before you know it, the tigress is leaning over you with a snapped clipboard half in each paw
>”Any reprimands given to you in this park, regardless of the source or reason, will be reported back to me. Whimsey World is a place of imagination, and I suggest you use it if you want to know what will happen to you if you step out of line.
>You can see yourself in her eyes, cut in two by the narrow slits of her pupils
>”Do we have an understanding?”
>You nod
>Your head barely comes back up before the hippo is upon you, bouncing you out the door and into the regular “human” hallways
>When you step out onto the colorful park streets, you can see Rox in her Whirly Barf costume once again
>The wolfess gives you an eager wave
>She may have gotten off easier than you did



[[ CHAPTER 3: On the Rox ]]

>Whimsey World has a reputation for creating happiness
>For the park guests, that’s a given
>After all, you don’t get to be voted the top vacation destination on the planet just because your toilets are a little cleaner than most
>But even the employees are treated nicely from time to time when seasonal hours aren’t chiseling away at their souls
>Surprising them with birthday wishes or frequent “just because” awards
>The entire company’s philosophy is built around making every day a magical experience in some way, shape, or form
>No matter who they are, what they do, or how much money they spend
>Except for Anon
>Anon can go to hell
>For the last few months, the most recognition you’ve gotten was a few guests leaning in to read your nametag or asking you to hold the camera
>Now you have every pair of eyes you can’t see watching you
>Are they in the gardens?
>Can they see you from the trashcans?
>Why is that boy staring at you so intently?
>Who is he working for?
>How far could you run if you just took off?
>You almost black out when a large, fuzzy pair of arms tightly wraps around you
>It’s just Rox
>She’s been a lot more playful in her mascot performances than ever before
>Guess nobody told her how serious this is supposed to be
>Then again, maybe this is her way of trying to ease the tension?
>She dances around more than usual, hands out more high-fives, and pantomimes her mascot’s personality with more life
>You have to check that it’s still her in the suit every so often, just to be sure
>”You gotta lighten up, dude,” she whispers. “They’re going to be on your ass even more if it looks like you’re not giving it your all.”
>It’s easier said than done; it’s not HER future on the line
>It’s going to be next to impossible to let your guard down in this kind of environment
>Or at least so you think at first
>When you can get past the paranoia you find yourself actually enjoying the park, even as an employee
>It’s like Rox said, they’ll have no reason to fire you (or worse) if you play along
>So you join in on the festivities
>You react to her antics with more emotion
>You act out scenes with her
>You’re even asked to be included in a few pictures with her by the guests
>All that energy has a limit, though, and soon Rox is signaling to you for a break
>”I need...I need to cool down a bit, she wheezes”
>You’re a little worried for her
>She’s normally pretty resilient to heat, but it’s getting bad for her today
>Honestly, you’re surprised at how well she does with essentially two layers of fur
>You’re not going to object to a little breather, though

>Dotted across the park are various “chill rooms”
>Small escapes for employees to take a break without having to delve into the tunnels below
>They’re inconspicuously built into the theming of the park, so they’re out of sight but never out of reach
>Out here in “Jungle Venture” the nearest chill room is inside of a grass hut
>It’s like a freezer inside
>You help Rox take off her mask
>She’s panting heavily, her fur slick with the moisture of the cooling packs
>”Man, I don’t know what came over me,” she says between labored breaths. “Guess I gave a little TOO much of my all, h-ha ha.”
>You still can’t quite get over the sight in front of you
>Rox, your closest comrade in this wild theme park, is a wolfess
>Never would you have thought something like her could actually exist
>And yet, when you close your eyes she sounds just the same as the girl you’ve always known
>She thumps you on the back
>”Hey...don’t go dying on me!”
>You’re going to try not to
>”Man, I’m boiling. I guess you could call me a....”
>No, Rox
>”Caaall meee aaa....”
>Don’t do it
>”Hhhhhh....”
>Her brow flashes up and down rapidly as she elbows you in the ribs
>You can’t give her the satisfaction
>She’s told the joke at least a hundred times
>Sometimes it has moments where it becomes funny again through repetition
>But something hits you, and it’s not just the wolfess’ playful slaps
>You always assumed she was referring to the costume as the “hot dog” and not the literal canine inside
>”Aww, no fun,” she pouts when she knows you aren’t going to relent, settling for rubbing you in the face with her enormous mitts
>Those costume paws can’t be easy to work with
>Rox doesn’t seem to think so either
>”Anon, I, uh, want to ask you a favor.”
>She sounds pained
>”I’m really, really itchy. Do you mind scratching me a bit?”
>You can hear the subtle whine in the inflection of her voice
>She really means it?
>There’s a bit of hesitation in you
>Just as much from touching a girl as there is touching a wolf
>But there’s only so long you can continue being surprised by this new life of yours
>You’re friends with a wolfess now
>You were ALWAYS friends with a wolfess
>She needs your help, and it isn’t exactly asking for much
>Even in the icebox the two of you are relaxing in, Rox melts from the moment you touch the fur of her neck
>She slumps over with her eyes closed, and as you work your fingers into her coat she lets out a throaty moan
>”Ooo-o-oh yeaaahhh....”
>She sticks her tongue out through her teeth
>She’s a comparatively big girl, but the way she twists and leans into your massage makes her seem like she’s a fraction of her size
>Whether it’s intuition or maybe even a little desire on your part, you work your way up her neck toward the back of her head
>And then up to the sweet spot behind her ears
>Rox inhales sharply, then deflates with a pleased sigh
>”You’re amazing, Anon. Ohh, you’ve got magic fingers, that’s for sure.”
>A shiver wracks her whole body, and not from the cold
>Had you been in her position, the last thing you’d want from a day being around sweaty, loud humans is to be touched by one
>You’re not Rox, and she’s not even like most girls
>She doesn’t just enjoy your contact; she relishes it
>The wolfess collects herself, looking much more rejuvenated now
>She pats you on the head, like a good boy
>”Thanks, bud. I think that should last me until lunch.”
>She puts the mask back on and helps you to your feet
>”Speaking of which, do you know what we should get?”
>You shake your he—
>No!
>“A HOT DOG!”

>The two of you perform outside for a little while longer before heading underground for lunch
>She needs to drop off her costume first but fortunately doesn’t pull you into the locker room this time
>While you’re still half in uniform, she’s in some pretty casual clothes as you make your way to the food
>It’s definitely not the direction you’d normally be going
>Rox keeps you close as you pass several other anthros in the halls
>Their reactions are more on the side of bewilderment and curiosity than surprise or fear
>Obviously most of them were briefed about the human joining their branch of the company, if they hadn’t already seen you at The Booze Cruise last night
>Their cafeteria is almost the same as what you’re used to, only with more fur and feathers
>You gravitate toward the vending machine boxed meals, but the wolfess yanks you into a line with her
>”Ah-ah, what did I tell you? You can use my discount, remember? Wait, screw it; lunch is on me. And that’s just for yesterday. Still gotta scratch YOUR back for today.”
>Rarely do you indulge in the actual cooked food in the cafeteria
>It’s not cheap, much like the rest of Whimsey World
>Being a seasonal employee, you don’t even get good discounts on anything
>Rox, however, gets some pretty sweet perks for how rough her role can be
>You load up a tray, too preoccupied with everything else that’s happened to dwell too long on what exactly “food” is to anthros
>The panda, Cookie, is behind the serving counter today
>Guess bartending is his nightly gig
>The wolfess nudges you over to a vacant table
>Off on the other side of the cafeteria is Chee, sitting with a few other birds and a couple of furs
>There’s still room at her table for the both of you
>”She’s my roommate,” Rox says. “We’re not joined at the hip. I’m sure she’s more than happy to get a break from me now and then.”
>Chee’s table looks packed compared to yours
>Even after sitting down for a few minutes, it’s just the two of you
>Are the rest of the anthros just that afraid of you?
>”Yeah, they’re probably a little skittish, but....”
>Rox grimaces
>”I usually end up eating by myself anyway. The others get a little sick of my shit, ya know? I don’t think even Killjoy-K eats alone, and I’m sure she has to threaten the other coordinators just to get them at her table.”
>Half of Rox’s lunch goes uneaten
>You can’t deny the wolfess has a personality that could be grating to some people
>You haven’t been one of those people
>She’s the first true friend you’ve made in Whimsey World
>”You know, I’m glad you didn’t just run off when I showed you what I am. You’ve already done a ton for me for just hanging around and being a cool guy.”
>It’s not a side you’ve seen from Rox yet, and you’re not sure you like it yet
>There’s something to be said for having a friend you can always trust to be in high spirits
>Fortunately, she has one of her own to help her rebound
>Chee comes over with a bubbly smile on her beak
>”Hey, Roxie! Hey, Anon!”
>The friends she left at her own table watch in awe
>”S’up, Chee. Hey, can I get you anything? I want to make it up to you for last night and everything.”
>The oriole just waves her off
>”We’re roommates, Roxie. We help each other. You don’t have to do anything for me in return.”
>”Yeah, well, at least let me give you some gas money for driving Anon and me here before you go. I’ll probably be hanging around late tonight, so I’ll see you later.”
>Chee blinks
>”But, I was your ride here, and....?”
>Chee looks to you
>You’re already thinking a step ahead of her
>After all, your car’s still out there
>Though a lot has changed since you were “abducted”
>Would they even let you back to it now, with all that extra surveillance on you?
>Before you can say anything, Rox cuts you off
>”Don’t worry. I’m catching a bus back. Hell, I’ll probably just walk home. It’s not that far.”
>The bird looks from you back to her roommate, then back to you
>It’s the look of someone who needs reinforcement
>”Roxie, let Anon take you home!” she blurts out
>”Chee, please. Don’t force that on him.”
>You tell her you were planning on offering regardless
>Rox opens her mouth to decline, but she’s thrown off by Chee’s tickling feather flaps
>”Don’t say anymore! Anon offered! You should go with him!”
>The wolfess looks to you for affirmation
>Of course you’ll take her
>Again, provided you aren’t going to be followed by shady, unmarked cars the whole way back
>”Great!” Chee sings. “And you’re welcome to come to Cast Night, as always!”
>She hops back to her table, her friends eager to ask about you
>Cast Night?
>Rox perks up a bit
>”Yeah, you know how every week the park closes a little earlier?”
>Right, for maintenance?
>The wolfess laughs a toothy laugh, back to her usual self
>”Of course that’s what they’d say to you! No, one night a week ‘our’ employees are allowed to enjoy the place like we were guests. Well, it’s technically alternating weeks, since some of us still need to run the place.”
>She flicks her snout, putting on a cool demeanor
>”Never really did that sort of thing. You get tired of the place sometimes, ya know? Chee’s always trying to drag me out, but....”
>The wolfess drums her nails on the tabletop
>You get the feeling her paw is inching closer
>”Maybe I’ll give it a go this time, if you’re coming along. How about it?”
>You already get access to the park for free on your off days, and it’s almost always in the company of your coworkers
>But a night with your favorite one?
>AND a whole park of anthros?
>How could you miss it?
>Rox slams her paw down, startling those at the nearby tables
>”HA! Ha, I mean, great! I’m sure you’ll make Chee pretty happy. She’s always been the type to gush over the humans.”
>The bird must be able to hone in on embarrassing conversations about her, because she looks back to your table ready to scream out at Rox at a moment’s notice
>That poor girl
>”Well, look,” Rox continues. “Can I at least pay YOU some gas money? I’m already racking up the debt with you, bud. I don’t want to have to start doing something I might regret.”
>Saying that is one of them, apparently
>Her hackles rise at the slip
>”Ahh, forget I said anything. Ready to get back out there?”



[[ CHAPTER 4: Rox Around the Clock ]]

>The rest of your shift goes without a hitch
>Mostly
>Rox dances and moves around with her usual zeal, but she seems to take frequent pauses
>Fidgeting when she does
>”It’s the heat. TEMPERATURE, I mean! It’s just really getting to me today. Must be the shitty cooling packs....”
>Something’s up with her, at any rate
>All the while you’ve thought she was human, she’s never been like this before
>She’s particularly grateful to end the shift today
>Though she said something to Chee about staying late
>As the two of you walk down the anthro employee halls, Rox clutches her mascot mask tightly to her chest
>”It was a lie, alright? I just didn’t want her to feel obligated to take me back home. I’ve been acting like a real ass to her.”
>Now that you can see Rox for who she really is, you notice she’s the type who wears her emotions on her sleeves
>Her ears fold back, and she knocks her forehead against the Whirly Barf mask
>”You heard her, right? ‘We’re roommates. We help each other.’ Meanwhile, I try to get AWAY from her because we’re roommates. I don’t know, maybe I feel like I’m trying to push her away because I feel guilty, you know?”
>Chee doesn’t seem like the kind of girl who would ever hold a lasting grudge, or deliberately guilt someone
>She’s much too nice for that; you could say TOO nice
>If Rox did “corrupt” her a bit, it was probably for the best
>So in the end, the wolfess and the bird compliment each other
>”Thanks again for driving me back,” Rox says. “Hey, we should grab a drink if we’re going to be swinging by the bar for my car, yeah?”
>After a day like today, it might be nice to unwind a bit
>You can feel yourself sweat
>And not from the heat
>Your car is parked in the “human” lot
>There’s no way they’re going to let you out that way, let alone with a wolfess
>And Sherry-K is waiting right around the corner for you to reach that realization
>”Anon, if I may have a word with you in my office,” the tigress says
>Rox looks ready to lash out, but she can’t act on it
>Undoubtedly she’s on a bit of a leash as well
>”You can wait out here,” Sherry-K says curtly to the wolfess
>The office door clacks shut, and the two of you are alone
>You wonder how much sound can carry through the walls as the tigress opens a large filing cabinet
>It’s filled with fresh clipboards
>The company must have a budget for supplies for her to break if needed
>”First of all, good job today,” she says
>A genuine compliment?
>That can’t last long
>”I’ve had several observers keep tabs on the two of you, and apart from a suspiciously prolonged break in one of the chill rooms you both seemed to carry yourselves professionally.”
>So she knows you and Rox had a moment in there
>Or at least that something COULD have happened
>”Contrary to what you might think with all this extra...surveillance on you, the D. Whimsey Corporation respects the boundaries of its employees. However....”
>The gently swishing of the tigress’ tail during her speech goes still
>”I would encourage you to refrain from any workplace dating here on the park grounds. The happiness of the GUESTS comes first and foremost.”
>You try your best to act as though this is common sense
>”Very well. Now then, I wanted to talk to you about your parking situation, as I’m sure you already have some concerns.”
>That you do
>”The current plan is to let you use your vehicle as you see fit when outside of the park grounds. However, you must carpool with either Roksa or Chee in order to enter our specific employee parking. We’ve moved your vehicle over to our lot just for today. Understood?”
>Now the guilt sets in
>You don’t want to be a burden on either of them any more than you have been already
>”This may only be temporary, depending on how well you comply. If neither Roksa nor Chee are available, someone will come by to pick you up. Do you have any questions?”
>Nope
>”Good. You may leave, though I hope it goes without saying I’d like you to keep these meetings of ours confidential.”
>Of course she would
>But as long as you don’t turn around and blab to anyone, you should be fine
>Rox backs away from the door hurriedly as you exit
>You can tell she wants to know what happened, but it’s too soon to say anything
>When you get back to your car, Rox isn’t so impatient about it anymore
>”Let’s just wait until we get to the bar. I’m sure it’ll be good for a laugh.”
>The wolfess has to duck a bit to fit into the passenger seat
>Her toned legs lean up against the dashboard
>”Not a bad ride,” she shrugs. “Not a lot of room, though, but it’s not like you were planning on shoving someone like me in, right?”
>You turn on some music as you drive off to the bar
>Avoiding the “Whimsey Channel” that broadcasts park music 24/7 to any radio in the area
>”A bit more room in the backseats for us, at least,” Rox continues
>It takes you a moment to think about what she might be implying
>It takes her only a moment more to think about what you might be thinking
>”Ack! I mean ‘us’ as in ‘our’ kind! Not...not like US two!”
>Rox clamps her muzzle shut with her paws
>After a minute of silence, she turns the dial up louder

>Back at the Booze Cruise
>Less than 24 hours ago you were here on display for a bar’s worth of shocked anthros
>Not to say they are much less surprised to see you this time, but it at least doesn’t cause the uproar the first time did
>You see some familiar faces, but none of them belonging to any tigers
>Thankfully
>”You caught Ms. Prissy Pelt in a rare bar sighting,” Rox snickers. “She must have had quite a shitty day to show her face around here. Probably gave out an all-time low for reprimands or something.”
>”Well this feels familiar!” you hear Chee say
>She hops over to you and Rox, giving the wolfess a squinted look
>”At least you didn’t drag any OTHER humans in here, but didn’t you say you were working late tonight?”
>You’ve already picked up on some of Rox’s subtle tells for when she’s not giving the exact truth
>”Ah, I thought I did. Got out on time, I guess. Sherry-K wanted to see Anon pretty soon after our shift anyway.”
>Chee blinks at you
>”What did she want with you?” she says
>”I’d like to hear that, too,” Rox adds
>The three of you grab drinks and find a table
>Cookie doesn’t seem to be on “bar time” just yet; there’s a burly looking badger woman behind the counter for now
>After settling in, you tell the girls of you meeting with the tigress
>And checking around you all the while, just in case
>”’Workplace dating?’” Rox scoffs. “That’s a laugh. Probably isn’t getting any herself so she has to ruin everyone else’s fun.”
>”Maybe she actually has a bit of a crush on Anon?” Cheer offers
>Rox slaps the table in hysterics
>”Oh, Chee, Chee, Chee...you’re so adorable.”
>”W-what?” Chee sputters, agitated
>”If you think she’s got a taste for Anon, you’re a bit in the dark,” Rox says, pulling the oriole into her arm. “She’s more into munching the carpet.”
>Chee just blinks
>”She’s playing for the other team, Chee.”
>”I-I don’t....”
>Oh, that poor, sheltered girl
>”She’s a LESBIAN, Chee!” Rox hisses
>”Roxie! That’s a terrible thing to assume!”
>”C’mon, Chee. Are you really that surprised? Look where we work! Hell, Anon can vouch for me about the ratio of the parade dancers; especially the guys!”
>No comment from you
>And Chee’s not convinced
>”Do you know for sure?”
>”Well...no. But when you’ve spent so much time getting written up in her office you start picking up certain things about how she acts. It’s a hunch.”
>Chee turns up her beak
>”Hmph. Well, just don’t go spreading any rumors, or you’ll REALLY be in trouble.”
>”Thanks, mom.”
>Now you need to spring the news on them about carpooling
>You’re not so sure they’re going to want to house you AND drive you every day to wo—
>”Of course we’ll help you!” The bird chirps
>”Yeah, we got your back, dude,” Rox adds. 
>She pulls you into her other arm, so the three of you are bunched up together
>“It’s like Chee said: ‘We’re roommates’.”
>Welp, that wasn’t so bad
>”Buuut you have to come to Cast Night!” Chee says, wagging her feathers at you
>She turns to the wolfess
>”You too, Roxie!”
>”Yeah, fine.”

>It’s getting late when the three of you get back to the apartment
>”I, erm, gotta take a call. I’ll be in my room,” Rox mutters
>She locks herself in, and Chee sighs with amusement
>”She always does this. Who makes a call this late?”
>She leans in and whispers behind a wing
>”I think she just doesn’t want me to see her working out. I’m always hearing grunting and panting coming from her room when she does this. We have an exercise room downstairs, after all.”
>Working out?
>She has to be playing you; nobody can be as naive as Chee
>She heads to her own room in her sweet obliviousness, leaving you alone on the couch
>Rox’s muffled noises can be heard for a while
>It’s only slightly quieter than the whispers of curiosity in your ear
>Now it’s slightly quieter than the heartbeat in your ear as you creep up to her room
>You ease yourself against the door and listen
>There’s little to be left to imagination
>You hear the grunting, the gasping, the groaning of bedsprings
>”A-ah...a-ah...a-ah....”
>Whatever’s going on, she has a good rhythm going
>You start to feel a little shame for what you’re doing, until something catches your attention
>Her strained huffs become structured words, and you listen intently like a parent experiencing the first speech of their child
>”A-ah...Ahhhnnn...Onnn....”
>No way
>There aren’t any other Anons she works with, are there?
>Of course not
>So is it really so surprising she’d be calling YOUR name?
>Maybe that’s a little presumptuous
>Well you don’t have much time to dwell on those thoughts before you realize all the noise has stopped
>You glide back over to the couch and throw yourself onto it as nonchalantly as you can
>Only a minute passes, but it feels as though you barely made it in time
>Rox steps out in sweat shorts and a tank top
>Her knees are very softly shaking
>You manage to catch the unmistakable bumps showing through her shirt right before she covers her chest
>You don’t know if she caught you looking, but it seems as though she wasn’t expecting you to be sitting right outside
>”Just gotta...drink of water,” she mumbles
>You keep your eyes focused on the floor
>Then the reflections in the window
>Rox takes large gulps of water and refills her glass repeatedly
>All the while her tail shakes worse than her legs did
>That’s when you notice she must be wearing shorts not meant for tails like she normally has
>They’re sliding down the back past the base, showing off the top half of her furry, dark gray rump
>A lazy paw drifts down to scratch an itch on her hip, and that’s when she notices the wardrobe malfunction
>She slams the glass down with enough force that you’re amazed nothing chipped off
>The sound is enough to drop your gaze again
>You keep looking down as Rox quickly pads back to her room
>”Goodnight everyone!” Chee calls out
>You and Rox fumble your responses



[[ CHAPTER 5: Rox Bottom ]]

>Another day, another shift with the eyes of every anthro on you
>Rox drives you to work today, though her outgoing personality is more subdued
>There’s no way she knows about the eavesdropping last night, right?
>You think maybe it would have been better if the two of you worked different shifts for the afternoon, but shortly after you started working at Whimsey World you never worked a day without Rox
>Almost as if she changed her schedule to work around yours
>But that’s crazy...right?
>”Hey, Anon?”
>You tense up
>Silence
>”Ah, forget it. I’ll tell you later.”
>That only puts you more on edge from the anticipation
>And you’re already on edge because of how close Rox is cutting it on the way to work
>She’s not known for being exceptionally punctual
>Well, maybe today will be all right
>Forcing a smile all day might somehow relieve the stress
>Though first you have to have another check-in with Sherry-K
>Now you’re downright paranoid
>Does SHE know something?
>You have no idea what might be getting back to her, like Rox’s outburst about the tigress’ sexuality
>Fortunately, she just wants a quick word with you
>”Please try to be on time for the future,” she says, marking up her clipboard with pen and nail
>She gives you stony look with those sun-bleached, grassy eyes
>”Now then, I’m sure you’ve been caught up to speed about company Cast Nights, correct? Since you’ve arrived with Roksa today, I’ll ALLOW you to join her rotation. Starting next week, however, you’ll be expected to learn park operations so you may give your fellow employees their turn for leisure.”
>Sounds easy enough
>As a seasonal worker you’ve only ever been trained as a mascot, but learning how to run the rides could be interesting
>...Wait, so do anthros ever run the rides during the daytime?
>”Run the rides, cook the food, and even handle customer service calls. There’s a lot more to this company than the average guest realizes, Anon. The D. Whimsey Corporation’s best kept secrets stay secrets for a reason.”
>You can see her pearly whites as her lip curls up into a scowl
>”Even park accidents are smothered to prevent bad publicity. You wouldn’t want to be one of those accidents, would you?”
>Nope, this day isn’t going to be any less stressful

>The morning, noon, and afternoon goes by with caution
>Caution for you because of your little chat with the tigress
>Caution for Rox because she’s trying not to overexert herself like yesterday
>When you think about the evening and Cast Night, the clock goes by even slower
>You’re actually looking forward to it
>Despite working in the park nearly every day of the week, you often find yourself spending your days off here
>But never have you gotten to spend the time with Rox
>Nor have you seen the park through the eyes of its undercover anthros
>Night comes, and the employees go through the familiar routines of park closure
>Clean up trash, turn off lights, corral guests back to the front gates...
>You go through the motions as well, letting Rox have a few last-minute interactions with some kids who aren’t quite ready to end their magical vacation
>When it comes to the time you’d normally be heading home, you and Rox change into more casual clothes
>Again, in separate locker rooms
>She’s in the same jeans and t-shirt you’re honestly surprised you remember
>After all, you were focusing all your attention on the wolfess who stepped out of a Whimsey World costume
>”Alright, you ready?”
>She holds out a paw
>You try to take it
>She psyches you out and instead wraps her arm around your shoulders
>”Your call, I guess. Not really into the rides all that much, but I’ll go wherever you want.”
>Now you have the pressure of trying to get Rox to have a good time
>”We should probably stop and say ‘hi’ to Chee at some point.”
>Oh, that’s right
>Chee’s on the opposite Cast Night rotation, so she’s running the rides on days when Rox would be in the park
>Though it sounds like the wolfess never comes to these anyway
>The lights are only half on as the two of you walk around, likely to keep outside suspicion to a minimum
>Most of these anthros can probably see in darker environments anyway
>One big change is all the food set up on tables outside of the usual restaurants and stalls
>It’s going to go to waste at the end of the day, so these animal employees get free grub
>”Really wish this place served beer...” Rox grumbles
>That’s what The Booze Cruise is for
>It’d explain why it’s such a popular spot for Whimsey workers
>True to her word, Rox goes where you do
>You hit up a few of your favorite rides, with no wait
>There’s an anthro running solo at almost all of them
>The park is such a well-oiled machine it hardly even needs its skeleton crew to operate
>Which is a shame, because you really wanted to see some more of the anthros in their relaxed state without half of them just pushing buttons
>At least you get to see the panda Cookie squeeze himself into the spinning teacups in glee
>Some of Chee’s friends are skipping around as well, leading you and Rox toward the bird’s post
>Among the girls are a gull named Petch and a vixen named Mionra
>Both keep checking over their shoulders and giggling at the sight of you
>You’re worried Rox might be a little territorial about you, but she’s completely unfazed by the girls
>She just snickers herself and pulls you in snugly
>”Don’t worry, I’m not jealous. They’re...well, Chee would be angry if I said anything again.”
>The wolfess winks

>Of course Chee would be running “Little Happy Planet”
>A mind-numbingly saccharine boat ride with vibrant colors and ear-grating music
>She’s clapping her wings as the two of you approach
>”Glad you came out for once!” the oriole squeals to Rox
>”Yeah, yeah. Just stopping by to say hello,” the wolfess replies
>Chee looks bothered
>”What? No, you guys gotta go and take a ride! You’re already here and everything.”
>”Chee...”
>Whether she means to or not, Chee certainly gets what she wants through her sweetness
>”Alright, fine,” Rox groans. “Just make sure you stall everyone else so they don’t see us going through.”
>Chee is bouncing up and down with joy
>Rox looks around the roped queue
>”Uh, you going to let us through, or...?”
>”Nuh-uh, you have to go through the line like everyone else!”
>Rox looks ready to leap over the ropes, but you’re there to reel her in
>Roommates, after all...
>”We can’t go into the boats anyway, Chee. There are two docks.”
>The bird blinks
>”I don’t...what?”
>”Look, two docks. It’s impossible, Chee. It’s a pair-a-docks.”
>Goddammit, Rox...
>Chee is left puzzled as the two of you zigzag through the queue
>You step into a pastel boat and the torture begins
>You haven’t even gotten out of the station fully and you’re already regretting the ride
>{~La la la, sun and joy!~}
>{~Ho ho ho, girls and boys~}
>Please, make it stop
>Please, make it stop
>Please
>You have to literally yank Rox back in by the tail to keep her from escaping
>She’s pulling at clumps of fur in frustration
>”How can this get any worse?”
>Now she’s done it
>Here comes the karma
>Halfway through the ride everything slows to a halt
>How does a motorless boat even break down?
>Luckily, even the music cuts out
>”CHEE!” Rox screams
>Just an echo responds
>Now you wouldn’t blame her for trying to escape
>But even though it’s the perfect opportunity, Rox just sits quietly
>You’re reminded of how tall she is compared to you
>Though she looks vulnerable with her head hung low
>”Anon, I wanted...I wanted to apologize. For real this time.”
>She wasn’t exactly having the time of her life tonight, but now she looks downright upset
>Her dark gray fur camouflages her in the dim light, but those gold eyes brighten up the boat
>”Chee was right, I really could have fucked everything up big time. I kind of did. You’re stuck here for who knows how long, all because of me. Now you’re forced to work here, forced to room with us. You could have gotten really hurt, or....”
>Her ears fold so far back they almost touch behind her head
>”I didn’t want you to leave, Anon! You’re the coolest guy I know, and honestly one of the few friends I actually have. Every minute I had to dance next to you and couldn’t let you know what I am...it just ate away at me.”
>She’s starting to get choked up
>”I knew your season was just about over, and I thought, you know, maybe I could at least show you something special before...before we split for good. I didn’t know what would happen, and I didn’t care....”
>You reach out for the wolfess, but she scoots away
>”I was only thinking about myself and my own wants, and now you’re caught up in everything, too. I didn’t want this. I just wanted you to be happy. I’m sorry, Anon. I really, really am.”
>Rox lets out a staggered sigh, followed by a wet snort
>As if powered by her apology, the boat begins to float forward again
>”And I’ll understand if you never forgive me for it. I sure as hell wouldn’t if I were in your shoes.”
>She leans over the side of the boat, splashing the water fruitlessly
>You’re worried she might try something rash and drown herself
>You put your hands on her shoulders and haul her back in
>She’s sincere about how sorry she is, there’s no denying it
>And there’s no sense in living in the past
>Time to show her there’s no hard feelings
>You move your hands to her neck and start scratching
>”Hey...what’re you...”
>*scritch scritch scritch*
>Your fingers work into her fur deeply
>”I don’t deserve this, Anon. Stop...don’t...”
>Her head droops even farther, leaving her open for ear scratches
>”Don't...stop...”
>*scritch scritch scritch*
>”Oh...don’t stop...”
>Rox’s tongue flops out as you dig into her sweet spot
>She sways like a pendulum for a while, until she leans too far in and collapses onto your lap with a heavy weight
>Now your fingers are dancing up and down her back
>Making frequent stops back at her ears
>”Hnnnggg,” she grunts
>You’ve dismantled the wolfess, and now she’s putty in your hands
>Every new motion brings a different reaction out of her
>Once you realize the ride has been continuing for a while now, you’ve completely drowned out the annoying music with the sounds of Rox’s moans and sighs
>The attention gets too much for her
>She pushes herself off your lap, only to grab your face tightly
>Her muzzle mashes against your lips
>Her own lips engulf your whole mouth, licking your cheeks before her tongue enters to try and find yours
>You continue your gentle scratching as the two of you share the vigorous kiss
>*CLICK*
>You can see a flash of light even through your closed eyelids
>The two of you separate immediately, looking around for the source
>”Shhhit,” Rox whispers. “Forgot about the photo op.”
>There isn’t much left of the ride at this point, and you and the wolfess sit like obedient schoolchildren
>The boat eventually comes to rest at the station, and you amble out toward the gift shop
>Everything’s shut down or covered over
>Except for the photo counter
>”Welcome back!” Chee sings. “Would you like the 5x7s, the 8x10, or maybe even the poster size?”
>Up on the monitor are you and Rox swapping spit, in vivid color and crisp quality
>”If you don’t want to pay, you can always...charge it to your room.”
>There’s an impish smile on the bird’s face
>You knew it
>She’s been just acting innocent this whole time
>”CHEE! If you don’t take that down NOW I’m taking back pin collection I gave you!”
>”W-what!? No, Roxie, please!”
>Never mind
>You can hardly wait to see what kind of battleground the apartment is going to be like tonight



[[ CHAPTER 6: Get your Rox Off ]]

>By the time you and Rox leave “Little Happy Planet”, Cast Night is basically over
>Both of you look a little relieved
>Chee does as well, though that might just be because she wants to get home and protect her Whimsey pin collection from Rox’s wrath
>You and the wolfess are dead silent on the drive back
>She isn’t even trying to mask the tension with music
>The wolfess sharply inhales every few seconds
>Preparing a speech
>You steel yourself with every draw of her breath
>”So...” Rox says at last. “THAT happened. I, uh, hope it was good for you, too.”
>It actually kind of was, but more than just because of the arousal
>Rox finally got that apology off her chest, which she’s clearly been dreading
>On top of that, she’s shown she has stronger feelings for you than you ever expected
>Rox may have been a little brash in flinging you into all this, but it must have been hard to keep those emotions under a stifling costume for months
>You helped her pull through
>And you got a pretty saucy kiss out of it
>So all in all, pretty good night
>Rox reinforces your sentiments
>”It’s been a little heavy for me, Anon, especially these past few days. All that stress, all that secrecy...it wears on a girl, you know? God, those scratches...that pushed me over the edge.”
>She shivers from the memory, her fur fluffing up a bit
> Is that all it took?
>Good to know, you tell her
>”I’m gonna be honest with you, Anon,” she responds with a weak laugh. “I don’t think that’s enough for me. I’d hoped we could make a good pair ever since I met you, and I really hope we can get a little, uh, ‘closer’. But...I won’t push things again. I made that mistake once, and until you’re ready I’ll try to get by with just the scratches.”
>So, how far do your feelings for Rox go?
>A few days ago you couldn’t even entertain the thought of anthros existing, let alone one that has deep dealings for you
>Now there’s one who’s essentially saying she wants to get in your pants someday
>You can’t say that happens much to you
>Especially with a girl who looks so...soft
>You don’t want to rush into things and potentially destroy what you have with her so far
>But maybe in the near future you can help her with “working out” her needs
>Rox winces when you joke about this
>”So, you heard about that, huh? Figures.”
>Was Chee really being sincere when she said that’s what it was?
>Or does she have a secret mischievous streak?
>After all, it’s no coincidence the ride just shut down like that when the two of you were in the perfect place to be stuck alone
>>”Pfft, nah. I know Chee, and she’s a naïve chick at heart. I probably know more about a bird’s anatomy than she does.”
>Rox slaps herself on the muzzle
>”NOT that I have firsthand experience. I meant through the kind of sites she probably never goes to.”
>You can almost here her gulp
>”I’m not making things better am I? Don’t worry, I don’t even really...”
>She laughs sheepishly
>”I don’t even really like WOVLES all that much either. Ever since I started working at the park, all I can think about is humans.”
>Are any of the other anthros like that? How many?
>”Who knows. There’s a limit to how much I pry into others’ lives, trust me. Wouldn’t be surprised at the number of ‘human hunters’, though. I bet a lot of them come here specifically to be around you guys.”
>Anthros must obviously live outside of Whimsey World then if they don’t all work here
>Rox cycles through a whole assortment of emotions within the span of a few seconds
>Excitement, then disappointment, then anger, then shame
>She ends it all with a sigh
>”Now there’s something I REALLY want to show you, but it could blow up in our faces ten times worse than what happened so far if we’re not careful.”
>She drums her digits on the steering wheel
>You’ve been sitting in the parking lot of the apartment for a few minutes now
>”I’ll work on that, but it’s going to be rough. Gonna need ‘special permission’ for this one.”
>From Sherry-K?
>Rox shakes her head
>”She’s going to be the first step, sadly, but we’ll need to talk to the higher-ups eventually.”
>The wolfess stares off into the night
>”Including the big man himself.”
>You’re mystified by her vagueness, but then it hits you
>There’s only one man you’re sure ANYONE would be more than a little nervous to approach
>Rox nods
>”D. Whimsey Jr.”
>Ho boy...
>”One of the only other humans who knows we exist.”

>When the two of you stop sitting in the parking lot like a couple of creepers you find Chee already back at the apartment
>She runs out from her room, with her pin collection presumably safeguarded
>”Well?” she says, looking you and Rox over. “Didja’ have a good time?”
>”I think you know the answer to that, Chee,” Rox says
>The bird doesn’t know how to take that
>”But...it was fun, right? You had a good time, right?”
>You shrug your shoulders in agreement
>Rox blows a puff of air sharply
>”Yeah, I guess we did. Well, apart from the little cupid trying to make things complicated.”
>Chee pouts
>”But you two looked so cute together! Look!”
>She whips out several photos of “that moment”
>”Chee...” Rox groans
>She thumbs through the pictures
>They’re all pretty nice quality
>”Hang on. Chee, where’s the rest?”
>The oriole just blinks
>”What do you mean?”
>”These are 5x8s. They come in sets of two. I’m only seeing three right here.”
>The wolfess’ eyes narrow
>”Chee...where is it?”
>”I, uh...nnugghh...it’s in my locker!”
>Chee WAS one of the only employees who ran Cast Night still in her uniform
>It’d make sense she went to her locker afterward
>”I hope you’re right, Chee,” Rox warns. “I can handle a little flak if one of our own found it, but if you left it out in the open for a human to find we’re going to be in deep shit.”
>”I didn’t, Roxie! I swear I have it in my locker! I’ll bring it back tomorrow!”
>The bird looks on the verge of tears
>”Don’t...c’mon, Chee. It’s all right. Just, please get rid of it before something else happens to it, okay?”
>Chee nods furiously
>The three of you get ready for bed
>Despite the tension, it’s mutual that nobody wants to go to sleep angry
>Chee’s off in her room singing
>Whimsey songs, of course
>Rox keeps looking from her own room to your couch
>You can see the gears turning in her eyes, but they’re gears that also turn her ears down
>”Maybe we should just take things slow.”
>She’s talking to herself more than you, and doesn’t sound happy with herself
>It’s really HER limitation not to move things along faster, but it might be better to be the voice of reason here
>Then again, such a spunky girl like Rox would probably be an animal in bed
>Yikes, it’s a good thing she didn’t hear that groaner of a joke...
>Rox chews on her lips
>She leans in closely
>You can see yourself in her golden eyes
>Her muzzle opens ever so slightly
>And she whispers to you
>”We should wait until a night when...”
>The wolfess points to Chee’s room
>Right, waiting
>Sure
>You can do that
 
>Your synchronized schedules means you and Rox have the weekend together
>Chee’s working, but she’ll be free tomorrow to join in
>You almost expect Rox to jump you the moment her roommate leaves for the day
>But she holds off, true to her word
>Still, she can’t help herself from taking a quick, discreet sniff of your couch-bed as she reclines on it
>”Until I get things squared away with management, our options are kind of limited.”
>That’s true
>On a day like today you’d normally be either in the parks for free or running errands
>Now you’re living like the anthros do, except maybe even more restricted on where you can go until she gets that “permission”
>She must see a little bit of disappointment or guilt on your face
>”Hey, I didn’t mean it like that. Don’t ever feel bad about all this. This is MY fault, so just let me set things right.”
>She stretches her limbs, showing her full, tall length
>”Welp, no big deal. It’s been a while since I’ve hung around the place all day. Could be a little relaxing.”
>You both mill about the apartment for a while doing mundane time wasters
>Tidying up, checking phones, staring at the walls
>When lunch rolls around it’s ramen on the menu
>The meal of choice for bachelors and bachelorettes alike
>The pantry is stocked full of the stuff
>Is it speciesist to think it’s mostly for Chee?
>”Actually it’s mine,” Rox grumbles. “She’s a little more responsible with her money. If we didn’t have our rent automatically taken out of our paychecks I’d probably need her to bail me out of that, too.”
>Maybe you could take Rox out for a nice meal?
>Oh, wait...
>Never mind
>You feel bad for the restless wolfess
>You tell her if she wanted to head out and get some fresh air you’d be fine waiting for her to get back
>Especially tomorrow, when it’s going to be all three of you
>You don’t want to be the one to keep Chee cooped up as well
>...Man, Rox’s bad puns have really worn off on you
>”Don’t sweat it,” she says. “I’d rather spend a slow day with a guy like you than a busy day by myself.”
>She gives you a friendly smile
>”Not that I even remember what it’s like to work a day without you, Anon. I powered through a few sick days ‘cause I didn’t want to miss spending time together.”
>She chuckles nervously
>”So, you know, this is fine by me. For now, anyway. First thing I’ll do when we head back to work is swallow my pride and have a chat with our favorite coordinator. We’ll figure this out.”
>Sounds like a plan
>Though it doesn’t exactly fix how boring today has been
>What is she normally doing when she isn’t working?
>”Waiting for my next shift,” Rox says glumly
>What about movies, or games?
>”It’s all Chee’s, so that means it’s all Whimsey stuff.”
>Not a fan?
>The wolfess sighs
>”Don’t really want to get into it much. I guess I’m just sick of the cutesy shit. Don’t we get enough of that at work?”
>True
>But there’s something about Whimsey that makes it difficult to stay tired of it forever

>The clock ticks away unhurriedly
>Rox is literally beating her head against the wall
>If there’s anything you could do to make her happy...
>Right on cue, her phone buzzes
>She checks the message and taps a few responses with her sharp nails
>Those anthro phones gotta have some pretty strong glass
>You think of Chee, and how you’ve never seen HER use a phone
>Now you’re really curious how that works
>Speaking of the bird...
>”She says she’s meeting up with some friends. Won’t be around until much later.”
>Now’s your chance
>”Great, now she can’t suffer through this with us. Doesn’t know what she’s missing out on.”
>The wolfess glances over to you
>”What’re you looking at?”
>A perfect opportunity
>You crack your knuckles and make for her ears
>”Don’t think about it, bub. We’re taking it slow, remember? Don’t burn me out on scratches so soon.”
>You get closer
>”No! I don’t want them now!”
>She flops onto her back, putting her ears out of your reach
>Now she screwed up
>Her paws are on her head, leaving her entire abdomen exposed
>Even her shirt rides up a bit, showing her furry midriff
>It’s just waiting for you
>You dig your hands into her pelt, thumbs on her belly button
>”N—aaahhh!” she gasps
>Her whole body tenses up
>And you’re going to make it melt
>You rub your hands up and down her stomach
>First in a line, then in arcs
>Then ending each rub with little swirls
>Rox is completely paralyzed by your touch
>Every inch of this girl’s body has to be one big erogenous zone
>Whenever you change directions one of her legs twitches
>Her tail fruitlessly squirms, pinned underneath her rump
>”Y-you...” she tries to say
>Her paws are covering her eyes
>”You don’t...hah...play fair...”
>You don’t want to push your luck with her, but you also want to tease her a bit
>After her stomach has gotten enough attention, you curve your hands to her hips
>You continue the rubbing up and down her sides, ending just below the breast
>Rox’s back arches beyond her control as though she’s bucking against gravity itself
>She grabs on to the couch in a death grip, digging her claws into the upholstery
>If she’s trying to make intelligible words, they’re definitely scrambled by moans and heavy breathing
>Her chest heaves enough to strain her shirt
>Her tongue flops out and saliva dribbles out of her mouth
>Her golden eyes vanish as they roll into her skull
>She doesn’t even feel like a wolfess anymore; she’s just a lump of putty wearing a furry coat
>But her body starts to feel more rigid before long
>She’s desperately fighting to regain her composure
>You redouble your efforts to break her down again
>”N-NO!” she cries out
>She’s borderline frothing by now
>”A-A-ANON, S-S-TOAAHHH!”
>Her body convulses, and you feel a spasm work its way down her core
>You go still as she shakes violently
>What have you done?
>You were just out for belly rubs
>Did you really make her...?
>A sudden burst of adrenaline from the wolfess knocks you over as she scrambles to her feet
>Rox darts into the bathroom and slams the door shut
>First the sink kicks on, then the shower, then the fan
>But no matter how much noise she makes, you can hear her guttural whines over the roar of the water

>Rox stays in the bathroom for quite some time
>Eventually, you hear the noises shut off one at a time
>Followed by one last broken exhale
>The door swings open, and the wolfess teeters out into the living room
>Her clothes are splotched and her back is hunched
>Even then she’s still a fair bit taller than you
>You haven’t left the couch the whole time, so she returns with a glazed look in her eyes
>The wolfess eases herself down with quivering legs and lays her head in your lap
>”Please,” she grunts, pointing to her ears. “Just be gentle.”
>You stroke her neck and head gingerly
>You’re worried you might have killed the poor girl by the way she’s so motionless
>So you’re relieved when she starts snoring quietly
>She doesn’t stir at all when the lock clicks and the apartment door opens
>Fortunately, Chee didn’t bring her friends home with her
>”Oh!” she peeps, then lowers her voice
>”She looks zonked out. I was afraid you two would be bored. You must have worked out together, huh?”
>Yeah
>”Worked out”
>The bird tiptoes over to the couch and pats her roommate on the head
>”Goodnight, you two,” she breathes. “I’ll see you in the morning!”
>Guess you’re sleeping on the couch again after all



[[ CHAPTER 7: Rox of Ages ]]

>It wasn’t the most comfortable sleep you’ve ever had
>Sitting upright on the couch with a heavy wolfess head on your lap
>Whatever you did to Rox last night—and you have a good idea what that was—really took it out of her
>Maybe she doesn’t have the tolerance for that kind of roughhousing just yet
>Or your scratches were just so intense and she was just that backed up
>It’s going to make the bedroom really interesting someday if she’s that hypersensitive to stimulation
>It’s hard not to feel a little bad, though
>You took her by surprise and rubbed her belly until, well, you got her off on it
>You can’t really beat around the bush about it anymore
>It seemed like she was enjoying herself, at least up until the end
>And she came back to you after it was all done, right?
>Chee comes out of her room looking like she always has the best sleep of her life
>”Morning!” she tweets
>Rox stirs awake, but then locks up
>”Tell me how bad it is,” she whispers to you
>She’s probably talking about her current condition
>Mostly her clothes
>Any sort of “moisture” that would have stained them is gone now
>Though hopefully Chee doesn’t have a better sense of smell than you do...
>You pat Rox’s head reassuringly
>She grabs your wrist
>”You stay away from those ears, you perv.”
>”Did you say something, Roxie?” Chee says
>”Nothing,” the wolfess grumbles
>”Sooo, did you guys have any plans for today?”
>”Not really, no. Can’t exactly ALL go out together until we figure out how to make things work with Anon.”
>Chee’s feathers puff out the way you’ve seen her do whenever she’s about to get excited about something
>”We should all go to the Cast Complex! Anon can still go since it’s technically still in the park, right?”
>”Ah geeze, Chee,” the wolfess says. “Don’t you EVER get sick of work?”
>”But it’s not work if we’re having fun when we’re there!”
>Rox isn’t quite at the mental OR physical level to argue with her roommate, so she relents
>”You win. Better than being stuck in here again all day. Just let us get cleaned up first.”
>”Roxie, when are you going to stop exercising in your room? I want to go work out with you and Anon, too.”
>You’re not sure exactly want kind of noise it is, but Rox certainly makes one

>Whimsey has a pretty respectable amount of space set aside for employee recreation and benefits for their “Cast Complexes”
>Apart from sizeable cafeterias, there are a handful of auditoriums for movie nights and other presentations
>Places to get a haircut or your non-costume clothes cleaned
>And several shops for discounted Whimsey merchandise
>So you’re more than a little surprised when all these commodities also have anthro counterparts as well, albeit in much more enclosed spaces
>Though you suppose these things need to exist for those who practically live in the park
>One of the only things you see that isn’t also on the human side is a station for an underground monorail
>Rox and Chee steer you away as you get too close
>”That’s for us to go to and from the park unnoticed,” the wolfess says. “Until you’re good to go see the rest of our little society, I’m not going to take any chances showing you off to everyone.”
>That’s not a bad plan
>Technically you’re allowed to leave the park by yourself as long as you’re not seen in the company of the anthros, but you haven’t even attempted that in fear of being watched
>You probably have more freedom than you realize, but you’re not going to test your limits just yet
>Besides, isn’t this life better than what you had?
>Well, maybe “more unusual” is a better choice of words
>After a late lunch of the typical cafeteria variety, the three of you head toward a small museum of the company’s history
>Rox lets out an exaggerated sigh
>”C’mon, Chee. Are we really going to spend the whole day here?”
>”Of course not!” the oriole says. “We need to get to the clearance shop before it closes, after all! But I want to at least see the show while we’re here.”
>”Chee, you must have seen that thing like a hundred times by now.”
>The bird opens her mouth to give an exact number, but backs down with a sheepish look
>You all take a quick stroll through the main exhibits first
>There’s a similar one in the park itself for the guests, but it’s kind of nice to see it without a mess of kids smearing up the glass cases or leaning against the plaques
>It’s also interesting to see the company through the eyes of the anthros
>D. Whimsey has always been an interesting figure to you, but now even more than ever
>Did he know going into the construction of the park he’d be sheltering a bunch of animal people, or were accommodations made after the fact?
>Or was the whole place somehow made for them first, and the amusement park was the afterthought?
>Your gaze wanders to a pretty well known image of Mr. Whimsey and his pet beagle, Chobbo
>It’s the only picture of Whimsey and his dog to ever be released publicly
>Both of their goofy faces are pressed together to fit the frame
>The more you look at it, the more you start to realize just how expressive Chobbo is in the photo
>Almost humanly expressive
>”Anon! Come on!” Chee cries out
>”Relax, the movie’s not going anywhere,” Rox groans
>She’s not wrong
>Unlike the perpetual showings of the human version in the park, here there’s only a button for the anthros to get the film going when they need it to
>It’s just the three of you alone in the tiny theater
>Chee is vibrating as the intro music swells
>Rox just rolls her eyes
>”So, how much riffing you think we can get out of this?” she mutters to you
>”Roxie, shh!”
>The show is a fairly short mix of old footage from the early days of the parks construction, spliced together with some sentimental images of modern-day achievements
>The old stuff gives you a strong feeling of nostalgia, even though D. Whimsey passed away long before you were even born
>His life was cut short due to illness, and seeing him stand on screen so close to his untimely death gives you goose bumps
>He’s a very charismatic man, both in looks and personality
>Trim, cleanly shaven except for a well-groomed mustache, and a grin from ear to ear at all times
>{“Greetings, friends!”}, the distorted audio plays. {“Darwin Whimsey here again for another update on Whimsey Park!”}
>According to what you’ve heard about him, this was the final video he ever shot
>You can see the picture of him and Chobbo right over his shoulder
>D. Whimsey Jr. is playing with some toys on the floor next to his father
>The kid probably has grandchildren of his own by now
>{“We still have a long way to go together, but our journey has been nothing short of fantastical!”}
>A lot of the film is just business talk and projected goals
>And yet, the man talks as though he’s fully aware it’ll reach his fans someday
>You have to admit, just listening to his voice alone is something you could do all day
>Chee silently recites every word in the film with misty eyes
>You expect Rox to be bored out of her mind, but even as she sits slumped back in her chair you can see her brow arch with...melancholy?
>She hasn’t made a noise this whole time
>Even the film goes quiet for a moment as Whimsey gives his closing thoughts
>His face is somber
>Does he know what his fate is soon to be?
>{“We’re all deserving of happiness. Every last one of us. There is no emotion we should have to hide from one another. Make each day magical; not just for yourself, but everyone around you as well. This is Darwin Whimsey, wishing you...all the best.”}
>He knees down to give his son a pat on the back as the film fades to black
>Chee gives feathery applause and wipes a tear away with her wing
>Rox just hangs her head
>Right before the lights come back on, you can briefly see a flash of orange exit the room

>The clearance shop is easily Chee’s most anticipated part of the day
>Discount shirts, stuffed toys, kitchenware, trinkets, anniversary memorabilia...
>Anything discontinued or surplus is available for employees to buy
>Though even with such a markdown it can’t be cheap to hoard as much of the stuff as Chee does
>Rox clearly knows this as well
>”Don’t you have enough of this crap?” she says, shaking her head
>”They just found a case of Halloween stuff from two years ago!” the bird says ecstatically
>She grabs a little black werewolf plush toy and waggles it front of Rox’s face
>”Isn’t she cute? Kind of reminds me of a certain roommate...”
>Chee bops the toy on Rox’s snout and pulls it to her chest before the wolfess can swipe it away
>”I’m going to name her Wolfa, and she’s going right next to the limited edition Trick-or Treat baskets!”
>Even with Chee being the more responsible of the two, her financial priorities are almost as bad
>Not much really interests you, though Rox ends up walking away with one of the hundreds of overprinted shirts stacked to the ceiling in the corner
>Even for a wolfess of her size, it’s still too large for her body
>”Guess I could always use another sleep shirt,” Rox shrugs
>Both of you have to carry Chee’s purchases back to her car
>Not quite done with the Whimsey overload, Chee has their radio station playing as the three of you head back to the apartment
>Her car, her tunes
>Surprisingly, Rox doesn’t object
>She doesn’t even say anything until Chee stops singing
>”Oh!” the bird says. “We should do waffles for dinner tonight!”
>”You can’t be serious,” Rox laughs in disbelief
>”But I want to use my new Princess Glacika waffle iron...”
>”You can wait ‘til morning. Anon and I are going to need some breakfast before we go in for work anyway.”
>”Okay...”
>”Hey, by the way, did you find...THAT picture yesterday?”
>Chee flinches
>”Y-yeah! Right under my uniform in my locker where I left it! I got rid of it, don’t worry!”
>The rest of the car ride is silent

>No waffles for dinner, but at least Chee gets to use her Whimsey Christmas spatula to serve lasagna
>She’s certainly the best chef of the three of you
>Overall she has very motherly traits, making you all the more worried for her and her naivety
>After the meal, Chee begins to get ready for bed already
>You half expect it’s so she can wake up extra early to start making breakfast
>If only you had the drive to wake up looking forward to using a waffle iron
>When the oriole is tucked away for the night, Rox beckons you to her room
>She’s wearing the Whimsey shirt she bought today
>You could practically fit yourself inside that thing along with her
>Your heart skips a beat at the thought
>”Do you wanna come in?” Rox whispers to you
>Into her room?
>At last?
>Guess you two really are a couple now
>It’s pretty spartan due to her tight budget, but it still has Rox’s identity all over it
>A few crooked posters
>A bed that looks hastily made
>A thick joke book being used as a drink coaster
>There’s not a shred of Whimsey evidence inside with the exception of the shirt
>That is, until she opens one of her dresser drawers
>”I was wondering if you wanted to watch a movie with me tonight. If you’re cool with it, I mean.”
>Sounds good to you
>”Just...don’t judge, alright?”
>She has to dig deep into the drawer to find what she needs
>You catch a glimpse of the DVD case just as she pops in the disk
>[Heir of Dog], digitally remastered
>It’s the best example of a G-rated flick you can think of
>No violence, no terror, not even much of an antagonist
>It’s probably the most innocent, kiddish movie in the whole Whimsey line
>It’s also one of the oldest ones, said to be the personal favorite of D. Whimsey himself
>Rox looks at you expecting rejection
>But you’d watch anything with her
>”H-ha, thanks, Anon. Just let me know if you want to stop.”
>She sits back on her bed and pats the spot between her legs
>The Whimsey shirt is so large you can’t tell what (if anything) she has under it
>And yet, Rox doesn’t seem to be sending you THOSE kinds of messages
>You place yourself against her lap, and the wolfess wraps her arms over your chest
>Her shirt flattens out against your back and you can feel the swell of her chest as she inhales
>Her legs are marginally longer than yours, and when she pulls them in they fold over your own
>Her muzzle extends past your face as she rests her head on your shoulder
>You can feel the fluff of her neck tickle your ear
>You’re wearing her as a full-body fur coat
>Toasty and soft
>She can’t help but nuzzle your face and rub her paws on your chest
>In the back, you can faintly hear the sound of her tail swishing over the bed sheets
>All this is going on before the opening credits are even finished
>90 minutes of this?
>Perfect
>You start to wonder if there’s a sequel you could watch, too...
>You’ve seen this movie before, and you’re not exactly worried about what’s going on
>This isn’t a movie night so much as an excuse to cuddle
>Rox seems to agree, though she still stares at the TV with rapt attention
>Does she love the movie that much, or is she trying to see your reflection in the screen?
>Maybe a little of both
>If it’s the only Whimsey movie she owns, and she kept it hidden from her roommate, it must mean something to her
>She knows all the songs by heart and hums along to them
>Rocking you gently side to side
>You can feel the reverberation of her lungs through your body
>Whenever there’s no song, she embraces you even tighter
>You try to move your arms, but she has them pinned to your sides
>”Not tonight,” she chuckles. “You keep those hands where I can see them.”
>Rox lifts her head off your shoulder and nibbles at your ear
>She plants a quick kiss on your cheek, then resumes leaning on you
>She doesn’t play fair
>You’re still locked in the hug long after the movie ends
>The wolfess breathes deeply a few times to savor the moment
>Everything’s peaceful
>Rox’s paws continue rubbing your chest for a while, then move on to your neck and head
>You want to face her and share the compassion, but she’s the one in control now
>”It’s getting late,” she says tiredly, “and your couch is too far away.”
>She scoots forward with you still on her lap just far enough to lay back with her head on the pillows
>Still clinging on with one arm, she reaches to the lights and shuts them off
>You’re nestled completely inside of her
>She wasn’t able to pull the sheets over you, but you don’t need them
>Her body heat is enough to soothe you into a peaceful rest
>”Anon...” she murmurs
>When you respond, she only sighs
>A happy sigh
>”Anon....”
>She gives you one last lick on the cheek
>”I...goodnight....”
>To make up for an uncomfortable night of sleep, she gives you one of the best you can ever remember
>You can only hope you never have to sleep on the couch again
>Unless it’s with her, right next to you



[[ CHAPTER 8: Rox Fall, Everyone Cries ]]

>As expected, the smell of waffles greets you and Rox when you wake up
>You’re still wrapped up in her arms
>When you stir to get up you’re grappled even tighter
>”Not yet,” she yawns. “Let her wake us up.”
>Rox doesn’t have a stellar record of being on time, and now you’re going to be cutting things too closely more often
>You want to be responsible about your job, but you also want hugs from your wolfess
>You split the difference and make at least ONE attempt to get her out of bed
>She turns your head closer to her muzzle and gives you a few solid licks over your face
>”There, you’re clean. Now can we just have five more minutes?”
>You’re not even allowed to answer
>Rox puts her paw to your mouth to muffle any objection
>Whether it’s been five minutes or not, the time sails by
>”Roxie? Anon?”
>Oh, crap
>Chee must know by now you’ve spent the whole night in Rox’s room
>The bird probably isn’t going to think much of it, but then again that’s the problem
>She left a picture of “the kiss” for you and Rox each, and even counting the one she “got rid of” there’s still one more hidden in her room somewhere
>Chee definitely seems to take joy in seeing Rox and you as a couple
>And if anyone’s going to get you two in trouble for it, wittingly or not, it might be the oriole
>”Roxieee, you guys are gonna be late!”
>”Ugghh, ALRIGHT Chee, we’re coming.”
>You’re practically lifted off the bed under Rox’s arm like a stuffed toy
>The two of you trudge to the kitchen, where a hearty stack of waffles is built up
>Each one is stamped with an image of “Princess Glacika”, albeit looking a little...deformed
>Guess you know why the waffle irons were so heavily discounted
>”So, what are you up to today?” Rox says to the bird through a mouthful of food
>You get the impression the wolfess isn’t all that interested in the answer, but is trying to facilitate conversation to be a good roommate
>You kind of understand why the wolfess would hesitate
>”Hmm, well, I need to run a few errands around the mall, and I should probably hit the bank before I do that. I promised Petch I’d swing by her place for a little while, but I want to come back here and clean up the place a bit, and....”
>This goes on for some time
>”Alright, Chee. Gotta go!” Rox yells over the bird’s rambling
>”Have a good day, you two! Stay out of trouble!”
>”Thanks, mom.”
>Rox is still picking the sleep out of her eyes as the two of you drive off to work
>”Boy, I’m already looking forward to having a nap,” Rox groans
>Didn’t she sleep all right?
>”Like a baby,” she says. “That’s the problem. Now you got me addicted to scratches AND cuddles, ya’ jerk.”
>You get a firm punch to the shoulder
>”Nah, I’m always like this at the start of the week,” she continues. “You just never see it because I...well....”
>She laughs in embarrassment
>”I’m always looking forward to working with you, Anon, even if it’s in some ratty old costume. Now you get to see all the ugly parts of me whenever we weren’t around each other.”
>You can’t imagine considering ANY part of Rox ugly
>”You’re a real sweet guy, you know that?”
>When the car rolls into the parking lot, Rox locks the doors before you can grab the handle
>She puts an arm around your shoulder and pulls you in
>Her eyes are closed as your cheeks mash together
>This is how you get late for work
>”Just five more minutes,” she mumbles

>You dress into your handler’s attire
>Another day, another shift with the eyes of the wolfess always on you
>The anxiety of being hidden away among the anthros is almost completely gone at this point
>Any hurdles in getting used to their society seem unintimidating, especially with Rox at your back
>And whenever you’re allowed fully access to the anthro world, you’re sure things will never go south again
>It’s just a matter of getting a hold of D. Whimsey Jr.
>Only the biggest name in the company right now
>So no pressure
>When you meet up with Rox in her usually preparation spot, she’s completely out of costume
>Something’s not right
>”They wouldn’t let me change,” she says. “Apparently I got to go see Sherry-K first. We both do.”
>No costume AND no witty nickname for the coordinator?
>Even Rox must know something’s wrong
>You feel like you’re walking to the principal’s office with your partner-in-crime
>Neither one of you wants to make a joke about it
>The two of you file into the tigress’ office, where she’s waiting with her usual slab of wood
>”Anon. Roksa.”
>”Yeah?” is all Rox says
>Sherry-K taps away on the clipboard
>Is she trying to find the right words?
>No, she doesn’t seem like the type to ever have to rehearse a speech, or a lecture
>This must be really, really bad
>The tigress turns to you
>You’ve grown accustomed to the frigid indoor temperatures of the backstage buildings, cooled to offset the sweltering heat outside
>But you’ll always have a chill run up your spine from her piercing eyes
>”I’ve already spoken to BOTH of you about a certain rule regarding workplace dating, but I’m disappointed in how soon YOU disregarded my warnings, Anon.”
>Your stomach knots
>It’s clear what’s coming next
>Sherry-K peels a photo off of her clipboard
>You don’t even need to see it
>But that tigress is going to make sure you do
>”Can either of you tell me what I’m looking at here?” she says
>”Well, not much. You’re holding it backwards.”
>Dammit, Rox...
>The tigress’ nostrils flare up
>”This is NO joke, Roksa! I’d ask you if you realize just how severe this is, but I know I’ve never gotten a good answer out of you yet!”
>The wolfess’ lip curls up
>Her teeth are bared
>”So what? That was at Cast Night. Big fucking deal. We were off the clock!”
>Sherry-K’s claws puncture the picture in neat little holes
>”EVEN SO,” the tigress says. “This picture could have wound up in the hands of a human guest! We take care to clean up after ourselves following every Cast Night, but we can’t clean up reckless stupidity!”
>”It could have, but it didn’t,” the wolfess seethes. “So I think you can get off our backs already!”
>”And I think it’s time we separated the two of you!” Sherry-K growls
>Rox looks as though she were given the death penalty
>Her mouth gapes, struggling to find the words to argue with
>”It’s clear you are a poor influence on Anon,” Sherry-K resumes. “He has shown remarkable acclimation to our systems in spite of his predicament, and if we are to allow him to set a good example for the rest of humans, we need to remove the elements that—“
>”Bullshit!” Rox says at long last
>It’s a race between you and the tigress to see whose eyes can get the biggest
>The wolfess points her claw at the coordinator
>”You just want to see people miserable! That’s all you EVER do! You never believed in Anon like I did; you’re just looking for an excuse to drive us apart, because you’re just a miserable BITCH!”
>And snap goes the clipboard
>You want to run
>You want to grab something to defend yourself with
>You want to shield Rox from whatever is going to be hurled her way
>Sherry-K’s eyes slit to the point of being nonexistent
>”ROKSA!” the tigress roars. “You are SUSPENDED from work immediately, and you are BANNED from this park until further notice!”
>Rox’s ears fold back
>She knows how terribly she screwed up this time
>She also knows it’s not over yet
>”You will remain suspended until I have a talk with management,” the tigress shakes
>Her words are softer, more enunciated
>This feels tenfold worse than her yelling
>“And once we let you back on the park grounds, it’ll be to discuss your future here with this company. Now get OUT and go HOME!”
>Rox gives you one last look of shame before turning to leave
>It’s a look that’s full of apology, possibly even more sincere than the last time she had to make it up to you
>She drags herself out of the office
>Leaving you alone with the tigress
>You’re afraid to look at her, but she’s waiting patiently until you do
>”I’m no liar, Anon,” she says when you work up the courage to face her
>”After you were dumped into our hands by that idiot wolf, I genuinely thought I could make you into a use for our company. I will give you one...last...chance.”
>She marches over to the supplies cabinet and takes out three more clipboards
>She stacks them together, trying to fortify them for her anger
>”You will continue to report to me at the beginning and end to every shift, or another coordinator if I’m not available. I’ll arrange for someone to pick you up and drop you off at your apartment accordingly. You will miss NO days of work, understand?”
>She scrawls something on her papers in fury as she talks
>”Your vehicle privileges will be once again revoked during your probation, but I will allow you to remain at your current residence along with Chee.”
>Along with Chee?
>The way she words that is discomforting
>”Once we resolve the issue with Roksa, we will reevaluate your circumstances. Now, please report to your assigned handler post.”
>You don’t see Rox anywhere when you leave the office

>The Whirly Barf is piloted by someone different this time
>For the first time in what feels like forever
>You wonder whether it’s a human or an anthro, but it’s quickly revealed to be the latter
>”Hey, uh, sorry to hear what, uh, happened.”
>Baggy, you think
>You haven’t been his handler for a while
>After all, Rox has pretty much been inseparable from you right from the beginning
>You’ve only ever had two others besides her, and you can’t even remember who the third was
>You’re pretty sure Baggy’s just a nickname
>Then again, most of the anthros seem to have unusual names
>When the two of you take a breather in a chill room, he removes his mask
>It’s a black panther
>He can’t quite look you in the eyes
>Maybe out of fear of “the human”?
>After all, you’re likely a bad omen in their eyes right now
>Your shift is brutally long once you get back out there
>Neither you nor Baggy really put in the same kind of energy as you and Rox did
>Every last minute is agonizing without her
>When the punishment finally comes to an end you’re called back to Sherry-K’s office
>She doesn’t have many words from you except from a curt, “Good job today.”
>After you change back out of your uniform, you meet up with a familiar hippo coordinator to take you back to your apartment
>He’s just as stoic as he was the day he bounced you into the tigress’ office the first time
>But when you reach the apartment, he finally speaks
>It’s actually kind of squeaky and higher pitched than you were expecting from someone of his size
>”Just let me know if you ever need to talk. To her.”
>You nod politely, not entirely sure what he means or why you’d ever want to do what you think he means

>You can hear the wailing before you even open the door
>Though surprisingly, it’s not from Rox
>It’s from Chee
>The wolfess has her arm around the bird, sitting in the middle of a floor of tissues
>Rox still looks pretty torn up about it herself, but the oriole is the one taking the news the hardest
>From the looks of things, she’s been crying for hours
>”Chee, c’mon,” Rox says
>You can’t miss the break in her voice
>”I haven’t been fired yet, don’t worry.”
>The bird shakes her head violently
>”I-I-it’s all my fault!” she sobs. “It’s all my fault!”
>You think Chee’s just being hard on herself again
>After all, she didn’t know Sherry-K would find the photo
>Right?
>She said she knew where it was, and got rid of it
>Right?
>Your heart sinks
>The wolfess looks at your mournfully
>The girls are on the couch with you just standing there for at least an hour
>Nobody eats anything for dinner
>Rox has to lead her roommate to her own bed and tuck her in
>You can still hear the hiccups and the sniffles of the oriole through the door
>The wolfess looks to the battlefield of discarded tissues and brushes a few aside
>”I might be the one on the couch tonight, h-ha,” she says hoarsely
>You walk her to her room anyway
>If she’ll let you, you’d like to spend the night together
>She just nods
>You guide Rox to the bed and ease her down
>She’s in a fetal position until you lower yourself to her
>The wind is squeezed out of you as she pulls you into a death grip
>Your whole body is once again encased by fur
>Only this time, it’s not with the gentle lull of her slow breathing, but pitiful trembles
>You can feel the wetness of her nose bleed through your shirt
>”I’m sorry,” she sobs
>You want to free your arms to console her
>She won’t let go
>Between the pain of her constriction and the heaviness of the day, you know it’ll be a poor night’s rest
>But before you’re finally afforded a small bit of rest, a thought passes through your mind
>Something the hippo said
>About talking with Sherry-K
>You wince, and not just from the wolfess’ hug
>If you’re going to help Rox this time, you’re going to have to do something really stupid



[[ CHAPTER 9: Solid as a Rox ]]

>As expected, not a good night
>You wake up in the vice of the wolfess
>There’s a pained frown on her face; her dreams are plagued with regret
>Why, Rox?
>She’s always been brash to a fault, even when under a costume mask
>But this is the first time you have ever seen her explode like that
>Was it the fear of separation?
>Just the thought of being away from you made her snap?
>She’s certainly hanging on to you like she never wants to be apart ever again
>There’s a rapping at the bedroom door from Chee’s beak
>”Roxie?”
>The bird still looks distraught about yesterday
>”Roxie, you need to let Anon go to work.”
>The wolfess must hear her, because the grip on you tightens
>”Roxie....”
>The wolfess opens her eyes, full of sorrow
>”Yeah...alright...” she croaks
>Reluctantly, she lets you go
>”Do you want some breakfast?” Chee says
>”No...I’m just going to sleep some more, thanks.”
>Getting ready is especially a chore today
>Chee offers to drive you, but you tell her the circumstances of your probation
>This sets her off again
>She wraps you up in her wings and sobs into your chest
>”I-it’s all my fault.”
>You tell her it isn’t
>”Y-yes it is....”
>You pat her on the pat
>Out of morbid curiosity, you ask her why she thinks that
>The bird only shakes her head
>You manage to pry her off when your ride shows up
>It’s the hippo again
>Seems he’s the muscle when he needs to be and the chauffeur anytime else
>No good mornings from him
>It feels like a prison escort on the way to the park grounds
>Before he drops you off, you bring up what he said yesterday
>He doesn’t respond, just waiting for a definitive answer from you
>It’s going to take a few deep breaths for this one
>You tell the hippo you plan on talking with the tigress
>”Sherry-K isn’t working today,” he says
>Now comes the stupid part
>You ask him if there’s any way you can meet her anyway
>Even if it means going to her own house
>The hippo looks genuinely afraid for you
>”She lives in the coordinator complex. I can drop you off there later, but you’re going to be on your own to find a way back. I’m not hanging around for her to find out I did this for you.”
>It’ll have to do
>You don’t think you’ll be able to stand seeing Rox so broken up for one more day
>The hippo gives you a sympathetic look
>”Alright. I hope you know what you’re doing.”

>The second day of being Baggy’s handler isn’t any better
>He doesn’t hover too close to you while he performs
>Whenever there are no guests around, he keeps his gaze locked on you
>It’s a little creepy with that mascot mask’s unblinking eyes
>Now it seems the gossip has fully spread throughout the anthros
>So instead of just fearfulness of what you could have done to get Rox suspended, they’re all flat out terrified of you
>You sit alone for lunch, though every eye watches you eat
>The only who who’s even the least bit subdued about the whole thing is the replacement coordinator
>An older goat checks you in and out for your shift
>He’s no Sherry-K, that’s for sure
>Though you’re still afraid with his old age he might have some pretty frightening tenure with the company
>What he lacks in presence he makes up for in experience
>The strangest part is he doesn’t even have the slightest bit of concern he’s dealing with a human
>You’re treated with the same nonchalance as any delinquent would, if an authority figure had to spend years of putting up with troublemakers like you
>You can handle his attitude, but his speed grates on you
>The hippo is waiting for you, as is the tigress, but the goat is taking his sweet time writing up the report on you for the day
>FINALLY he lets you free, and you race to where your driver is parked
>No talk is shared between the two of you
>He just gives you a look as though reminding you there’s still time to back out
>But waiting even a single day more could risk Rox’s employment
>With a nod of confirmation, the two of you head off to the coordinator complex

>It’s much more than a job position, it seems
>Being a coordinator must net you a few nice perks
>Getting your own place is one of them
>The coordinator complex isn’t as spread out as the rest of the employee lodgings, but each unit has the space to house a single resident comfortably
>Having that sort of extra privacy must be nice option
>But you’ve grown to appreciate the company of Rox and Chee
>The hippo drops you off near the door to Sherry-K’s in the late evening
>He gives it a quick point and then speeds off
>There’s no turning back now
>You could try, but something tells you if you tried to leave now without resolving anything it could be even worse for you
>Who knows what kind of surveillance this part of the park has?
>You knock on the door
>Nothing
>You try again
>Nothing
>Each knock takes a little more confidence from you, and now you’re just standing there in silence
>You don’t even have it in you to look at the eyehole
>When the door finally unlocks, your heart leaps
>Sherry-K stands in the doorway, fully clothed in her pinstripe coordinator’s outfit
>”Anon?”
>You’ve fucked up, you know it
>What can you even say to her at this point?
>There was no appointment, no invitation
>You just showed up at her doorstep with no real plan except to beg for Rox to be unsuspended
>That’s all you have to go on right now
>So you tell her as much
>Her grassy eyes peel you apart
>Wait
>Speaking of peeling apart, why IS she in her coordinator’s outfit?
>When you explain yourself to the tigress, you word your explanation in a way that lets her know you wanted to try and find her at work today
>Your glances at her uniform tip her off to your inquiry
>”If you must know, I’m often ‘on call’ in the off chance I’m needed for emergencies in the park.”
>Something about the way she says it doesn’t sound sincere
>The tigress looks around outside, trying to find where you came from
>You can already tell she’s not happy about figuring out how to send you away
>But she doesn’t, to your enormous surprise
>”Hmph. Would you like to...come in?”
>She speaks like how you feel
>Unsure
>It’s a good thing you don’t have a tail, because she slams the door shut as soon as you’re fully inside her place
>Holy
>Shit
>And you thought CHEE was obsessed....
>Every square inch of Sherry-K’s home is adorned with Whimsey
>Knickknacks, paintings, and curtains
>Kitchenware, upholstery, and even the carpet pattern
>There’s a quiet ambience of Whimsey music not unlike what plays on endless loop throughout the park
>Not even a Whimsey gift shop looks this chock-the full of stuff
>”It’s all from employee discounts. It’s just...cheaper to furnish the place this way.”
>Yeah, where have you heard THAT before?
>The tigress flattens out her uniform and motions to the couch
>”Please, have a seat and we’ll discuss the matter further.”
>You sit down and the couch rings out
>Did it just play a jingle?
>Where would you even get a singing couch?
>”Would you like anything to drink?” she says from the kitchen
>It would probably be better not to refuse her offer rather than fear she might poison you
>Either way, you’re not in a good place
>You take a peek over at her while she prepares the beverages
>There’s a bottle already on the counter, noticeably empty already
>Sherry-K joins you on the couch, giving an uncomfortably short amount of space between the two of you
>”So,” she says after a few sips, “about Roksa....”
>You plead with the tigress to show some leniency to the wolfess
>”Roksa has been given countless opportunities to better herself, and—“
>You tell her Rox has already tried to turn herself around, and has shown the effort to be a better performer as a result
>”Yes, I have seen improvement in that particular aspect of her role, however—“
>You tell her you could take part of the blame, if it means lessening the harshness of Rox’s punishment
>”That’s a noble thought, but the guidelines for disciplinary action—“
>You tell her you can convince Rox to apologize to her, and the two of you will do whatever it takes to make things right
>Sherry-K doesn’t speak for a while, even after you stop interjecting
>Like any meeting with her, it’s the silence that’s the most unnerving
>”Anon,” she says at last. “You are still new to this company, even ignoring your recent ‘inclusion’ to our specific branch. You couldn’t possibly imagine the number of times I’ve had to speak with Roksa about her behavior.”
>Sherry-K stops only to drain the rest of her glass
>”You couldn’t guess the sheer volume of dossiers I’ve had to write. Not just about Roksa, but EVERY employee here.”
>She sets the glass down on the coffee table, but it rattles from an unsteady paw
>”You have no idea the kind of bureaucracy I have to put up with on a day-to-day basis.”
>The tigress sits with her paws folded on her lap and her eyes closed
>”You....”
>Her claws dig into her uniform pants
>She draws in a hasty breath
>Her lip quivers
>”You don’t know what it’s like to be m-me....”
>The proud tigress breaks into tears
>You seem to have a penchant for being around crying women
>It might be grossly out of line, but you put your hand on Sherry-K’s shoulder for support
>Bad idea
>She immediately topples over like a massive tree and slams her head onto your lap
>Paws over eyes, she weeps uncontrollably
>There’s not much you can do but gently stroke her head
>”M-management harasses me all the time not to make mistakes,” she chokes. “But when I try to do a good job I make everyone else miserable!”
>Her legs bunch up as though she’s trying to fit her whole body on the safety of your lap
>”Everyone h-hates me, Anon!”
>You can only let her ride it out
>Fortunately, there’s a Whimsey tissue dispenser just within reach
>Like the couch, it makes a little jingle when you tug a tissue out
>She snatches it from your hand and blows her wide nose
>Sitting beside the dispenser is a family photo
>A mother and father tiger with a small kitten in the middle
>The little girl beams with wonderment in her eyes
>They’re all standing with a familiar Whimsey castle as the nighttime backdrop
>Probably during a Cast Night, because they’re the only ones enjoying the frame space
>”Getting this job was a dream come true,” Sherry-K says when she calms down
>Long after the sobbing stops, she keeps her head on you
>”I just wanted to make people happy. I wanted to rise through the ranks so I could start making judgment calls and p-pitching all the ideas I had. But it can get awful, Anon.”
>Her tail wraps around and she begins picking at the tip hairs
>”One of the few friends I had starting out was a bunny girl. She was a head coordinator, and one of the sweetest people I’ve known. The job...they ate her alive, Anon.”
>Oh...god...
>”N-not literally!” she cries. “She quit! She couldn’t take it. Why would anyone do this to themselves? Why would anyone want to pull back the curtain and see all the ugliness behind it?”
>There have been times you’ve asked yourself the same thing
>Even before learning about the anthros, there was bitterness to working a theme park you wish everyone could know about
>So many angry, impatient guests who had no clue how unpleasant things could get
>But you’ve never been the one who has to manage everything
>When an employee screws up, it’s the coordinators who hear about it
>It’s them who have to set things right
>That’s a horrible responsibility, and something you wouldn’t wish on anyone
>”I just wanted to help Roksa,” Sherry-K says suddenly
>...What?
>”It’s true,” she hiccups. “You’re so lucky, Anon. I wish I could be in your shoes. I’ve always thought she was a...beautiful wolf.”
>Wow
>Guess Rox was right about the tigress
>”She’s the only one who really challenges me, who stands up to me. I...I love that. But by the time I got to see that part of her I could tell it’s because she already hated me. Every time I gave her a reprimand I hoped she would turn herself around and not get fired. I bent so many rules just so she wouldn’t....”
>Yeah, that sounds like Rox
>But maybe this could be a breakthrough
>You tell Sherry-K that if Rox knew what she had to go through to keep her from getting canned, maybe the wolfess would rein it in a bit
>”No! I could never do that! She’d just laugh at me, and the rest would trample over me....”
>You tell the tigress both of you know Rox better than that
>The wolfess may not be the most social butterfly of the employees, but nobody messes with her either
>If Sherry-K could confide in her, and the two became “friends”, nobody would dare take advantage of the tigress
>And in your mind, you’re already thinking a few steps ahead
>If Sherry-K’s clout is on your side, could she really help the two of you meet with D. Whimsey Jr.?
>”Can you really get her to listen to me?” Sherry-K says
>You can do what you can
>Rox needs her job back, but she also needs to give yet another apology
>It would be the perfect time to reconcile with the both of them
>”A-alright...alright,” she sniffs. “Please let...Rox...know I would like to speak with her. Tomorrow. Just promise me you won’t tell her about what a wreck I was.”
>You pat the tigress in reassurance
>”Thank you.”
>She sits up and composes herself
>You can faintly see a Whimsey t-shirt underneath her rumpled coordinator’s uniform
>”Now then, I assume you’ll be needing to be taken back to your apartment? I don’t doubt your ride here hasn’t gotten very far yet.”
>Oh boy, now the hippo’s in trouble
>”As long as everyone keeps tonight confidential for now, nobody will be in trouble,” Sherry-K promises
>The hippo returns several minutes later, looking rather timid to be so close to his boss again
>But by then Sherry-K has already dismissed you from her home
>When you hop into the vehicle you give the hippo the A-okay
>Mission accomplished?
>Well, you’ll have to see what lies in store for you tomorrow
>At the very least, you can’t wait to let Rox and Chee know thing’s look like they’re going to get better
>And maybe they’ll stop getting you into more trouble than you deserve
>...
>Not likely



[[ CHAPTER 10: Rox Candy ]]

>The trip back to the apartment seems like hours
>This wasn’t a life-or-death matter, but it sure felt like it for a moment
>When you throw open the door you see your two roommates sitting together on the couch
>Both were looking sullen and teary-eyed, but they leap to their feet at the sight of you
>Rox and Chee rush over, as if expecting to see something wrong with you
>Or expecting to never see you again
>”We thought you were sent away!” Chee cries
>”Don’t do that to us, man,” Rox sniffs
>”At least call us first!”
>Wow, what a welcome home that was
>”So...why so late?” Rox says
>You lead the girls back to the couch and explain just about everything
>Starting with how you begged Sherry-K to unsuspend Rox
>She was open to the idea, provided she gets a chance to speak with the wolfess
>And gets an apology
>You hint at how frustrated the tigress is at management as well, but leave out the part where she was bawling in your lap
>Sherry-K essentially wants to bury the hatchet with Rox
>Chee looks to the wolfess expectantly
>”You did all that for me?” Rox grimaces
>That’s what roommates do, after all
>There’s no guarantee things are going to work out exactly how you all want, but at least this is a promising start
>The bird flaps her wings excitedly while the wolfess rubs her neck
>”That means a lot to me,” Rox says. “Thanks, Anon.”
>She gives you a subtle nod over to her room with a smirk, but soon flares her nostrils
>”Ehh, I’m going to need a shower after moping like a sad sack all day. Don’t go anywhere, you two.”
>Rox heads into the bathroom while you and Chee chill out by the couch again
>As soon as the water starts, Chee looks extremely bothered by something
>”Did...Sherry-K say anything about me?”
>Not really
>Chee’s name didn’t even come up once, as far as you remember
>She looks like she’s on the verge of tears again
>”Anon, I...I have to confess something. Pleasedontbemad!”
>Yikes
>Something’s got her worked up
>You promise not to be mad, whatever it is
>The oriole’s chest puffs out as she takes a huge breath
>”That day we first met, at the bar, Sherry-K pulled me aside when we were figuring out what to do with you. She...she asked me to keep an eye on you, a-and report what I saw to her.”
>Oh...Chee...
>”I didn’t know what to tell her at the time! She’d ask about you and Rox, and I told her the two of you were really close friends!”
>Probably why she was so up in your face about “workplace dating”...
>”A-and then after Cast Night, I dropped one of the pictures I took of you two on the ride. She...she was right there! She took it, and....”
>It’s hard to tell if the shower or Chee’s eyes are letting out more water
>”It really IS all my fault!” she wails
>”Something wrong?” you can hear Rox call out from the bathroom
>You yell back to Rox that everything’s fine
>Chee is clamping her beak shut
>So, Sherry-K had an informant in your very apartment
>Of course Chee would have been too scared to challenge the tigress
>Still, Sherry-K had every opportunity to confront you two about the photo during the weekend
>Especially in the Cast Complex theater, where you’re positive she was lurking around the corner
>Was it jealousy she was suppressing?
>And that the concern over humans finding the photo was just an excuse to reprimand you?
>Whatever the case, what’s done is done
>It’s too soon to say whether the damage is irreparable
>All you know is now you have to calm a sobbing bird sitting beside you
>You pull her in for a hug, and she wraps you up in her wings
>Her feathers are incredibly soft, like heavenly downy
>You tell her this might have worked out in your favor after all
>”R-really? How?”
>If Rox and Sherry-K didn’t have a reason for speaking to one another like they’re going to do, they might never have swallowed their pride and tried to make amends
>In a way, this helped jumpstart the healing process for both of them
>”It doesn’t feel like I helped much...” she hiccups
>You give the bird a pat on the back
>Nobody lost their job yet, so the best you can do is consider this a victory for now
>Chee gives you a hopeful smile
>”Thanks, Anon. You’ve been a great friend. I’m glad Rox dragged you into all this.”
>That’s one way to put it...
>Speaking of the wolfess, she exits the bathroom several minutes later
>Her clean fur might actually look even softer than Chee’s feathers
>”Well, I guess we’d better call it a night,” Rox says
>”Already? But you slept all day!” Chee laughs
>”Well, yeah, but that’s different. Besides, if we’re going to have to have a chitchat with our favorite coordinator tomorrow we might as well get there early.”
>”You? Up early?”
>”Don’t think I won’t find those pins, Chee.”
>”Eep! G-goodnight everyone!”
>The bird dashes into her room and shuts the door
>You’re hoisted to your feet by the wolfess and led to her own room
>”I owe you one, Anon. You’re really saving my hide here. I know I got you into this mess in the first place, and you never had to stick up for me like that.”
>Well, you couldn’t exactly run away from all this anyway
>”Is there anything I could do to pay you back?”
>You could probably think of a few ways
>But for tonight, it might be best to bank that favor and instead help Rox relax
>She’s likely been worrying about your future together nonstop ever since yesterday
>”C’mon. You have me over a barrel here, and I don’t like being in debt. Now, are you going to let me repay you, or are—OOOooohhh....”
>You disarm her with ear scratches
>”No...no, let me make you feel goo~oooaaahhh....”
>Guess her chin works just as well
>The wolfess melts into the sheets with bliss
>You incapacitate her, then bundle her up with the covers
>She sticks her tongue out as you continue to scratch and rub her head
>Rox manages to fight through the ecstasy long enough to roll on top of you
>You’re pinned down by her large body and a tired huff
>”Fine,” she yawns. “We’ll save it for another night.”
>You might have missed a great opportunity there
>Then again, it’s something you’d rather wait to cap off a day filled with joy with, and not one with tears
>You fall asleep with the wolfess resting heavily on top of you

>True to her word, Rox makes an effort to get up early
>An effort
>But Chee still has to literally drag Rox out of bed, and the wolfess pulls you along with her
>”Roxieee,” Chee moans. “You’re not going to be allowed to work again if you don’t talk to Sherry-K!”
>Rox mumbles something into your back
>She finally gets up after the two of you hit the floor
>Chee already has leftover waffles from the freezer ready to go, pecking at them with proper etiquette while Rox scarfs her stack down
>The bird takes her own car while you ride with Rox
>”You’re going to have to be my conscience, bud,” she says. “Don’t let me say anything that’ll get me in trouble again.”
>Yeah, like you could stop her from doing that
>It’s a tense day as you head in to the anthros’ side of the park
>Chee catches up with you and Rox, and the three of you make your way to the coordinators’ office
>Sherry-K is waiting patiently, hugging a clipboard
>Nobody says anything for an uncomfortable amount of time
>Rox steps up to the plate first, in her usual way
>”So, you wanted to see me?”
>Off to a good start
>”I did, yes,” the tigress responds
>It’s clear she’s waiting for something
>You and Chee give Rox the same look
>Backed into a corner, the wolfess sighs
>”Look, I...I want to say I’m sorry for how I acted. You didn’t deserve that, Sher.”
>It’s hard to read the tigress’ thoughts from her blank look
>You expect Rox to think that’s enough of an apology, but she goes on
>”I’d like to come back to work,” she says. “I’ll do whatever you think I need to so I can make up for it.”
>If this were the old Sherry-K, the tigress might have relished seeing her rival grovel before her
>But there’s actually a look of relief in her eyes
>”We might have BOTH overreacted the other day, Roksa. Suspending you may have been too hasty of a punishment. After all, I can’t deny the two of you work better than any pairing we have here.”
>Sherry-K gives you the faintest smile she can muster
>”I only want what’s best for the park,” she continues, “and separating you now would only make things more difficult for everyone involved.”
>”Well, I know it can’t be easy for you, Sher,” Rox says. “Anon told me how badly management’s been riding your ass.”
>Now the smile on the tigress’ face turns to shock
>It’s a “what else did you tell her?” sort of expression
>Dammit, Rox
>”Hey, it’s all cool,” Rox says. “He didn’t need to tell me that. We all know the kind of shit you get put through. It’s just...I guess sometimes we get a little petty and let you take it. But that’s not right.”
>The wolfess walks up to Sherry-K
>The tigress looks taken aback by her approach
>Rox extends a paw
>”We’re on the same team, Sher, and I’d like to start acting like it, too. Can we call a truce?”
>Sherry-K takes her paw, and the two shake on it
>Chee lets out a peep of excitement that startles you a bit
>”I haven’t technically submitted the paperwork for our little altercation yet,” Sherry-K says. “We can put this past us, deal?”
>”You got it!”
>Rox breaks the handshake with a devious grin
>It’s the kind of look that you know all too well by now
>One that worries you immensely
>”You know, I’m pretty flattered, Sher. Didn’t think you really had the hots for me like that.”
>Sherry-K looks at you with a mortified look
>Goddammit, Rox!
>You’re on the verge of chewing Rox out yourself before she steps in
>”Relax, Anon didn’t say anything too personal, Sher. I already knew you were into me.”
>Sherry-K is trying vainly to recompose herself
>”O-oh? Then how did you figure it out?”
>”Well for starters, you just told me.”
>The tigress stammers for a response, but the wolfess moves in closer
>Rox gives you a brief apologetic look
>She leans in and gives Sherry-K a quick kiss on the cheek
>Chee gasps loudly
>The tigress drops her clipboard
>And her professional façade as well
>”Don’t you DARE say anything about ‘workplace dating’,” Rox warns with a smirk
>The tigress reaches up to where she was kissed
>Her paw trembles
>”Look,” Rox says. “Don’t think of it too much, Sher. That was a platonic kiss. I really want us to start being friends after all this, but I’m not really into girls.”
>”O-of course,” Sherry-K says
>”But, listen. If I WERE, you’d probably be my first choice. Honest. You have a lot going for you, missy. You just gotta open up a little more, alright?”
>Sherry-K has a sincere look of happiness on her face
>”I have an eye for that sort of thing,” Rox says. “If relationship issues are bogging you down, I can probably help with that. But, I won’t push it. Just know I’m here for you. We all are.”
>”Yes, well...I don’t know how much I can confide in the rest of the employees,” Sherry-K says
>”Then don’t,” Rox says. “You don’t have to yet. Ease up on the scowls and the strictness a bit if you can, but don’t let them walk over you. Your secrets are safe with me, Sher, and we’d probably both be better off if they think we still piss each other off.”
>Sherry-K nods
>”But do I...would you like me to call you ‘Rox’, then?”
>She looks genuinely bothered by asking that
>As if she doesn’t feel like she’s “earned” the permission to call the wolfess by her casual name
>”Hey, Roksa is fine,” Rox shrugs. “Can’t say I like it as much, but it honestly wouldn’t feel right not hearing it come out of your mouth, Sher.”
>”I see, very well. Now, I suppose it’s time for the three of you to get ready for your shifts.”
>”Hang on, Sher. There’s something I wanted to ask you.”
>Rox isn’t really in a position to be making requests so soon, but she has her mind set on something, for sure
>”Anon’s been doing a great job getting used to our little secret way of life. I think he’s already prepared to see the rest of our world. Outside the park, I mean.”
>Sherry-K clears her throat
>”I see. Well, he’s only been with us for a week now...”
>Man, it really has been just a week, hasn’t it?
>So much as already happened in such a short amount of time
>”Yeah, but this was the plan all along, right? To get connections going with the humans? I think we can trust Anon by now, but I know we’re going to need the ‘okay’ from the big man himself. Can you get us a way to meet him?”
>Sherry-K looks a little nervous
>You’re seeing all kinds of sides to her you didn’t think she actually had
>”I could look into it, I suppose,” the tigress says. “But I can’t make any promises. Even the coordinators have to have a good reason for bothering Mr. D. Whimsey Jr.”
>Rox nods in agreement
>”Whatever you can do for us, Sher. I’d really appreciate it.”
>You, Rox, and Chee celebrate the victory together silently
>Just as you begin to leave, Sherry-K has one more bit of business with the wolfess
>”Roksa, hold on a moment.”
>Now the three of you share concerned looks
>The two of them made up already, right?
>What now?
>”Yeah?” Rox says
>”The day you overheard management’s plan to integrate us with the humans...how much else did you hear?
>”Probably more than I should be admitting,” Rox chuckles weakly
>”Well, then you probably know about the mascot initiative, correct?”
>”Yeah, I have. And...?”
>Rox understands what you and Chee are completely lost about
>She seems to be waiting for a certain answer, yet dreading it at the same time
>”Roksa, I would like to put in a good word for you. To nominate you for the program.”
>”Get the fuck out,” Rox says in disbelief
>”I’m completely serious. You have shown to be one of our most promising performers here in the park, and it would be disingenuous of me to pass you over just because of our past differences. However....”
>There’s a pleading look in Sherry-K’s eyes
>”You have some obstacles in your way, specifically your track record here. Reprimands, attendance issues...you need to get better about these things before they can consider you. I want to see you get the position, I truly do. Please, please work on your work ethic more in the meantime.”
>It sounds like a request Rox has probably heard hundreds of times by now, with varying degrees of anger and disappointment
>However, this time she actually takes it to heart
>”Yeah, sure. I can do that. Thanks, Sher. You coming to the Booze Cruise tomorrow? We can celebrate Anon’s first full week with us!”
>Rox puts her arms around you and Chee
>”I will consider it,” Sherry-K says, picking up her clipboard
>The three of you leave her office and head toward your work areas
>Chee asks what you’re both thinking
>”Roxie, what’s the mascot initiative thing she was talking about?”
>The wolfess grins broadly
>”I’ll tell you two later.”



[[ CHAPTER 11: For Those About to Rox ]]

>You never thought you’d be so happy to be back at work
>Rox can probably say the same thing
>The wolfess is more animated in the costume than you have ever seen before
>It’s an infectious kind of mood
>You can’t help but smile knowing the Rox in the Whirly Barf suit is smiling right back
>It’s one thing to be pardoned from any trouble you’ve gotten into, but Rox seemed incredibly happy with the whole “mascot initiative” thing Sherry-K mentioned
>Whatever it is, you can’t wait to hear about it
>Rox dances with everyone, you included
>She hugs and pats everyone, and you too
>She shows more attention to the guests than she ever has, but she somehow manages to match the same level of attention for you as well
>It’s hard to keep up with her energy
>When break time comes you are eager to hit the chill room
>Rox is panting heavily when she takes off the mask
>But she’s panting with a wide, stupid grin on her face
>”Hah...hah...whew. Gonna sleep good tonight, I can tell you that.”
>She leans into you, bearing her weight down
>”You’re gonna to have to carry me to bed later.”
>Not if this keeps up
>The break is interrupted by the chirping of your radio
>You completely forgot you even had this thing on you
>Rarely do you ever need to use it to report an issue with a guest
>And coordinators aren’t typically allowed to page you when they think you’re out with your mascot partner
>Likely done to remove as much of the reality of park operations from the guests’ eyes as possible
>People want to see their favorite characters dance and play as though they actually live here, not shackled to instructions or paraded around on leashes
>You answer your radio
>It’s Sherry-K
>”Anon, I’m going to need you to change into your casual clothes and take Roksa over to Starlight Summit as soon as you can. The two of you will be doing a ride-along.”
>You and Rox exchange shocked looks
>Mascot ride-alongs are rarely done, despite what promotional material for the park would have you believe
>It’s just not feasible to have characters constantly hopping into the attractions along with the guests, especially during the busy months
>Only on rare occasions does this happen anymore, and it’s usually when the company shoots new advertising videos
>Or some big-name celebrity pays extra to have the character follow them around all day
>Neither you nor Rox has ever gotten the opportunity before
>But needing you to be in your regular clothes?
>You suppose it’s once again part of the illusion
>If you’re really going to be in a video, they wouldn’t want everyone to know you’re a handler
>And if they want you to act like you’re a guest, hopefully you can really sell it
>”What kind of game is she playing now?” Rox groans
>It can’t be bad, whatever it is
>She wouldn’t jeopardize the park to play some kind of trick on you
>Though after last night, you’re not really sure what she’s capable of anymore

>You change out of your uniform as Rox waits outside of the locker rooms, still in the Whirly Barf
>She nudges you as you head toward the Starlight Summit backstage area
>”Seen any weird looking dicks yet?” she laughs
>As tempting as it is to satisfy your curiosity, you make it a habit not to stare at anthros’ junk when you’re changing
>Especially since their eyes are usually on YOU the whole time
>You and Rox exit the anthro side of the employee tunnels and end up in the “human” areas
>Soon you’re within the inner workings of Starlight Summit
>It’s here you run into one of the park cameramen affixing a video recorder to the front of a ride cart stored off to the side of the tracks
>”I guess we’re, uh, going to be shooting you on a few rides today?” he says
>Looks like you were right
>The guy probably doesn’t even know who told him to come do this
>He’s so close to an anthro, yet he’s completely oblivious to her
>A week ago you might have envied his naivety
>Not anymore
>The three of you cut to the front of the queue as the recorder-mounted cart joins the others back at the station
>There’s a line of guests looking at Rox with amusement
>Rox gives several high fives and ruffles a few heads of hair
>The ones who get to squeeze into the spaceship cart with her look elated
>Even though the two of you have to sit in the back, the whole cart is thrilled to have a character ride with them
>It’s pretty heartwarming to see the Whimsey magic when it can actually put some smiles on faces
>Rather than frowns from long lines or exorbitant food prices
>The cameraman takes a few regular snapshots of the riders just before the brakes are disengaged
>Rox puts her arm around you as the cart slowly rolls out of the station
>”Buckle up,” she whispers just loud enough for only you to hear
>You’ve been on Starlight Summit dozens of times before, but this is the one you know you’ll enjoy the most
>Rox pantomimes exaggerated emotions as the cart shoots through a dark, starlit room
>She shows comical fear when the ride starts and waves her paws around wildly as the speed picks up
>She smothers you with her body for “protection”
>Every time one of the guests sneaks a peek at the two of you, they laugh at the performance
>Halfway through you join the shenanigans as well
>The two of you know the ride photo captures by heart
>You make a humorous face right as the light flashes
>Rox runs the character’s sloppy tongue over your head at the same time
>The ride is over before you know it
>You’re trying to figure out a way to make them send you two through again
>Maybe you can suggest the footage wasn’t as good as it could have been?
>But Rox hoists you out of the cart and back onto the station before you get the chance
>She’s committed to her role, and she doesn’t want to take any risks today
>The other riders look pleased with the photos
>Each one picks up a few souvenirs thanks to you and Rox making the trip hilarious
>At least you don’t have to worry about these photos getting into the wrong hands
>Rox has you grappled under her arm as you head backstage
>Then the radio chirps again
>”Anon, take Roksa to Tilt-A-Whirly next.”
>Another ride-along?
>Well, anything to spend more time with Rox
>The guests are even more excited to see her than the last crowd, seeing as this ride is themed after Whirly Barf himself
>Having a character ride his own ride is the perfect setup
>Like before, a cameraman is getting everything ready for you
>As the names suggests, it’s a spinning, tipping thrill ride for a whole disk full of people
>Not one of Rox’s favorites, but she plays up the motion sickness for laughs
>Even her staggering after getting off is overdone
>Though not by much
>You have to corral her into a straight line to keep her from wiping out into a flower garden
>She stops to greet some guests before you move on to the next attraction

>Rumble Rolloff
>Ratty ol' Mansion
>Wizz Parsec’s Blaster Journey
>You end up doing a half-dozen different attractions, taking you well into the evening
>You’re exhausted when you come off of each one, but you get a second wind whenever the radio goes off again
>”Alright, last one,” Sherry-K says. “End of the Ley Line”
>It’ll be a nice one to finish on
>You and Rox head over, and that’s when you realize something
>Ley Line is a two-rider attraction
>Why would the tigress send you both to a ride where no guests can join you?
>The carts are even spaced so far apart it’s not like anyone will be able to see the two of you ahead or behind
>The ride attendant seems to think the same thing
>But she’s not paid to question what the coordinators tell her
>As your cart rolls along, Rox gets clingy again
>It’s a serene ride through fairy forests and spellbinding streets
>Complete eye candy with no harsh twists or turns
>There’s not even a photo op
>You notice the cart doesn’t have a video recorder on it either
>You and Rox are essentially all alone
>Back when you had no clue what she was underneath it all, you sort of imagined her as a living costume
>Just a dead-eyed Whirly Barf with a muffled female voice coming out of it
>But now, everything’s different
>The padded bulk of the costume doesn’t exist anymore
>Her sheer force of presence breaks through any disguise
>You can FEEL the wolfess inside
>You can feel the grip of her strong arm around you
>You can look past the mask to see her golden eyes and playful smirk
>You can imagine her sitting beside you as though she were entirely...nude
>In your mind’s eye, it’s the same wolfess you fall asleep at night with
>It may be the closest you will ever get to riding along with Rox in the daytime
>That’s not going to stop her from savoring this moment with you
>It never has
>”This is easily the best day of work I’ve ever had,” she sighs
>Agreed
>Still, you can’t help but lament how it could have been even better
>Riding next to Rox with the same joy and satisfaction as she showed today, but not having her stuck inside a costume
>When you tell her this, her paw pats you on the chest
>”I...well...I don’t want to get your hopes up or anything, but....”
>She goes silent for a while
>”We’ll talk about it with Chee later, alright?”
>Is it the “mascot initiative” thing?
>Now you want nothing more than to get off of work

>The end of your shift waits for you at the end of the ride
>Sherry-K didn’t technically call the two of you to meet her again, but it feels necessary
>When you reach her office you see several videos playing on a computer monitor
>All the videos from your rides today
>Except for the final one, of course
>Sherry-K regards you with the same stalwart professionalism you’ve always gotten from her
>”I hope today’s change of plans didn’t inconvenience either of you too much.”
>”Hell no,” Rox says. “Riding around on the job? That was a perfect shift!”
>”Yes, well,” the tigress says, clearing her throat, “I wouldn’t expect it too often. Today was a very spur-of-the-moment circumstance.”
>Rox has a sly look on her face
>”Aww, don’t bullshit us, Sher. You did this as a treat for us, didn’t you?”
>Sherry-K is back to her no-nonsense demeanor
>”I suppose you’d be right to an extent. I did this for the sake of you both, but for different reasons than you think. If we are going to nominate you for the mascot initiative, Roksa, then we are going to need ‘audition tapes’ of sorts.”
>The tigress turns to you
>”And for Anon, not only will this help Roksa by showing you are her most qualified handler, but this will also be a good opportunity to make a case for why you should be allowed into our society outside of the park. You’ve shown remarkable acclimation to our ways.”
>”C’mon Sher, you didn’t at all do this because we’re friends now?” Rox says
>”Our talk today only reinforced a decision I’ve come to for a while now. It’s as I said: you are one of our most promising performers. I was fully intending on gathering the proof eventually.”
>”Yeah? And what proof did you get from that last ride? The one with no cameras?”
>Looks like Rox picked up on that, too
>”O-oh? Odd, I clearly instructed the cameraman to meet you there. No matter. Looks like we got enough footage, and you got a free ride out of it.”
>Rox rolls her eyes as the tigress straightens her collar
>”Whatever, Sher. You decide if you’re coming with us to the bar tomorrow?”
>The tigress’ brow furrows
>”I said I will consider it.”
>”Well if you’re waiting for a formal invitation, this is it,” Rox scoffs. “We’d like you to come, but I’m not going to twist your arm.”
>”Fine,” Sherry-K replies, perhaps a little too eagerly. “If that will make you happy.”
>”Hey, I’m not the one working six days a week. You need to relax a bit, girl. I want to see that pinstripe shirt come off you sometime.”
>Sherry-K coughs uncomfortably
>”We’ll get you a few drinks. It’ll be on us,” the wolfess says
>By that she probably means it’ll be on Chee again...
>Sherry-K inhales deeply
>”Your shift is over for the day. You both did a good job. I hope to see this level of performance again.”
>”Yeah, alright. We’ll see you tomorrow, Sher.”
>Sherry-K very obviously scribbles gibberish onto her clipboard as you and Rox head out
>Evident from the fact that she doesn’t even have paper clipped to it
>”Remind me to bring some pliers tomorrow,” Rox mutters to you as you walk to her car. “We’ll get that stick out of her ass one way or another.”
>She stifles a chuckle
>”Unless she’s into that sort of thing, am I right?”
>Rox punches you on the shoulder
 >”Nah, we’ll get her some tail eventually. Someone’s a little higher on the list, though....”
>Rox’s rubs the spot where she hit you with her paw
>Her warm, golden eyes quicken your heartbeat
>She draws in a breath, and leans forward
>”But maybe another night. I’m bushed. Carry me?”
>She yawns and drapes herself over your back
>Dragging her heels the whole way to the parking lot
>Now she’s just being a damn tease
>And teases don’t get their ears scratched
>”Fine. If you’re so broken up about it, I guess we can settle for cuddles. That a good compromise?”
>Those ARE pretty nice...
>”And a few scratches on the chin.”
>Now she’s pushing her luck
>”I’ll talk you into it. Race you there!”
>Rox leans back and picks you off the ground
>She carries you like this the rest of the way to the car



[[ CHAPTER 12: Rox the Boat ]]

>It’s amazing that Rox manages to drive home practically half asleep
>The motivation of a warm bed is all that’s keeping her awake at this point
>Today took a lot out of her
>Once she parks the car, it’s back to leaning on your back
>This time, it really feels like she needs you for balance
>”Nggaahh...” Rox moans. “You’re going to have to cram dinner down my throat.”
>She snickers in your ear
>You’re alone in the effort to get the two of you into the apartment
>At least until Rox leans against you to push the door open
>Chee immediately leaps from the couch
>”There you are!” she squeals. “I’ve been waiting ages!”
>”You couldn’t have gotten here any faster than a few minutes ahead of us, Chee,” Rox says
>”It felt like ages...” the bird pouts
>”Why the rush, anyway?” Rox says. “You’re never this eager to leave work.”
>”Well, you said you were going to tell us about that ‘mascot initiative’ thing. You sounded so happy! I couldn’t wait to hear about it!”
>”You’re going to have to anyway,” Rox mumbles. “I’m wiped out. I’ll tell you guys about it tomorrow.”
>”No! Roxie, you said you would! I won’t be able to sleep if you make me wait!”
>”Yeah, and I won’t be able to do anything BUT sleep right now.”
>Chee hops up and down, looking to you for reinforcement
>After all, you’re carrying Rox
>The wolfess is not going anywhere unless you take her there
>No bed for her until she keeps her word
>”Traitor,” Rox mutters to you. “Fine, I’ll give you a teaser. I probably shouldn’t even be talking much about this yet. It’s not a guaranteed thing.”
>You deposit the wolfess onto the couch heavily
>Chee takes her position right next to her roommate
>Rox yawns to stall for time, but there’s only so long she can hold off the bird’s excitement
>”So...like I said to Sher last week, I ‘overheard’ a bit of inside baseball about the company’s plans to get humans integrated with us.”
>”How did you—?”
>Rox cuts the bird off
>”You want the important parts or not?”
>”Sorry....”
>Knowing Rox, she was probably getting chewed out by Sherry-K and happened to be in the right spot
>”Anyway,” Rox continues, “it sounded like they were still tossing around ideas, but one of the major ones was the ‘mascot initiative”. Now that we already have Anon with us as a test subject, it looks like they’re going to go ahead with the next step.”
>Chee opens her beak to interrupt again, but is glared down by Rox
>”SO, what it is...is that some of us will get to go and perform for the humans... WITHOUT costumes.”
>Chee practically sucks all the air out of the room with her gasp
>Luckily there’s enough left for you, because the news catches you off guard as well
>The oriole sputters for words while the wolfess waits for her to calm down
>”It’s not going to be that easy, obviously. We’re still going to have to be ‘dressed up’ and act like we’re just humans wearing some skin-tight, high quality costumes. We’re also probably getting shoved out of reach of humans at first; like, we’d get put into an attraction and pretend that we’re animatronics or something.”
>Rox shrugs
>”I don’t know how they’re going to handle it, but the plan is to get humans used to the idea of having our kind around and gradually implant the idea that, ‘Hey, wouldn’t it be cool if these creatures actually exist?’”
>Well, there are probably more than a few out there who would love the idea right off the bat
>Though you’d understand why the Whimsey Corporation wouldn’t want to rush things and create panic among those who aren’t ready for anthros yet
>Chee finally manages to slip a question in
>”But...what character would you be then?”
>Rox laughs uneasily
>”That’s another hard part. There isn’t exactly a ‘Rox the Wolf’ character. Not yet, anyway. Whimsey’s going to have to roll out a new line of characters just for this occasion. That’s why they need the best of the best for performers: it’s a massive investment for them. They’re not going to have an easy time finding a replacement for me if I fuck things up or don’t show up for work.”
>Chee isn’t looking at the potential negatives
>”EEEE! My Roxie’s going to be famous!”
>She hugs the wolfess tightly
>”I’m going to buy ALL your merchandise! I’ll be your biggest fan!”
>”Easy, Chee. It’s going to be weeks or even MONTHS before they start making changes like this. And like I said, nothing’s guaranteed yet. I still have to be accepted first, and....”
>Rox sighs
>”Sher’s right. I have a pretty crappy record working against me. Why would they pick me when there are others who are just as hard of workers and DON’T have a huge stack of reprimands?”
>”That’s not true!” Chee cries
>”C’mon, Chee. Yeah it is. Sher’s got a shelf in her office just for me, and—“
>”No, I mean the other part! You’re the hardest working person I know when you want to be, and even Sherry-K knows it! Anon knows it, too!”
>Well, if Rox can keep up the same level of intensity she showed today, then there’s really no doubt she’s fit for the position
>Rox puts an arm around Chee
>Then you as well
>”Thanks, Chee. Thank you both. I’m going to need all the support I can get if I’m going to make it. Probably going to have to start kissing a lot of ass, too....”
>She shakes her head with a smirk
>”I bet Sher’s going to enjoy that, especially since she’s the one who’s going to help get us that talk with Whimsey Jr.”
>Chee should probably be more concerned about that than she’s showing
>But of course she’s looking forward to meeting one of her biggest idols
>Rox stares off in contemplation
>”I’ll have a much better chance of getting the job if I meet with him. Show him who I am and what I can really do, ya know? But...”
>Rox turns to you with a look of joy
>She gives you a squeeze
>”Really that’s just an afterthought compared to getting him to meet YOU. Anon, you’re way more important than I am right now. We need you to help bridge the gap between our worlds.”
>There’s a drop of dew in her eye
>”And if I had to give up this opportunity—if I had to give up my whole JOB—just to make sure you get the freedom you deserve back...you can be damn sure I’d do it in a heartbeat. I....”
>It’s just now that Rox remembers Chee’s siting right there
>”I think it’s time for bed,” the wolfess says
>”Whaaat? Aww....”
>”I told you I’m tired. Besides, we’ll get more info straight from the tiger’s mouth tomorrow. That is, IF she actually shows up.”
>Chee looks hopeful
>”I bet she will! She’s changed!”
>Rox grins devilishly
>”A bet? You want to make that an official wager? Say, for drinks?”
>”N-no way! You got us in a lot of trouble the last time I made a bet with you!”
>”But didn’t we make a great new friend because of it?”
>Rox shakes you playfully in front of Chee
>”Well...yeah...Anon IS a great friend....”
>You get sandwiched in between bird and wolfess
>The affection you get from both of them is genuine and abundant
>Truthfully, you can’t imagine a better duo to get roped into a situation like this with
>”Hey,” Chee pipes, “if Sherry-K DOES show up, maybe we can invite her back for a movie night?”
>”Let’s...take things one step at a time, Chee.”

>With Chee’s curiosity satisfied for now, everyone gets ready for bed
>Rox reaches up to you from her seat on the couch
>”Little help?”
>You probably wouldn’t be able to life her up if she didn’t actually try to stand herself
>You get her off the couch and onto your back once again
>She keeps yawning as you trudge to the bedroom
>”Thanks, buddy.”
>With no small feat, you manage to deposit Rox onto the bed
>She flops onto it with the grace of a pile of...
>...Well, rocks
>The wolfess makes all sorts of sleepy noises as you join her
>She stretches for the lights, but freezes
>”Ah, damn. Left my nightshirt on the other side of the room.”
>Oh, brother...
>When you try to stand to get it for her, you’re yanked right back down
>”Don’t worry about it. We’re both too tired to go after it.”
>That girl is something else
>After a moment of silence, Rox speaks up again
>”Actually, do you mind if I take yours for the night?”
>The request surprises you a bit
>You’ve already had a few intimate moments with Rox, but wearing each other’s clothes seems to solidify the relationship in a way
>It might not fight her too well, but whatever
>”Thanks.”
>She yanks it off your body, leaving your torso bare
>”Goodnight,” Rox yawns one final time
>She kicks the lights off and you hear the ruffling of her own shirt coming off
>Oddly, you never hear the subsequent ruffling of your shirt going onto her
>The wolfess pulls you into her chest as the little spoon
>Her silky fury coat feels amazing on your back
>But you also feel something else
>Two points of flesh
>Her...nipples?
>Rox never intended on wearing your shirt
>The skin of her chest presses even more into your back as she swells with a deep inhale
>”Anon,” she says dreamily
>Her breathing is slow, and she’s on the verge of drifting off to sleep at any moment
>”Anon....”
>You answer her, but it’s a while before she responds
>”There’s something I need to get off my chest.”
>She hums weakly at the joke as she pulls you in even tighter
>”You HAVE been a great friend, but it doesn’t stop there. It’s not enough to stop there.”
>More deep, slow breathing
>You wonder if she’s a little delirious from fatigue
>Yet at the same time, there’s sincerity in her voice
>”Anon....”
>More breathing
>Followed by a sharp sniff
>”I...I love you, Anon.”
>As her heartbeat begins to slow, yours only gets faster
>Love
>That does more than solidify your relationship
>It sets the foundation for another whole level
>”Love you...” she repeats a little softer
>Her paw strokes your head as she clings to you
>She draws her knees up, forcing your legs to curl closer to your body
>No longer is this for warmth, or even fondness
>She wants to be inside you
>She wants you to be a part of her
>”I hope...you can...say the same.”
>And those are her final words before sleep overcomes her
>She can’t hold it off any longer and join you in the realm of the conscious as you’re overwhelmed by countless thoughts
>Will she feel the same way when she wakes up?
>Will the other anthros be tolerant of this, or will it be one more secret you’ll have to keep?
>What does this mean for the future?
>Rox must sense your worries, even in her slumber
>She nuzzles you protectively
>Passionately
>Caringly
>Endlessly
>Her paws knead your skin and her breaths blow gentle air over you
>No, this isn’t just some admission mistakenly made in a stupor
>If anything she’s more uninhibited now than she’s ever been
>Maybe it was the closeness you shared today
>Maybe it was everything you did for her to save her job
>She could have been holding this in for days, or weeks
>Or was it even love at first sight?
>You’ve only seen the true Rox for mere days now, but it feels like you’ve known her forever, inside and out
>You can’t deny you have requited feelings for the wolfess on multiple levels
>Yes, even lustful ones at times
>But this was the best possible timing for her to confess her love to you, without base or carnal desires getting in the way
>Well, besides her “working out” her sentiments for you
>Her beautiful fur brushes against you
>Her golden eyes continue to radiate even while closed
>You can feel her athletic, toned form as she caresses you snugly
>You can count every heartbeat from her chest
>Even the warm flesh of her nipples against your back becomes less erotic, and more of a physical connection to her very being
>Thinking of a more peaceful end to the day is near impossible
>Though you give a muted chuckle at the thought of poor Chee walking into the room to wake up Rox tomorrow morning
>And seeing more of Rox than she probably ever has before
>Hopefully you can get your shirt on her before that can happen
>Although you’re mostly locked in place by the wolfess’ tender hold, you can still turn your head enough to give her a kiss on the muzzle
>Without looking, you can feel her lips curl into a subtle look of contentment
>Goodnight, Rox



[[ CHAPTER 13: Rox, Paper, Scissors ]]

>You can hear Chee moving around in her usual chipper, morning way
>Oh shit
>Rox
>You turn to look at the stirring wolfess
>And then reflexively turn away
>She’s still half naked
>Before you can say anything she pulls you back into her chest
>”I don’t know about you, but I had the best sleep in ages!”
>She’s deliberately rubbing herself against you
>Your ear is engulfed by her muzzle as she gives it a few frisky bites
>It’s a moral conflict whether to let her do her thing, or remind her about turning over a new leaf for work
>You sort of split the difference
>You let her continue her antics while pointing out the time
>”Did you forget our Chee-ry little alarm clock?” Rox says as she nips at your neck
>That’s actually the problem here
>The poor girl’s going to have quite the sight if she walks in with the two of you like this
>Rox sighs and wipes the wetness from your face and neck
>”Yeah, I hear ya. Don’t want to scare her with the puppies hanging out.”
>You hear her throw your shirt on
>Then it’s right back to hugging you
>You’re not making a lot of progress here...
>You can see her snout in the corner of your eye as the wolfess rests her head on your shoulder
>”Hey,” Rox says, suddenly more reserved, “about last night....”
>There’s a moment of worry within you
>Is she going to regret what happened?
>Play it off as a joke?
>”I know I was pretty far gone by the end of it, but I hope I got through to you.”
>Her paws brush over your bare skin as her arms interlock over your chest
>”I really meant it. All of it. I gotta hide from you way too much during the day. I don’t want to have to do that when we’re together like this.”
>She squeezes you so firmly her claws are almost uncomfortably digging into you
>”I guess I never actually asked if you’re into wolf girls in the first place. I mean you didn’t seem to mind the kisses and everything....”
>She chuckles apologetically
>”But I just wanted to check. You know, before things get messy. And let’s be honest: you’re kind of a weird human to be into someone like me.”
>Rox seems to love putting you in tight positions you can’t wiggle out of easily
>Though she always leaves you just enough room to give her some reassurance
>Like raising a hand to touch her muzzle fondly
>The wolfess nuzzles your cheek with hers
>”I promise you, Anon, you’re safe with me. No matter what we have to go through from here on out...if you want me in your life, you’ll have me for life.”
>Her soft, pointed ears flick over your face as she continues rubbing her head all over you
>”Don’t tell Chee, but I already HAVE my biggest fan. Right?”
>Right
>”Roxie? Are you up yet?”
>”Yes, mom...” Rox groans
>At least she’s dressed

>You weren’t expecting Rox to perform with the same amount of drive as she did yesterday
>However, she still puts in a surprising amount of vigor
>You can see the ambition in her eyes, even when fully masked
>There’s a lot she wants to prove to a lot of different people
>You can tell you’re included as one of them
>What exactly she wants to prove to you, though, is unclear
>She already has your love and companionship
>She already has your forgiveness (at least until her next screw-up)
>Maybe this is the new Rox?
>Her improved work ethic can only be a plus for the both of you
>And yet, you hope she won’t lose any of that spunky personality along the way
>It might be selfish, but a part of you would rather see Rox happy as she is rather than beat herself up over a possible new opportunity
>Fortunately, it looks like she hasn’t lost that spirit yet
>At least until the shift comes to a close
>It’s been a long day of signing autographs and dancing around the park
>When the last of the meet-and-greet line vanishes, so does her energy
>”I really, really, REALLY need a drink tonight,” she says
>Déjà vu
>Now all that’s left is to be dragged into the women’s locker room
>”Nah, I won’t make you do that again,” Rox reassures you. “I only did it because we were working so late I just KNEW the place was going to be empty. But tonight, we’re not staying a minute past the hour.”
>Well, there goes that improved work ethic
>”Besides....”
>She gives you one of her affectionate headlocks
>”Not gonna let any other girls try and make a move on you,” she growls playfully. “You’re MY Anon. Mine!”
>If she hugged you any harder you’d be in the suit with her
>You’re actually getting worried she might carry you into the locker room with her after all with how long she hangs on to you

>Back at the Booze Cruise
>The usual crowd is here, giving you the usual wary glances
>Though they seem to go back to their business faster than usual
>Guess the novelty of having a human among them is wearing off
>Down below on the lower level are the rest of the humans, completely unaware of the anthros who sit behind the one-way window above them
>Their lives seem so dull now compared to yours
>You’d never be able to live among them again after everything you’ve experienced
>Chee arrives around the same time as you and Rox, and the three of you grab a table with an extra chair
>Just in case
>”Last chance, Chee,” Rox says. “How confident are you that Sher is going to show up?”
>The oriole squirms in her seat
>”I believe in Sherry-K, but....”
>”But....?”
>”I don’t want to have to pay for the drinks again!”
>Rox laughs and pats Chee on the back
>”Alright, don’t worry. I’ll pick up the tab tonight, and I’ll treat everyone to a round if she shows up like you think she will.”
>Chee smiles in relief
>Rox smacks her paw on the table a few times
>”But we’re not waiting up for her. My night starts right now.”
>She goes up to the bar to bug Cookie
>You can tell from the panda’s face he must be surprised Rox is opening a tab in her own name
>The wolfess brings each of you back a drink
>She already has two ready to go
>Chee reluctantly sips hers through a straw, waiting for the tigress to show up
>”Well, Chee, looks like it’s a good thing we didn’t make it a bet after all,” Rox says with a smirk. “That would have been a helluva bill with how much I plan to dr—oh, dammit.”
>Sherry-K enters the bar
>You’ve never seen Chee look so smug
>The bird waves the tigress over, but Rox stops her from getting too far
>”No no no...you’re not walking in her wearing that shirt,” she says
>If you didn’t glance a look at Sherry-K’s undershirt when you were at her place, you’d think the pinstripe coordinator outfit is the only thing in her wardrobe
>Sherry-K creases her brow
>”You should be happy I took you up on the offer in the first place. I didn’t have much time after work t—
>”You wearing anything under that?” Rox cuts her off
>”Well, yes, but....”
>”Lose the stripes, Stripes.”
>Sherry-K looks more than a little flustered
>She slowly takes off the coordinator shirt
>Of course, it’s all Whimsey underneath
>”Unbelievable,” Rox sighs
>”It looks so cute on you!” Chee says
>Sherry-K’s ears flatten as she sits down
>But they perk back up when Rox slides her backup drink over
>”Well, it’s good to see you, Sher,” Rox says. “Really. Guess I’m getting a round for everyone after all.”
>”I have no qualms about paying for myself,” the tigress says.
>”Yeah, well, if we’re going to make this friendship thing work, you’re going to have to take the charity now and then,” Rox says
>Sherry-K takes an graceful sip from her drink
>“I’m aware of the costly employee housing situation, so I hope you’re a little more frugal in other aspects of your life.”
>Rox is seconds away from calling off the truce altogether, but Chee interjects
>”But that’s all the more reason to accept her generosity!” the bird says. “She wants to spend what little she has left to hang out with you!”
>Sherry-K gives Rox an inquisitive look
>Well, the wolfess doesn’t flat out DENY it, at least
>Though she looks like she’s uncomfortably biting her tongue
>While Rox stews for a bit, Chee jumps in to save the day again
>”So! Did everyone have a good day?”
>Or, maybe she’s about to make things worse
>”It’s always a good day when everything runs up to par,” Sherry-K says
>”So you didn’t have to write anyone up, then?” Rox scoffs
>Sherry-K doesn’t respond
>Everyone drinks in silence for a few minutes
>Rox is finished first and goes to get some more alcohol
>Rounds for the whole table
>Multiple rounds
>Sherry-K’s eyes go wide
>”I don’t suppose you’re expecting more to join us?” she says
>”Just start drinking,” Rox snaps
>Chee is still taking her time with her first beverage
>Both Rox and Sherry-K outpace you
>You don’t know a whole lot about anthros yet, but you can pick up some of the signs of them getting inebriated
>Tails sway slower
>Whiskers and ears droop
>Heads hand a little lower
>Sherry-K leans over to one side so far you think you might have to catch her
>But she just reaches into a handbag and takes a small leather folder out
>”Before I forget,” she says, stifling a hiccup. “Chee, I want you to have this, as a show of thanks for being patient with everything.”
>Rox doesn’t seem to quite understand what the tigress means, but she’s a little too intoxicated to really care
>You, on the other hand, have a pretty good idea why Chee’s being rewarded
>Chee opens the folder and immediately knocks over her glass with shock
>You’re fumbling with the napkins as Chee looks to Sherry-K all misty eyed
>”B-but...these are the silver-lined 50th anniversary Whimsey pins! Only...only the coordinators got them!”
>Sherry-K makes some kind of weird waving motion with her paw
>Either she’s telling the bird to keep it down, or she’s batting an invisible ball of yarn
>Now she has Rox’s full attention
>”I know how much into collecting them you are,” the tigress says. “I decided I...perhaps need to remove some of the ‘clutter’ from my home.”
>”Yeah, well, if it’s clutter you gave it to the wrong girl,” Rox laughs, a little more forcefully than she normally would
>Chee holds the folder to her chest proudly
>”Are you sure I can have these?” she says
>”Yes, I am,” Sherry-K says with a nod. “They should go to someone who...would appreciate them more.”
>”What’s that supposed to mean, Sher?” Rox says
>The tigress swirls the ice in her glass absentmindedly
>”I suppose I’ve gotten a little disenfranchised with the company lately. I’m...burned out.”
>Chee looks like someone told her Santa Claus isn’t real
>Like she doesn’t comprehend how anyone could dare be tired of Whimsey
>”My whole life is here,” the tigress continues, “and there’s nothing for me outside of it. When I return home for the night, it’s just to wait for my next shift.”
>You’re worried she’s going to have a meltdown again, though she’s fighting it back
>”I figured if I remove some of the clutter...some of what’s needlessly filling my life, maybe I’ll have room for something I can take pride in again....”
>Rox slams her glass down loudly
>”That’s it!”
>Several nearby bar patrons give your table a confused look
>The wolfess lowers her voice, now a little more conscious of her surroundings
>”Sher, we need to get you a girlfriend,” Rox whispers
>Another glass topples over
>The tigress looks beyond flustered at this point
>”I don’t know WHY you think—“
>”Oh, knock it off already,” Rox interrupts. “We all knew you’re unhappy, and you flat out admitted it! It can’t just be about YOUR burdens all the time. You need someone in your life who’s your better half when you need the support.”
>She gives you a brief glance before turning to Chee
>”What’s the name of that fox girl again? The one who’s always hanging around Petch?”
>Chee blinks
>”Mionra? Why do you...?”
>”Yeah, her. She’s not dating Petch right now or anything, is she?”
>”W-what? Why would they be dating?”
>Rox gives Chee the most unamused look you can imagine
>”Chee, really? Have I been wrong about this sort of stuff yet?”
>Sherry-K coughs while Chee tries to comprehend the sudden revelation
>Meanwhile, Rox turns to the tigress and scoots her chair closer
>Meaning she scoots you closer as well
>”What do you think, Sher? Vixens do anything for you? She seems like the kind of livewire girl who isn’t going to buckle and be all submissive just because you ask her to. You want to work for your girl’s heart, right?”
>Sherry-K struggles to keep her professional façade held together
>Eventually, she gives in
>”She certainly seems like a nice girl...” the tigress mumbles
>”Well, I won’t push you two together if you’re not sure, but I can at least see what she thinks of you, deal?”
>Sherry-K looks crestfallen
>”She isn’t going to like me. Nobody does.”
>”Not with that attitude, missy.”
>Rox pulls Sherry-K’s head against her own
>You’re caught in the middle of their large bodies
>”Look, what you said really hit a little too close to home for me. About being burned out from this place and all. I was a miserable wreck before I met Anon, and there’s someone out there for you as well. You’ve done enough for us, so let us to this thing for you.”
>It’s clear Sherry-K still laments Rox being unavailable, but at least the wolfess and tigress look like they’re going to be good bosom buddies
>And you can tell firsthand, being trapped between their chests
>Though Rox inadvertently told a little bit more about herself than you expected
>Was she really that miserable before meeting you?
>Where did she lose that sense of wonder Chee manages to still hang on to?
>Guess it’s another mystery for another time...
>The two women release each other and everyone finishes their drinks
>Rox is probably going to need another ride back home from Chee
>Which means you will as well
>Luckily Sherry-K sobers up well enough
>”Before you all leave, let’s talk briefly about tomorrow.”
>Rox moans in exasperation
>”Sher, really!? Can you stop thinking of work for five freaking minutes?”
>”Tomorrow’s Cast Night again,” Sherry-K continues. “Since you and Anon were off work last week, you’ll be running the attractions this time. Chee has graciously decided to skip her off week so she will be able to train Anon.”
>Rox recoils
>”Wha...train him? What about me?”
>”You may be one of our better performers, Roksa, but you don’t have the qualifications to be a trainer for the attractions yet.”
>Chee can’t get any smugger than this
>”However, this means the three of you will be able to enjoy Cast Night together starting next week. You’re welcome.”
>Rox grumbles to herself
>It’s not like the two of you are splitting shifts
>She’s still pretty pissed about it, though
>Guess Rox has gotten pretty possessive of you ever since her suspension
>Sherry-K excuses herself for the night, looking remarkably pleased with herself
>It’s not from her own smugness, either
>Having people she can call friends suddenly fall into her life has already done wonders for her
>She doesn’t even put her coordinator shirt back on as she heads out of the bar
>Rox finishes off what drinks Sherry-K left behind
>”That was really sweet what you said to her, Roxie,” Chee says
>Rox turns to the bird with a scowl
>”Listen here, Chee. Anon is MINE. Don’t even think of pulling anything funny when you’re training him tomorrow.”
>”W-what? Roxie, I’d never!”
>That’s one way of wiping someone’s smugness away...
>Rox mutters drunkenly as Chee closes out the tab for her
>The wolfess goes limp as you drop her into the back seat of the car
>She’s is out cold during the drive back
>Chee only shakes her head
>”Maybe I should have bought the drinks after all,” she says. “Roxie doesn’t go quite so overboard like that when she knows it’s someone else’s money....”
>The bird clicks her tongue with pity
>”She really cares about you.”
>Yeah
>So much so that you’ll have to end up carrying her back to the apartment for the second night in a row



[[ CHAPTER 14: Roxie Road ]]

>It’s one thing to carry Rox when she’s teasingly hanging onto you
>It’s another thing altogether when she’s practically a blacked out dead weight
>Even Chee has to pitch in to get the wolfess into the apartment
>”She couldn’t have just waited until the weekend,” the bird sighs
>Hopefully Rox can rebound in time for work tomorrow
>Though apparently on days when anthro employees run the attractions for Cast Night, they get to start their normal shift a little later
>Which is good, because there’s a chance Rox could ralph in the Whirly Barf
>You’re tempted to throw her into a cold shower
>But having to dry her off would just make even more work for yourself
>Chee helps you until the three of you make it to Rox’s room
>The wolfess stirs with a moan
>”Oh, what a relief,” Chee says. “Roxie, don’t scare me like that!”
>Rox just mumbles
>Chee leaves you and Rox alone with one of her happy little “goodnights”
>”Sooo...” Rox slurs, “whatsh on the menu tonigh’?”
>Bed
>You draw back the covers and slide her to her spot
>She tries to take off her shirt but gets tangled up in it instead
>”Hang on...almosh got it...”
>No, not tonight
>Not like this
>You pull the covers over her and tuck in the sides
>”Fine,” she huffs
>All wrapped up in the sheets like a giant burrito, Rox watches you get into bed with half-closed eyes
>You scoot in next to her, and the wolfess sticks her tongue out
>Rox tries vainly to lean in and lick your face
>Guess you can let her have a little fun...
>You move your head closer so she can slather you with her kisses
>The smell of alcohol is noticeable, but it doesn’t detract from the affection
>When you’ve had enough of her saliva, you stave her off with scratches on the chin
>She hums blissfully
>”No fair...I can’t move....”
>That’s probably a good thing
>Both of you are a lot safer that way
>You scratch Rox to sleep
>When you know she’s deep in slumber, you hit the lights
>It might still be dangerous to be too close to her when she’s like this, but it doesn’t feel right to sleep without the warmth of her body
>You snuggle in against her, making sure to keep her nice and wrapped up
>Much better

>There’s a pitcher of water waiting for you in the morning
>Chee is a saint
>She’s also incredibly lucky she didn’t walk into anything scandalous
>Rox is still encased in the sheets when you wake her up
>”Woah...” she groans. “What did we do last night that you had to tie me up for?”
>She manages to wiggle free and grab the pitcher of water
>The whole thing is drained in a few seconds
>She must see a little concern in your face, laughing it off
>”It’s going to take a little more than a minor hangover to keep me down,” she grunts
>Still, she looks at you a little shamefully
>”I, uh, didn’t do anything really stupid last night, did I?”
>Well, she snapped at Chee a little bit, but the bird didn’t seem to take it personally
>And to you, it was at least motivated by love and concern, right?
>Rox was just making sure nobody tried to steal you from her
>”Damn, I’ll apologize to her anyway...but, was I really that jealous?”
>It might have been the alcohol talking mostly
>”No, I definitely was being stupid.”
>Rox raps her claws on the pitcher
>”I was just so happy I could finally tell you I love you...that I guess I got a little too overbearing about it.”
>She tries to get the last drop of water out of the pitcher, fruitlessly
>”When I told you I would keep you safe, I might have been looking at it a little backwards.”
>Rox looks at you with her beautiful golden eyes and a timid smile to match
>”You make me feel safe, Anon. I can express myself better when I’m with you. I can sleep better when I’m with you. I just feel like a completely different person.”
>She tosses the pitcher aside and pulls you into a full embrace before it even hits the ground
>Your face is buried in the fluff of her neck
>”So it’s your fault my life is like this. Thanks...for being a part of it.”
>The two of you share the moment for a while
>The quiet, gentle intimacy is a wonderful start to the day
>You realize Chee has already left for work, letting you and Rox sleep in
>Though you don’t have a ton of time to waste before the two of you need to get ready for your own shifts
>”Guess we better head out,” Rox says. “We're going to have to grab the bus as long as my car's hanging out back at the bar. At least we have the weekend ahead of us.”
>She gives you a knowing smile, as though she already has something special in mind

>The day’s shift goes by enjoyably fast
>You don’t have to spend the entirety of it among the humans, and a part of you is looking forward to Cast Night
>Even though it’s basically the second half of your workday
>You keep your uniform on while waiting for Rox to slip out of her costume
>While performers don’t have to dance around in costume for Cast Night, the rest are “encouraged” to wear their Whimsey outfits to give an authentic experience
>To make the anthros feel like guests themselves
>Even the ones working behind-the-scenes have to get into their proper attire
>Coming out of the men’s locker room is Baggy and a pheasant named Ace
>Short for “Amadeus”, tragically
>The black panther has since warmed up to you slightly, though he still isn’t quite personable yet
>Ace, on the other hand, doesn’t have the same problem with being approachable
>”Hey, Anon?” he says, keeping his voice low. “You’re roommates with Rox and, uh...uh...right?”
>Rox and Chee?
>”Yeah, yeah. So, I was wondering, since you know them, if you could ask—“
>Rox joins up with you before Ace can finish his thought
>”O-oh, never mind. I’ll talk to you later.”
>The pheasant hurries off to catch Baggy
>Rox gives you a confused look
>”Well, I’ll fight off the girls for you, but you’re on your own with the dudes.”
>She laughs and grabs hold of you in her typical fashion
>Welp, time for round two of the night
>Sherry-K intercepts the two of you with her clipboard cradled in its usual spot
>”Roksa, you will be at Rumble Rolloff as usual tonight.”
>The wolfess grumbles
>”Anon, since Chee will be training you, you will join her at Little Happy Planet.”
>Suddenly Rox has a much more amused attitude
>”Ouch. Good luck with that one, champ. Hope you don’t end up with that song on the brain.”
>Sherry-K gives Rox a dismissive look, and the wolfess shuffles off to her ride
>”This will only be for a short period,” the tigress explains, “and possibly only for tonight. Employees don’t typically double up on Cast Night except for the most complicated attractions, so you will be assigned elsewhere once you have the basics down.”
>You’re sent off to meet up with Chee, who looks overjoyed to take you under her wing
>”Are you ready?” the bird sings
>Not anymore, knowing what kind of attraction you’re in for
>”Great! I’ll show you the ropes! I won’t make you ride it first, since you’re already familiar with it.”
>If you didn’t know better, you’d say Chee has a faint mischievous look on her face

>You’re led into the backstage area and up to the control room
>It’s behind a series of hallways and a heavily locked door
>Inside are the kind of buttons and monitors you’d expect from an attraction control room
>But there are posters and pictures similar to the ones you’ve seen in the anthro parts of the underground tunnels
>”We run many of the rides ourselves,” Chee whispers, as though concerned there’s anyone else up here
>She points to one of the monitors where you can barely make out where a second control room would be
>”The humans operate some of the easy stuff because they think these rides practically run themselves. And they do, but WE control the important stuff!”
>She twists her wings like she were turning a steering wheel
>”It’s like when you were just a chick and your dad would pretend like YOU were the one driving the car!”
>Yeah, just like when you were a chick...
>Chee gives you a full rundown of the controls
>Like she said, it’s a pretty sophisticated setup that almost runs itself
>You mostly have to worry about how to fix when things go wrong as opposed to how to keep things going right
>How to turn on emergency lights
>How to reroute the boats
>What to do if the ride stops
>Or rather, how to make the ride stop in case you need to trap a pair of lovers in the middle of it...
>Every time you pick up on something new, Chee looks thrilled
>”Very good! You’re catching on really quick!”
>Now you wish your mascot handler trainer was this enthusiastic
>When you have just about everything covered, Chee is ready to let you run things on your own
>”We’re allowed to be down by the queue where the greeters stand if there’s nobody on the ride,” she says, “so I’ll let you stay here to watch over the controls alone while I go get some riders. Think of it like a final test!”
>She hops off to the entryway of the attraction
>You can see her on one of the monitors
>She obviously knows them all by heart as well, waving up at you
>The oriole stands patiently as the anthros below mill about
>Very clearly singing the Little Happy Planet tune to herself
>She glances up at you now and then with a smile
>Not a lot of traffic tonight
>Eventually, Sherry-K approaches the ride
>You can see her tapping her clipboard, and Chee ushers the tigress inside
>Does she even know you’re up here?
>She didn’t seem to wonder why you aren't down there with Chee
>You watch Sherry-K on the monitors
>She gets into one of the boats and sets aside her clipboard
>As she takes off from the station, you can see her usual professional demeanor melt away
>A goofy grin forms on her face as she floats along the stream
>By the halfway mark she’s swaying and moving her mouth to the melody
>With the photo station shut off the ride pictures won’t save, but she obviously knows that
>She gives a wide, toothy smile anyway as the light flashes
>The tigress is just a bigger version of the beaming little girl in the photo you saw at her place
>But as the boat returns to the station she composes herself and approaches Chee once more
>She taps her clipboard with a nod, and the bird waves a goodbye as the tigress heads off to make her rounds through the rest of the park
>Looks like everything’s going smoothly
>In more ways than one
>Off in the distance you can see Chee’s friend Mionra standing at the front of Ratty ol’ Mansion
>Sherry-K goes through the same process of talking with the anthro running the ride before “inspecting” it herself
>Though that’s not all she inspects
>As Sherry-K heads through the line to enter the attraction, she gives a quick glance behind her
>As if sizing up the vixen

>It’s an even easier shift than the earlier one, though perhaps a little more boring
>Doesn’t seem like many anthros want to ride Little Happy Planet
>Doesn’t stop Chee from taking enormous pride in her attraction
>So she’s a little heartbroken when the night’s finally over
>The park lights flash dimly, signaling to everyone to pack it in
>Not even a minute later Rox is running up to you
>”About time,” she says. “If you start humming that damn song you’re sleeping on the couch again. How was it?”
>You tell her things went pretty well
>Sherry-K’s inspection seemed to go well, too
>Rox smirks at the comment, knowing exactly what you mean
>”Yeah, I always figured that’s what she’s up to. Never comes near Rumble Rolloff though. Can’t imagine why....”
>Chee flitters up to the two of you
>”Hey, Chee,” Rox says. “Sorry you had to get stuck with this two weeks in a row.”
>”Oh, it was no problem!” the bird says. “Anon was good company, and I’ll be off the next few days anyway!”
>”Oh, right. Your parents are visiting, aren’t they?”
>You can sense Rox knew this all along, as she gives you a sly look
>”Mm hmm! You two will have to take care of the place yourselves. I’ll be staying with them in the suites!”
>The anthros get their own versions of resort rooms on the park grounds
>Likely some of the “special suites” Chee means
>It’s still a little sad that they have to hide out even when they’re supposed to be enjoying themselves
>But from the sounds of it, you’re going to be playing a big part in someday letting them commingle with humans
>Hopefully you’ll get a chance to see that in your lifetime
>You snap out of your thoughts as you realize Rox has been elbowing you in the ribs all the way back to the employee tunnels
>When you acknowledge her, you see the wolfess’ eyebrows dancing up and down
>She definitely has something in mind for the two of you while your roommate is gone



[[ CHAPTER 15: Rox the Cradle ]]

>It’s up to Chee to be your ride again
>Or at least so she can drop you and Rox off at the bar
>”Hey, wanna grab another quick drink?” Rox says
>Chee stares daggers at her, not having any more shenanigans
>”Yeesh, I was kidding,” the wolfess says. “Well, kind of.”
>The poor bird sighs
>Sometimes it’s hard to be Rox’s roommate
>”You can do what you want, Roxie,” Chee says, “but I’ll be in bed when you get back. I’m going to leave early in the morning to meet up with my parents.”
>”Alright, hope you have a good time. Bring them around the apartment to say hi.”
>Rox gives you a wink
>”Just maybe give us a warning so we have the place cleaned up.”
>Chee looks uneasy
>”Well...they already know about Anon like everyone else, but I haven’t really told them he’s living with us....”
>Everyone else?
>You suppose it’s only natural that word would have spread among the anthros like wildfire
>Both the girls look at you pitifully
>”Well,” Rox says, “give it some thought, I guess. I’m not going to stow Anon away all alone. We can hang out at the park until it all blows over, I guess. If they ask about me, just tell them I’m busy or something.”
>The wolfess’ arm snakes around your waist
>”Or Anon and I can just hide under the bed together.”
>”That sounds like fun.” Chee says. “We should all hide under the bed sometime!”
>Rox rolls her eyes
>”Yeah, sure. I’ll keep that one in mind.”
>Chee is about to leave when Rox stops her
>”Hey, uh, before you turn in for the night, could you give me Mionra’s number?”
>The bird cocks her head to the side
>”I guess so. Why?”
>”I’m gonna try to get Sher some friends, remember?”
>Chee still seems to have trouble grasping Rox’s matchmaking intentions
>Or she’s willfully blocking it from her mind
>”Okay, I’ll get you her number. I think she’s off tomorrow, too!”
>”Even better,” Rox says.
>When Chee finally departs, Rox turns to you with a guilty look
>”Sorry, Anon. I don’t want to spend our weekend hanging out with Chee’s friend, but it’s for a good cause. Besides....”
>She gives you a kiss on the cheek
>”I got something special planned later on. I promise it’ll be worth it.”
>She doesn’t say anything else on the matter as you take her car back to the apartment

>Chee already made it home and raced into her room by the time you and Rox get back
>After a busy day at work, getting an early rest doesn’t sound so bad
>Before you hop into bed, Rox holds you off
>The wolfess just stands there, looking at you
>Silently
>It gets tense in short time
>But Rox smiles before things get too uncomfortable
>”I know I said we’re trying to take things slow, but...if we make some progress, no sense in backpedaling, right?”
>She pulls her shirt off and her breasts bounce free
>You’ve already technically seen them before, but now you get an unabashed look
>They’re pert and modest in size, though not unnatural for her athletic frame
>Her two fleshy nipples are surrounded by short, dark gray fur
>She has no hesitance about letting you stare, but she clearly wants something from you in return
>Like joining her, topless
>You remove your own shirt as she draws the sheets back
>Rox lies down on the bed, but in the middle of where you and her would sleep
>She pats her stomach invitingly
>”I want to try something new tonight. If it doesn’t feel right, we’ll do things the usual way.”
>You crawl onto the bed and Rox hefts you on top of her
>Your toes don’t quite reach her own, while your head rests on her chest
>She holds you in place with one arm while she strokes your neck with the other paw
>The wolfess is your bed now
>And she shows no discomfort about having you as her covering
>When she pulls the sheets over you, you’re surrounded by heavenly softness
>Her slow breaths lift you up and down, lulling you to relaxation
>You can hear her heartbeat as your head settles between her breasts
>You can feel the tenseness in her muscles fade away underneath you
>You can’t ignore that being half naked together like this is at least a little erotic
>Her chuckle resounds through her body and into yours
>”Easy, champ,” Rox says, sensing your arousal.
>Maybe even feeling it a bit, too
>”We’ll get there soon enough, alright? Right now, I’m fine with things just as they are. ”
>You can’t disagree
>Your own arms cling to the wolfess as best as you can as you relish the moment
>Her breathing, her stroking, her warmth
>”Every night I want to be like this, if we can.”
>She brings her muzzle closer, rubbing it along your face
>”And every night, I want it to end with me saying again how much I love you.”
>She kisses you on the cheek once more
>”So try to stay awake until I say it, deal?”
>You fend off sleep as long as you can
>It’s as though Rox is testing your commitment
>But your body surrenders as you feel yourself meld with every curve of hers
>At last, Rox rewards you for the effort
>”Anon....”
>One last kiss
>”Mmm...I love you.”

>How you managed not to roll off the wolfess overnight is a miracle
>And yet, she kept you tightly in her arms through it all
>Not even sleep could stop her from holding you to her breast
>Though your legs DID shift a bit during your slumber
>Rox’s did as well
>Your legs fell between hers, and her ankle hooked around your own to keep you in place
>It’s still a comfortable way to wake up
>Though maybe a little too much
>Your body is tricked into thinking you’re still lying on an incredibly soft mattress
>So your groggy stirring causes you to grind your waist against Rox’s
>She inhales sharply and gives a brief moan so quiet, you wouldn’t have heard it if your head wasn’t pressed to her chest
>Her eyes open, looking at you with an anxious smirk
>”It might take us a little while to get used to this,” she grunts.
>The two of you rise from the bed, and Rox massages your back
>”Maybe we should have waited until we got a little more, uh, ‘used’ to each other,” she snickers. “We may be connected at the hip during the day, but we almost woke up like that too!”
>She gives you a pat as you get ready for the day
>Rox grabs her phone and soon you hear her talking in a cool manner
>To Mionra, presumably
>”Yeah, just a little chat. I’ll treat you to lunch and everything.”
>...
>”Just the three of us. Anon’ll be there too.”
>...
>”Yeah, I’d prefer if she doesn’t. It’s kind of why I want to talk to you. No offense to her or anything.”
>...
>”Sounds good. See you soon.”
>Then the apartment goes quiet
>Eerily quiet
>Rox is gone when you check up on her
>Wait...
>You see a large lump under the covers of the bed
>Guess she wasn’t quite ready to face the day
>But she’s going to have to soon
>You throw back the sheets to find just pillows
>Then you look down in time to see your ankle grabbed by a dark paw
>You’re pulled to the floor and dragged underneath the bed
>There’s a glint in Rox’s golden eyes as she envelops you with her body
>”Just checking the space down here,” she whispers into your ear before nipping at it. “You know, in case we have to lay low for a little while.”
>Hopefully you can get rid of the dust bunnies before that happens
>Now you have to get yourself cleaned up again before going out
>And get Rox to brush her dust-covered fur 

>Rox had arranged the meeting with Mionra at the Cast Complex
>You can’t imagine it would be any anthro’s first choice for spending their whole day off at
>Well, except for Chee
>You’re prepared to see the bird show up with her parents at any more
>Regardless, it’s still one of very few places you’re allowed to go to in Rox’s company
>The two of you grab a table in the cafeteria and wait for your guest
>Rox keeps stroking your legs with her foot
>”Ah, there she is!”
>Mionra is definitely a fox who catches eyes
>Her fur is a fiery shade of orange, like heated metal
>Her eyes are amber like skillfully cut gemstones
>The black on her lips, nose, and around her eyes looks like it was painted on with an ink brush
>No anthro can take your heart away from Rox, but Mionra looks like the kind of vixen you hope ends up in the right hands
>Or paws
>And hopefully Sherry-K’s, if all goes well
>”Thanks for coming, Mio,” Rox says with a nod
>Always with the nicknames, Rox...
>”I have to say, I wasn’t expecting a call from you,” the vixen replies
>If Rox is the fun and Sherry-K is the business, then Mionra fits somewhere in the middle
>She speaks with directness, but you get the sense even if she snaps at someone she’ll do it with a jovial mood
>”Want to grab some food first?” Rox says
>”As long as you’re still buying,” the vixen smiles
>It’s a bit of a wonder why these two haven’t hung out more
>The three of you return to the table with your trays, but you’re the only one to start eating
>”Gonna be blunt about this, Mio,” Rox says. ”I was a little worried when you asked to bring Petch along.”
>Mionra raises her brow a bit in curiosity, then even more when the wolfess leans in close
>”You two aren’t a couple, or....?”
>”Hmm, no, just closely acquainted,” the vixen says. “Petch is a great friend, but we’re not into each other THAT way. She’s a little too...soft for me.”
>Rox has a look about her that says she’s hearing everything she wants to
>”So, you on the market then?” the wolfess says
>Her forwardness is astounding
>Mionra starts to look a little crestfallen
>”You’re not going to tell me you’re available now, are you?” she says
>That catches Rox off guard
>”W-why? Doesn’t everyone know I’m with Anon?”
>”Of course, Rox. But some of us were holding out a little bit of hope you were still single. It’s why I was a bit speechless when you called me out of the blue like that.”
>You and Rox exchange surprised looks
>”Wait, it wasn’t obvious I was straight? Who thought I wasn’t?”
>”Well, everyone, I suppose. A few just assumed you swung that way at first, then the rumors kind of got around. You know how gossip is. You’re not really the most feminine girl, Rox.”
>You can tell the wolfess is a little hurt by the comment
>One of her ears swivels back with her disappointment
>You weren’t expecting Rox to take that so personally, especially given how proud she seems to be with her way of life
>Most of the time, anyway
>”Please, don’t mind me,” the vixen waves. “It’s why you’re so endearing. A lot of girls like that about you. There aren’t too many out there who carry themselves like you do. You have more fans than you probably realize; they’re just too afraid to approach you.”
>”Well, damn,” the wolfess laughs. “Maybe I should have tried experimenting a long time ago.”
>”Maybe there’s still time?” Mionra offers with a shrug
>”Nah, sorry. I’m really flattered, but Anon’s already in my life and he has me all to himself.”
>Rox puts a paw on your lap
>”But there’s someone else out there who needs a woman’s touch more than I do.”
>Mionra’s eyes narrow
>”And that’s why I’m here?”
>”You got it! There’s someone with a similar taste in canines, and if it’s confidence you’re looking for, she has it in spades.”
>Guess the food’s just going to go uneaten
>”Go on,” Mionra says
>”How do you feel about Sherry-K?” Rox murmurs, trying to keep the conversation confined to the table
>Mionra blinks
>”Well....”
>”And don’t think of her as a boss. We’re talking about outside of work. First think that comes to mind.”
>Mionra bites her lip
>Her body language gave it all away
>She knows this, too, which is why the vixen’s only hope to save face is to come clean
>”She’s beautiful, she’s poised, and I love her graceful confidence. She’s near perfect, and no girl would pass up the courage to ask her out. That’s what you want to hear from me, right?”
>”Well I want to, yeah, but only if you’re being honest about it.”
>”What are you driving at, Rox? Did Petch put you up to this or something?”
>Rox huffs in frustration, then moves in closer
>Her and Rox are almost nose-to-nose at this point
>Hopefully the vixen doesn’t try to steal a kiss
>”Look, Sher needs someone in her life pretty badly. Obviously I’m spoken for, but we have an idea what kind of girl she’s looking for. Namely, you.”
>Mionra’s amber eyes grow bigger
>”Me? You’re kidding, right?”
>”No, I’m not. She wants someone with confidence just the same as you do; someone with enough pluck to stand up to her. I can tell she’s got some lofty standards for her ideal mate, and you meet them just fine. I mean....”
>Rox has a devilish look on her muzzle
>”We even asked her about you specifically. The big kitty’s got her eye on you, Mio.”
>The vixen titters coyly
>”Are you sure it’s not just because of my record? After all, I DO hold the third spot for most write-ups....”
>”Yeah, and I have the first two!” Rox says, finally digging into her food. “Really, I wouldn’t think someone like you would be so close to me!”
>Mionra twirls her fur with a sly smile
>”Well, if we’re being frank with each other, I MAY have done some of those things on purpose...to be closer to her in private.”
>Rox is practically choking on her lunch from the laughter
>”Oh, Mio. You would have saved Sher a lot of lonely nights if you just ‘fessed up sooner.”
>”Not everyone’s as bold as you, Rox,” Mionra says. “I’d even say NO ONE is. And that’s what they love about you.”
>The vixen looks to you with a mix of one-part plea and one-part threat
>The latter is significantly more prevalent
>”Treat her well, won’t you?”
>Mionra might have the potential to be even more intimidating than the tigress
>The girls finish up their meals with just a little bit of work-talk
>Then some closing business
>”Unless you go and make the first move yourself, I’ll have another chat with Sher,” Rox says. “I’ll sort something out, don’t worry. We’ll try to keep this from getting too awkward for either of you.”
>”I’d appreciate that, thanks,” Mionra says
>You say goodbye to the vixen, who leaves with a little bounce to her step
>”Cute girl. She’ll make a tiger pretty happy.”
>You expect Rox to want to ditch the park as soon as the meeting with Mionra is finished, but she isn’t so eager about leaving
>”Might have to hang around here for a while. There’s something I want to set up for tonight....”
>She definitely wants you to be curious, but she won’t show her hand (or her paw) just yet
>As the two of you mill about the Cast Complex, Rox looks at you with smugness
>”Betcha’ didn’t think I could be such a good matchmaker, huh? Now we just gotta work on Chee next.”
>Well...
>You tell Rox about your run-in with Ace before Cast Night yesterday
>”Ace? Oh, you mean Amadeus. Poor guy. What about him?”
>The pheasant had fumbled his words a bit, but the intention was fairly clear
>Rox stops cold
>”Him and...?”
>The gears are turning behind those golden eyes
>They lengthen the wolfess’ lips into a predatory smile
>It’s honestly a little terrifying
>”Oh, that’s perfect. And he even works at Whimsey Castle....”
>Rox’s claws curl around your shoulder
>”Come on, let’s go have a chat with ‘Ace’. I think I know a way we can hit two birds with one stone.”
>Or one Rox?
>...
>Yikes, now THAT’s a threatening look
>”Hey, let ME be the jokester, alright?”
>She slurps the side of your face with her tongue
>”You just worry about being the handsome one.”



[[ CHAPTER 16: Rox in the Head ]]

>With Rox’s business with Mionra completed, your visit to the Cast Complex is over
>But not your visit to the park itself
>Rox is on the hunt for someone else now
>The second shift anthros are just about to arrive for work, and Rox makes sure you’re over by the lockers waiting
>Given her excitement just a little while ago, you have a pretty good hunch who she’s looking for
>Amadeus
>Sure enough, you see the pheasant approach shortly before the hour
>His pace slows as soon as he sees you and Rox
>”O-oh, hey Anon...Rox...” he says, looking a little uncomfortable
>”Hey, Ace,” the wolfess says mischievously
>You have to admit, you’d be a little nervous too if someone like Rox was looming over you with a smirk on her face
>Though she seems to realize getting what she wants is going to be a delicate task
>”You still work over at Whimsey Castle, don’t you?” Rox continues
>”Y-yeah,” Ace says. “Up at the towers, handling the cameras and lights.”
>”Heh, what a cozy little roost that must be. You ever take anyone up there?”
>Ace rubs his shoulder with his wing
>His guilty body language isn’t too far off from someone else you know
>”Not yet. I-I mean, we’re technically not supposed to, but some of the guys have done it anyway.”
>”I see....”
>Rox has a pretty scary aura at times when things fall into place for her
>”So how do you like it here? At Whimsey World?”
>The pheasant mellows out
>”It’s great! Honestly the best job I’ve ever had.”
>”And what about Whimsey in general? You into all the movies and characters?”
>She might have pressed a little too hard there
>Ace’s neck pulls back into his body a bit in shame
>”Hey, don’t worry,” Rox says. “My roommate is fanatical about that stuff. I don’t judge.”
>”O-oh, you mean Chee?”
>That is one smug looking wolfess
>From an outsider’s view, she has the look of a wild hunter about to deliver the killing blow to her mark
>If you were in Ace’s position, however, those hypnotic golden eyes would probably blind you to any trickery going on
>”Yeah, Chee! She’s obsessed with Whimsey stuff. Probably the biggest fan of anyone in the park....”
>Well, except Sherry-K
>”...And not a lot of employees here really have the heart for all that magic anymore. She could use someone who will put up with her love of Whimsey....”
>Ace is shaking with anxiety
>Any harder and he’d start molting
>”Y-you know, I’ve been meaning to ask Chee if she wanted to h-hang out sometime. Like at Cast Night....”
>”Oh, I’m sure she’d love that,” Rox chuckles. “Why don’t I put in a good word for you? Let her know the offer’s on the table?”
>Ace opens his beak to object, but closes it with a gulp
>It’s an opportunity he knows he can’t pass up
>”Y-you’d really do that for me?”
>”Sure, why not? The girl could use someone to talk to so she’s not in my fur all the time. She’s with her parents right now, but I’ll talk to her first thing when she gets back.”
>”Awesome! I...uh, thanks a lot!”
>Rox waves it off
>”Don’t mention it. But, hey, while you’re here....”
>Oh boy, here it comes
>Rox leans on your shoulder, patting you on the chest with her paw
>”Been meaning to show Anon a great view of the park at night. Something I think they should have done for every new employee, ya know? Give them a taste of that Whimsey magic and make them proud of what they’re working for.”
>Rox’s smile grows wider as Ace’s shrinks
>”So since you work in the towers, I was wondering if you’d let us up in one of the spare rooms for a little while.”
>Ace rubs the back of his neck
>”Well, like I said, we’re really not supposed to....”
>”It’ll just be for a little while. We’ll be out before your shift’s over. And if we get caught, I’ll just tell them we snuck in ourselves.”
>Oh, great
>You were due for another close call...
>The pheasant groans with uncertainty
>”Alright, I’ll let you in,” he says, “Three of them haven’t been touched for months anyway. Just as long as you’re out by the end-of-the-day park sweep.”
>”You got it, Ace.”
>Rox clicks her tongue and gives Ace the thumbs-up
>The pheasant nods weakly as he heads into the locker rooms to get ready for his shift
>The wolfess pats you on the chest a few more times
>”Hey, don’t give me that look. You’re gonna love this, I swear.”
>She sticks her snout into your ear impishly, then licks you on the cheek
>”Just a little hint at what’s to come.”

>Once Rox is done playing matchmaker for the second time, she finally has urgency to leave the Cast Complex
>Her spirits are exceptionally high
>She’s biting her lip and fidgeting in her seat the whole car ride back to the apartment
>”Gonna need to grab a few things before we head back. We won’t leave until the evening, so we might want to take a little nap first.”
>She turns to you with a tempting look in her eyes
>”How does that sound? A little cozy time on the sofa?”
>Just thinking about that warm coat of fur makes you feel colder, with eagerness to be wrapped up in her arms
>You’re moving even faster than she is to reach the apartment as soon as the car is parked
>But she takes her time, teasing you the whole way
>Once inside, she grabs a few extra pillows and tosses them onto the couch
>”It’s been a little while since our last time sleeping on here together, huh?”
>The last time you did, it was the belly-rubbing incident
>”Ha. You got me good that night, but when I find your weakness I’m going to get my revenge.”
>From Rox, that’s definitely a promise
>She steers you over to the couch and guides you down with her
>”Don’t want you falling off, so I’m taking the outside.”
>You’re sandwiched between the cushions and Rox’s large body
>Rather than being the big spoon this time, the two of you are facing each other
>She gazes at you dreamily, then pulls your head into her neck
>From top to bottom you’re enveloped by the wolfess and the couch
>Her paws lazily rub your back as her jaw nuzzles your head
>”Sure beats sitting around doing nothing like last week, huh? Ha...ha....”
>You can feel the air flow through her body as Rox lets out a drawn-out yawn
>Guess hooking people up takes a lot out of her
>Though if what she’s said before has any truth to it, all she needs to be at ease is the thought that she’s safe with you
>Rox falls into her nap well before you do
>You’re too busy enjoying the companionship to fully nod off
>But eventually your half-lucid state is visited by a few quick dreams
>Most of them involving Whimsey World
>You and Rox wander the park grounds during a cloudless afternoon
>Among the humans, and entirely out of costume
>All the anthros are out of their disguises
>None of the other guests react to the animal people enjoying the attractions alongside them
>It’s a surreal feeling, but you keep repeating to yourself this is how it should be
>When Rox feels you stir from one of your dreams, she instinctively holds you tighter
>Hopefully her own visions are just as wonderful

>You wanted the cuddles more than the nap itself, but you still wake up feeling refreshed
>Rox does as well
>Not only that, but she’s even more excited for what’s to come
>”You wanna get cleaned up first? I’d put on something nice if I were you.”
>Well you don’t exactly have a lot of formal attire with you
>You weren’t planning on suddenly having your seasonal employment get extended indefinitely
>You throw on one of your better shirts while Rox runs around the apartment with a small bag in her paw
>She hums loudly along with the clinking of glass
>Rox launches into the bathroom as you’re finishing up getting ready
>She doesn’t make a sound for the next few minutes
>Only when the door swings open again does she announce herself with a clearing of her throat 
>Leaning against the frame is the wolfess, wearing a high-skirted, strapless dress perfectly matched to her golden eyes
>It’s not lavishly ornate, but it’s the classiest you’ve seen Rox yet
>And for someone like her, you’re glad she isn’t going overboard or too far out of character
>Rox takes your reaction well
>”Screw that fox,” she scoffs. “I can be fuckin’ feminine when I want to.”
>Well, she doesn’t carry herself any differently, dress or not
>If anything, Rox seems to be actively fighting against sophisticated behavior
>You let her know she doesn’t have to prove anything to do, especially if she’s uncomfortable because of it
>”I can tough it out for one evening,” she says confidently
>She gives a flexing pose, showing that the dress may not have been appropriately tailored for her athletic frame
>The bottom hem lifts up noticeably with the movement of her thighs, and the top visibly strains when she puffs her chest out
>”And if it gets too obnoxious, well I guess you’ll have to help me take it off then, won’t you?”
>”Obnoxious” is a pretty broad condition
>That’s without a doubt her intention, though
>Rox slaps you on the back to get you out the apartment
>”Alright, back to the park!”
>It’s the most nostalgic ride you’ve taken with Rox since that first night
>She’s excited about something, but won’t fill you in on what it is
>But unlike the confusion and disbelief of the previous time, you’re looking forward to whatever she has in store for you
>Sunset is almost over by the time you reach the Whimsey grounds
>Park the car, down through the tunnels...
>Along the way, Rox gets a few raised eyebrows and second glances
>Nobody expected to see her show up on her day off, let alone in such formal clothing
>Even carrying a bag is something she doesn’t really do
>Although you’re sure there aren’t many grooming supplies or cosmetics in it
>In the dead center of the underground is the anthro entrance to the innards of the castle
>Up the two of you go, until you’re just above the giant archways the guests can walk under
>You find Ace sitting alone beside a few monitors of the park level
>His coworkers must be on break
>”Great timing,” Rox says, vocalizing your thoughts
>”O-oh, hey. Ready to go up?” Ace says, giving Rox’s dress a once-over
>Poor guy seems perpetually nervous
>Though it may just be whenever he’s around you or Rox...
>Up some more stairs you go, until you hit the top landing of one of the towers
>Ace unlocks the door and steps out of the way
>”You, uh, might want to wait until I come get you,” he adds. “Just so you don’t run into the others on your way down.”
>”No rush,” Rox says with a wink
>The two of you are left alone in the tower room
>It’s half decorated like livable quarters, though still pretty sparse
>Simple bed, simple wardrobe, simple table and chairs, not much else
>But the view of the park is spectacular
>”They used to let guests rent these rooms out,” Rox says, setting her bag down. “But then we sort of took them over. Now they don’t get used much for anything except photos of the park and extra storage.”
>From out of the bag Rox pulls a bottle of wine and two glasses
>”Pull up a chair. The show’s about to start.”
>The cork sails across the room with a pop, drawing your attention to the scene outside
>It’s a picturesque shot of the whole park grounds, with lights glowing everywhere and happy guests milling about
>Many of them are congregating along the sides of the streets and up against buildings
>You’ve seen it happen dozens of times by now
>They’re all finding a comfortable spot for the impending fireworks
>Rox pours you a glass, while her own looks like it’s already partially empty
>”What’d I tell you? Pretty special night!”
>You barely have time to pick your glass up before she clanks hers against yours in a toast
>Then she wraps her arm around your neck to drink from
>The two of you sip at the wine for a while, exchanging fond looks
>You set aside the glasses just as music begins resonating through the whole park
>”Here we go!” Rox claps
>The amount Whimsey Corporation spends to have firework shows every single night is astronomical
>On nights when the air is still, you can even hear the booming all the way from your employee housing
>The poor anthros with sensitive hearing must have it even worse
>But whenever you get to observe the colorful displays off the clock, the enjoyment comes flooding back
>Blues and greens and reds and golds...
>Every streak of light that shoots into the room highlights Rox’s gorgeous face
>You can see a brief flash of every hue that explodes in the sky reflecting in the wolfess’ eyes
>The sense of wonder you’ve seen from Chee (and even a young Sherry-K) manages to find its way to Rox
>”It’s crazy, huh? Can’t really stay angry at the company when they can pull off stuff like this for so many people... all the time....”
>It’s true
>Even after your worst days of working in the park, there’s usually something you can find joy in eventually
>”It’s hard to keep up the bitterness forever, even when I want to hate them so much....”
>Hate?
>Rox is the polar opposite of Chee’s love for everything Whimsey, but you never thought her sentiments reached levels of hatred
>The wolfess sighs deeply
>”Maybe that’s being too rough on them. It’s not their fault I’m the way I am.”
>She picks up her glass, but after swirling it for a few moments she puts it down again
>”When the magic dies for you, you lose that innocence forever. Heh, kind of like Santa Claus, right? You can carry on the spirit and make others happy, but you’re never getting that full piece of magic back for yourself.”
>Rox’s ears droop as she stares blankly out at the fireworks
>”It happened to me right around when my parents separated....”
>It’s the first time you’ve heard about any part of Rox’s family
>Now it’s not surprising why
>”It wasn’t anything terrible, it’s just...that’s what happens, you know? Not everyone stays together forever. But it still kind of messed me up. You grow up with fairy tales and happy endings, and then you’re told none of that is real when you grow up.” 
>Her eyes close
>You don’t get to watch at the colorful reflections in them anymore
>”The last time I remember all of us truly happy, it’s when I was really little. We went to go see a movie together: a Whimsey cartoon. It was my favorite....”
>Heir of Dog?
>Rox nods
>”It’s the only one I’m able to watch without feeling beyond jaded, but after it’s over I sometimes end up feeling sick anyway. Like a night of heavy drinking. It got especially worse as I got older.”
>She inhales, but it’s a strained, choppy breath
>”You’ve seen it with me; you know how it goes. Wolf girl meets human boy. A sappy story with a sappy ending. When I was a pup I thought that could happen to me. I wanted it so bad. But if your own parents can’t hold together a relationship, what hope do I have?”
>Rox opens her eyes and looks into your own
>You can see redness and mist clouding her vision
>”You’re my first, Anon. I never had someone in my life like you before. I didn’t even try to look for anyone. I just couldn’t take that first step. I was a miserable child who turned into a miserable adult...if I can even still call myself one after how I’ve acted all this time.”
>Her face scrunches up
>She’s holding back raw emotion
>”And then...and then I met you. My life changed overnight. F-finally I met an unbelievably cool human. I did all I could to make you like me, but I knew you were going to leave soon. I let myself f-fall for someone I had no chance of ever having a lasting relationship with, whether it was because of our species differences or because of the ticking clock.”
>Rox’s expression is one of physical pain now
>Her throat must be burning
>”It was my parents all over a-again. I was losing someone I loved, and it was out of my control. I had to do something to keep you f-from leaving me. I....”
>She breaks into a distorted smile, with her nose glistening from the wetness
>”Y-you know the rest...h-h-ha....”
>You put your hands on Rox for support, and she curls her body into you
>Now it’s Rox who has her head in your chest
>”D-dammit,” she sniffs quietly. “I ruined the s-special night....”
>You pat the wolfess and rub your fingers into her neck fur
>She manages to force back her tears, even though it might have been better for her to let it all out
>But on the other hand, nobody’s supposed to cry at Whimsey World
>”I don’t want the magic to be fake anymore, Anon,” Rox croaks. “Please, don’t let me wake up and see you’re not there with me.”
>You lift her head up off your chest
>Her jaw rests in your hands as she looks at you pitifully
>When she brings her shaky paws to your neck, you move in for the kiss
>Her lips connect softly with yours, and you push into her with a stronger touch
>You need to bring out the Rox you know
>Your hands slip from around her jaw to behind her head, right to the base of her ears
>Instantly she pays you back with fervor
>Her tongue slips into your mouth while your fingers dance up her ears
>She whines and moans as you caress the back of her head
>The wolfess moves herself closer and closer
>Soon she’s up on your lap, weighing heavily on your legs
>It’s discomforting, but you’ll bear anything to make her feel the safety she needs so badly from you right now
>Her paws explore your chest and back, trying to discover your sweet spot like her ears
>Her efforts slow when she can’t find your weakness, instead resigning to enjoy the rest of the kiss
>When you finally part lips, Rox does so with a small hiccup
>It’s the last of her insecurity leaving her body
>Swept off with the wag of her tail
>With a deep breath, she stares at you with tenderness
>”Thank you, Anon.”
>You embrace one another as the fireworks escalate to their finale
>Not even the din of the explosions can dampen her words to you
>”I love you...so, so much...You’re my whole world....”
>The last of the fireworks dies out, and the crowds below start to file toward the park exit
>Rox leans her head on your shoulder as you watch the guests head home for the night
>”Just five more minutes...” she whispers
>You’re going to have to wait for Ace anyway, apparently
>”Even better,” Rox chuckles. “We’re used to little birds waking us up.”
>She tugs at your ear with her mouth
>”Won’t have that problem tomorrow, at least.”
>Guess it’s going to be another lazy day then
>Rox scratches her chin thoughtfully
>”No...it doesn’t have to be. There’s still a great place I haven’t shown you yet, and it’s right here on the park grounds.”
>There’s that grinning Rox you know all too well



[[ CHAPTER 17: Rox and Roll ]]
 
>After the last few guests make their way out of the park, Ace knocks on the door
>”Damn,” Rox says, hitting herself in the head with her paw. “We should have pretended like we were doing it....”
>She seems to be back to normal now
>The pheasant leads you back down to the castle’s tunnel entrance
>Rox gives him a pat on the back
>”Thanks again for doing that for us, Ace. Don’t worry, I’ll talk to Chee as soon as I can. Gonna see you at Cast Night sometime, right?”
>”Y-yeah, for sure!” Ace says
>Whether it’s relief at not getting caught or excitement for getting to talk to Chee (or both), Ace is visibly vibrating
>”Nice guy,” Rox says as you leave the park. “Hopefully we got a little corruption going in him. If he’s going to be hanging around Chee, he’s going to have to learn to put up with our shit.”
>Our?
>There’s no escaping it: you’re going to forever be an accessory to Rox’s mischief
>The wolfess keeps adjusting her dress as you get into the car and drive home
>Her chest bounces as she angrily pulls her top into place
>”I hate this stupid thing,” she growls. “Should have just gone in jeans and a t-shirt.”
>It still looks gorgeous on her
>But it means nothing if she isn’t happy about it
>”Thanks, Anon,” she says at your compliment. “I feel like an ass for trying to be something I’m not, though. Especially with that little meltdown of mine....”
>All in all, it needed to be done
>Rox seems happier now for getting that baggage off her chest
>And now you know what’s been eating at her all this time
>She puts a paw around your neck with a warm smile
>”There’s just one more thing to do that’s out of character for me. We’re going to be getting up early tomorrow. Hey, don’t you roll your eyes at me! Maybe not SUPER early, but still....”
>Rox drums her other paw on the wheel
>”Feels like every time we’ve hung out around the park, I ended up being a downer in some way. Not tomorrow. No crying, no buzzkills.”
>Even after parking the car, Rox keeps hold of you
>She pulls you in and mashes your cheek against hers
>”There’s no doubt you’re my boyfriend now, so I think you’re ready to see a place that’s...pretty special to me.”
>Rox’s fur tickles your face as she nuzzles you
>”This time I’m not getting dressed up or trying to prove anything to anyone else. It’s just gonna be you and me acting like our dumb selves for the whole day.”
>Back at the apartment, you head directly to Rox’s room
>It’s a little too quiet without your bird roommate ready to greet you
>But you know soon she’ll be back pestering Rox with stories of how much fun she had with her family
>It makes you feel a little uneasy, though
>How much about Rox does Chee actually know?
>Would it bum the wolfess out to hear about what a great family bonding experience her friend had?
>Guess you’ll have to cross that bridge when you come to it
>”Alright, enough of this shitty thing,” Rox says
>She draws in a huge breath and thrusts her chest forward
>Her breasts pop free, and she gives you a raunchy look
>Rox peels the rest of the dress off and tosses it sloppily into the corner of the room
>Standing in just her panties, Rox gives a few more flexes while you undress yourself
>She doesn’t give you much of a time to stare though, before she lifts you up and carries you into bed
>”Time for sleep,” she orders. “We have a lot of ground to make up for tomorrow after the crappy night we had.”
>She positions you on top of her again, and the cuddles begin
>You reassure her that it was still a nice night, all things considered
>”Well if you liked THAT shitshow, you’re going to love what I have in store for us!”
>Rox makes a raspy snicker as she rocks you on her furry body
>”Juuust wait,” she keeps repeating
>She eventually settles down, leaving nothing but intimacy
>Her breathing, her heartbeat...
>”Remember: we’re going for an endless streak here,” she whispers
>It takes you a moment to understand what she means
>Rox kisses you deeply and strokes your head
>”I love you, Anon.”
>You both fall asleep at the same time
 
>It’s the rare occasion Rox manages to wake up before you do
>Your world is flipped around as she sits up, bringing you upright along with her
>”Morrrnin’!” she says with a groan and a stretch
>Rox hops off the bed still grappling you
>You’re carried around like she’s holding her favorite toy
>Into the kitchen you go, taking a stack of waffles out of the freezer
>Chee made an overabundance of them, almost enough to last the rest of the year
>Rox gets breakfast going while still topless
>Either she’s too excited to get dressed yet, or it’s a testament to how comfortable she is with you
>Whatever the case, it’s quite the show
>One that could have gone horribly wrong if you didn’t jump in to warn her about rushing out the door without a shirt
>No matter how eager she is, Rox barely says a word to you the whole morning
>Talking to herself more than anything during the car ride
>You’re almost afraid she might have snapped after last night
>It isn’t until you make it back to the park tunnels that Rox finally reveals her plan
>She has the look of someone trying to get a bad taste out of her mouth
>”After I moped about losing innocence and all that, I realized I was looking at it too selfishly. Well, technically YOU helped me realize it. Yeah, maybe the best thing you can do from that point is to give the magic to someone else, but I didn’t stop and think that could BE the best part.”
>There’s a profound look of determination on the wolfess’ face
>”Then I thought back to last week when we were watching that film with Chee, about the big man Mr. Whimsey himself. He didn’t give a shit about making a beast of a company just for the money; he genuinely wanted to make people happy. I can respect a dream like that.”
>It feels like half the time you’ve known Rox as an anthro she’s had you pressed against her body affectionately
>She keeps you that way as you walk onward toward the backstage of “her” Cast Night ride: Rumble Rolloff
>”I forgot the whole reason I got the job here in the first place was because I thought being in the heart of all the Whimsey would make me enjoy this stuff again, like I did when I was a pup. Guess I just didn’t have a plan until now about how I was going to do that.”
>Rox puts her paw over your heart
>”And you’re the key. I need to show someone ELSE the magic to get that spark back, but I’m going to have to do it MY way.”
 
>Rumble Rolloff is one-part roller coaster, one-part log flume
>You start up on tree-covered cliffs and careen down a river to a sawmill
>It’s easily one of the most popular attractions in the park
>It also has one of the largest backstage areas for employees to operate in, with multiple control stations at various checkpoints of the ride
>It’s too complex for one anthro alone to supervise the whole thing during Cast Night, and Rox is one of several to take responsibility
>This means she knows the ride almost as well as anyone who runs it during daily operations
>That includes all the entrances and backdoors
>A handful of anthros are hard at work keeping things running as you and Rox slip in near the base of the cliffs
>A kangaroo girl looks at the two of you quizzically
>”Rox? What are you doing here?”
>”Think I left something here last Cast Night,” the wolfess says. “I’ll be out of your hair in a second.”
>The roo looks to you with even more confusion, but Rox pulls you along before she can say any more
>Most backstage areas in the park are very simple and industrial, but you wind up in a part where the ride’s theming bleeds through
>Boulders and support beams make it look like the ride caved into the tunnel
>Rox stops you next to some wooden planks jutting out from the cliff scenery
>With a quick glance around, she flips a discreet latch and folds the planks up like they were a paper fan
>It’s a narrow fit, but nothing either of you can’t handle
>It feels like you’re crawling around someplace even anthros shouldn’t be
>When the passage opens up a little wider, Rox confirms your suspicions
>”You thought it was crazy that there’s a whole secret operation humans don’t know about hidden in a theme park? Well, what if I told you there’s ANOTHER whole secret layer that most of US don’t even know about?”
>Your response is going to depend on whether or not this knowledge is going to put your life at risk again
>Rox steps out of the way so you can see where you ended up
>There’s another tunnel up ahead, but at the mouth of it is a crudely erected ticket booth
>Nailed to the top is a crooked sign
>[ ____ World]
>[The Happiest Place in the Happiest Place]
>The empty space before “World” is a powdery white smear
>As though it’s been erased and written over in chalk countless times
>The wolfess reaches behind the ticket booth and grabs a stick of the stuff
>She writes ROX in on the sign in large, thick letters
>Then she vaults over the counter and gives a flourish to the sign
>”Welcome to Rox World,” she says with a smug look. “Admission for one?”
>Yup, Rox snapped
>You might as well indulge the poor, broken girl
>At least there’s no line to this park
>As you approach the booth Rox holds out her paw
>”Ah, hang on. Sorry, but we don’t take cash or credit here. You’re going to have to pay up some other way....”
>Rox leans over the counter, presenting her cheek to you
>You give her a kiss on the side of the muzzle
>”That’ll do for now. Alright, off we go!”
>She grabs you by the hand and you both take off down the tunnel
>As Rox guides you along you notice just how much like the rest of the underground this tunnel is
>Just on a smaller, more compact scale
>But what the main underground doesn’t have is a true sense of closeness to the attractions
>Here, you can feel the rumble of the ride, smell the pines and the river waters, and hear the whistling of the wind through the rocky cliffs
>For one brief moment, you’re outside on the ride itself
>Out in the park with your closest friend, who isn’t just disguised under a costume
>You’re so close to the outside world you can even see riders sail by through little cracks and peepholes
>You can clearly make out each of their lively, joyful faces
>Such a vantage point isn’t possible even through the ride’s cameras
>It’s captivating just to watch the happy people
>Rox hangs around for a little while, but she’s soon ushering you along
>After a little walking, you end up deep within a very familiar attraction
>A very pastel, saccharine boat tour
>Little Happy Planet
>You’re looking out of little tiny windows in the ride’s background, getting another great view of the guests floating along
>It’s still Little Happy Planet though, so a bunch of guests look like they’re being tortured
>But all the reactions are candid, giving you a sense at just how much genuine emotion the ride evokes
>Fortunately, none of the droning music invades where you and Rox are
>It’s probably thanks to all the mattresses braced against the walls, dampening the sound
>This whole situation feels surreal
>It’s basically a backstage of Whimsey Park that doesn’t seem to be used by anyone
>Well, except for a wolfess and her human companion
>”Back when the park first opened,” Rox explains, “the whole place was run by mice. Whimsey himself had a pretty close mouse business partner. It worked fine for a while, but they needed more employees every time the park expanded. Most of us can’t exactly fit into the same spots mice do very well, so they had to rework the behind-the-scenes stuff to fit bigger bodies.”
>Rox leans against the mattresses as she continues to gaze out the windows
>”A lot of the tunnels that were too small, too inefficient, or too close to the humans just got sealed over. All the new ones were just built around them. Well, some of the old guard still remembered about these old secret routes....”
>You follow her to the next segment of the tunnels: a tiny break room
>There’s really only a couch, a table, and a mini fridge in here
>But also another little viewport of the outside streets
>”I don’t know who did it, but someone opened up these tunnels in a very careful way to link them all together, while still keeping them hidden from everyone else. These tunnels run through almost the whole part. Only a few employees know about this place.”
>Rox kicks open the mini fridge and tosses you a drink
>”No charge,” she laughs. “You won’t find a deal like THAT out there!”
>She gets in close, presenting her other cheek to you
>”Maybe there’s a LITTLE fee....”
>Good thing kisses are inexhaustible
>”Every time I come here all the snacks get refilled. I bring my own to add to the stash sometimes. A respectful thing, ya know? We all sort of collectively keep things running, but I always felt like someone in particular is looking out for us.”
>So an exclusive club for employees?
>Rox looks around the break room a little guiltily
>”Yeah, I suppose so. I think a lot of us who learned about this place were just pretty tired of guests or sick of management. Hell, there was a bunny coordinator who used to work here, and she’s the one who ‘initiated’ me right before she quit.”
>No doubt Sherry-K’s old friend
>The tigress probably doesn’t even know about this whole thing herself
>What about Chee?
>”I’ve...thought about bringing her here a few times. It just frankly never felt like the right time. Plus, she’s not exactly the best at keeping secrets. I’ll tell her someday.”
>Rox lifts your chin up to meet her friendly eyes
>”The way I figure it, priority goes to those who NEED to see this sort of place. People who need a bit of an escape, or to be reminded up close of what the ‘magic’ can do for others.”
>She gives you a kiss in return on the forehead
>”And maybe the boyfriends of those people as well....”
>The two of you relax and enjoy the snacks for a few minutes
>Looking around the break room, you can see signs of other employees who’ve utilized “Rox World”
>Little clumps of fur
>Bracelets and uniform ties dangling from the walls like trophies
>[cookie wuz here] written above the couch
>”I’d come here to clear my head every so often,” Rox says, “but it was always a little lonely. Never ran into any others directly. You’re the first person I’ve gotten to share this with, Anon.”
>You’ve practically become addicted to those golden eyes of hers
>They’re meant for you and you alone
>At least until they dart to the wall where a small clock hangs
>”Oh, shit!” Rox says. “It’s gonna start soon! Finish what you have and let’s roll!”
 
>Through more attractions you and Rox scurry
>You get only a moment to take each in before the wolfess yanks you along
>”We can come back later. Don’t want to miss this!”
>The innards of Whimsey Park can throw even those with the best sense of direction off
>However, you have a hunch where you might be based on your travels so far
>”Hurry up! The show’s already started!”
>You and Rox drop down a short ledge, where a few smashed-in beanbags and pillows are clustered
>There’s a wire-screen barrier in front of you, giving the perfect angle to a spotlighted stage below
>This place is immediately recognizable as the ceiling to Gallery Guffaw
>A bi-hourly comedy performance for a whole theater of guests
>Down below, two clown mascot characters are in the middle of their routine
>A parrot-like one named Chortle, and a hyena-looking one named Chide
>You can only imagine what kind of anthros are hidden inside
>”...So I said, if you fit any more in there you’d be a gumball machine!”
>Even without the setup, Rox snorts out a laugh at the delivery
>”That’s pretty good, Chortle! The last time I took a plane, someone gave me some gum to keep my ears from popping.”
>”Did it work?”
>”Yeah, but later on I couldn’t get the gum out of my ears.”
>Rox is in hysterics after every groaner and every eye-roller
>Literally howling
>She’s completely in her element here
>”Speaking of ears, I was looking to get a bunch of piercings the other day. I found a set I liked, but the seller said it was only for devout, religious types.”
>”What? Why would he say that, Chide?”
>”Because if you put them all in, you get really holey.”
>Rox hangs on to you for stability
>Your face gets wet from all the tears streaming from her eyes
>”Well, I know a pirate who does some great piercings for cheap; it’s a steal!”
>”Really? How much does he charge?”
>”A buccaneer.”
>Dead
>The jokes killed your wolfess, and she’s sprawled out on your lap
>”Anon...can’t breathe...help....”
>She shakes and wheezes
>Any time you’ve ever come to Gallery Guffaw on a day off, you’d hear raucous laughter from somewhere in the audience
>There’s always one person like that in any public gathering, but now it dawns on you
>It had to be Rox you heard in the past
>Did she ever see you down among the other humans, pretending you were right there with her?
>You stroke the prone wolfess as she fights for air
>She turns to you with watery eyes and heavy panting
>Looks like she’s going to need some CPR
>You lift her head closer to you and lock lips
>She springs to life, her tongue darting around your mouth
>The finale of the show goes ignored as Rox gives you a kiss unlike any other
>It’s an endless exchange of passion with your furry lover
>At least until she starts giggling again right into your mouth
>The theater grows quiet as the guests file out, but Rox continues to lie in your lap
>Just five more minutes, huh?
>She nods weakly
>Rox would be absolutely perfect down there on the stage
>Maybe someday when the “mascot initiative” kicks off, she will be
>Telling her favorite jokes, unfiltered because she won’t be smothered by a costume mask
>And you’ll be there for her every show
>Her biggest fan



[[ CHAPTER 18: Roxie IV ]]

>You’ve had more fun in Rox World than you’ve ever had in Whimsey World
>The only way things could be the other way around is if you were allowed to enjoy the rest of Whimsey with her
>You’d say “maybe someday”, but who knows when such a future will be possible?
>But if working for the company has taught you anything, it’s not to focus on the ugliness of reality all the time
>The best you can do right now is just enjoy what you have in front of you
>After Rox recovers from Gallery Guffaw she continues taking you on a tour of the secret tunnels
>Though she’s going to need to take a breather after laughing so hard
>You were fine just relaxing with her up in the Gallery’s hidden perch, but she has a different spot in mind
>A few ideas crop up as you travel farther through the park
>Now you’re very close to “E-on-Time”, where all the futuristic rides and shows in the park are
>It starts to get darker the further you go underground
>When you hear the din of the ride you instantly know where you are
>Starlight Summit
>It wasn’t that long ago you were here with Rox enjoying the attraction with her
>Now you’re seeing it from a different perspective
>Seeing HER from a different perspective
>No longer under the disguises of mascot character and handler
“This’ll do,” Rox says as she guides you to a spot where a few blankets are already spread out
>As the two of you two lie together in the underbelly of Starlight Summit, it really feels like the two of you are on a genuine vacation together
>You and Rox are far under the tracks of the coaster ride, side by side
>The occasional rumble of the carts above sounds almost like the roar of ocean waves
>You can see up through the tracks well enough to take in the dim lights of the high ceiling
>Like looking at a starlit night
>Rox’s plan worked perfectly
>She managed to show you the magic you didn’t even realize you needed in your life
>Whenever you walked around Whimsey Park, you always honed in on what was “fake”
>Staring at zippers on costumes, or finding all the joints and hydraulics of animatronics
>The kind of thing guests blissfully ignore so they can make the most of the experience
>Here in Rox World, it’s the opposite
>You can look past all the gates and screens to see the inner charm of the amusement park
>Yeah, you’re technically lying on the floor of a ride’s basement, looking at ceiling lights and pretending they’re stars
>And somehow you’re perfectly fine believing in the illusion
>Rox’s paw sneaks over to your hand and squeezes it
>It’s pretty dark down here, but you can easily make out her shining golden eyes
>”Hey...ya’ have a good time today?”
>How can you say no?
>Rox grins proudly
>”Yeah, I knew you would.”
>Another cart races by, like a shooting star against the night sky
>Rox fidgets, rubbing her legs together
>There’s a lengthy silence before the wolfess speaks again
>”Just the two of us gazing up at the stars. I guess this is the kind of clichéd thing that makes people start talking about dreams like in all the movies, right?”
>She snickers to herself
>Though it’s clear she was setting herself up for this moment
>”To tell you the truth, I don’t know if I have any anymore,” she says bluntly.
>Her paw moves from your hand to rub up and down your arm
>”Yeah, I had goals and stuff, but the only real dream I had was...to meet a human.”
>She moves from your arm up and around your shoulder, pulling you closer
>Her fur is infinitely warmer and softer than the worn out blankets you’re lying on
>When she speaks, you can feel her words reverberate through her neck
>”No, not just that. My DREAM was to fall in love with one, and maaaybe have one feel the same about me. But I’m sure you already knew that.”
>Rox hums to herself happily as you’re pulled even tighter against her
>”So now I have everything I wanted. Where do I go from here? I mean there’s a lot for us to look forward to with the mascot initiative and meeting Mr. Whimsey....”
>She scratches you absentmindedly
>”Do we go even bigger? Like, try to bring this kind of happiness to everyone else? How many others out there do you think want to have the kind of relationship we have?”
>It’s pretty much just Rox thinking aloud
>You can tell she’s feeling a little lost
>Surely if you suddenly find yourself having what you wanted most, you’re going to need some time to find the next big thing
>Rox backs off a bit
>Even with the lack of light you can see the obvious guilt in her face
>Her pointed ears fold back
>”I didn’t...keep you from your own dreams, did I?”
>Her paw disconnects from your body, as though she’s afraid to touch you anymore
>”I know I screwed you over and got you stuck in all this mess. It’s a miracle you don’t hate my guts because of all that. But even worse, I didn’t stop and think about whatever future you would have had.”
>Rox shrinks away
>”Did you have dreams? Did you have...a girlfriend back home?”
>It’ll soon be two weeks since you first discovered the anthros
>Despite all that time, things have been such a whirlwind of surprise and activity you still feel like you haven’t had time to sit back and think about your life
>What plans did you have before coming to Whimsey World?
>Not many apparently, or else you wouldn’t have taken this seasonal job to begin with
>It would have looked great on your resume to work for such a reputable, behemoth of a company
>Yet you didn’t exactly have anyone lined up career wise to even look at it
>Maybe it was something you did simply BECAUSE you were at a loss for what direction to take your life
>A lot of others in your life have always said they didn’t know what job they’d end up doing
>An unusual opportunity opened up, and they went for it
>You weren’t planning on discovering a secret population of animal people who would flip your world upside down, but that’s what the universe decided to unload onto you
>Yeah, you’re essentially stuck with them until they trust you well enough to give you more freedom
>But you aren’t a slave and you aren’t being tortured
>If you can still consider yourself a prisoner, it’s the best prison you could be in
>So what are your dreams right now?
>Who knows
>There’s no rush, and there’s no pressure to decide right now
>There’s just a worried wolf girl lying next to you, terrified of the answer you might give her
>Rox flinches when you suddenly move, but when you close the distance between the two of you again her she melts in your arms
>Her dreams are as good as yours at this point
>Not to mention, what girlfriend could ever be as good as a wolf girl?
>”H-ha hah...you are such an awesome guy, Anon,” Rox says happily
>Back in her embrace you’re assaulted with head rubs and cheek nuzzles
>”I didn’t even follow my own rules,” she laughs. “No buzzkills. There isn’t even anything left to sweat about anymore, at least between us.”
>She continues her aggressive, affectionate contact
>The smell of her fur sweeps into your nose
>Her hairs brush against your skin with an electrifying tingle
>When she lets up, her legs are still rubbing together
>A clatter echoes not too far from where you are
>You and Rox freeze up, trying to locate the source
>”Pfft, it’s nothing,” Rox laughs
>She crawls over to where the sound came from and holds up a pair of sunglasses
>”We TELL them to secure their shit before the ride starts. They just never listen.”
>Rox slips the sunglasses into her pocket as she rejoins you
>”They’re pretty beat up after that, but someone will be looking for them anyway. We’ll drop them off at the Lost and Found before we leave. Do our good deed for the day.”
>Still on her paws and knees, Rox wiggles her backside and tries to keep her legs from touching
>Rox grunts as she fidgets some more
>”Well, I think we’ve...guh...done just about everything here. W-what do you say we head back home soon?”
>You’re a little surprised by her abrupt change in plans
>Wasn’t this supposed to be an all-day thing?
>”Hey, you know what they say, right? ‘Can’t see all of Whimsey in just one day’, r-right? Hah....”
>Rox helps you to your feet, but it’s her who looks like she’s having a difficult time standing
>”I’m thinkin’ ramen and just kicking back on the couch. Huh? Maybe we can raid Chee’s movie collection for something to watch together.”
>To say Rox is acting odd would be an understatement
>Especially if she’s suggesting watching one of her roommate’s many Whimsey movies
>Past Starlight Summit are a few more tunnel crossroads leading to other attractions, but Rox steers you away from them
>”Next time,” she says. “Gotta leave something for us to come back to.”
>You managed to loop back around to where you started the day
>Rox hastily wipes away her chalk name from the [ ____ World ] sign
>Then she pulls a notebook from behind the ticket booth and scribbles something down
>It’s a guest book
>You can see her name and yours added to dozens—if not hundreds—of others
>Many are repeats, but there’s a noticeable variety
>”Alright, we’ll drop off the sunglasses and head back home.”
>The wolfess slams the notebook shut and slaps you on the back before tossing it aside with an unusual smirk on her face
>”Well? Let’s move!”

>You’re soon out of Rox World, and then out of the rest of the park
>It’s getting late in the afternoon, though still a little too early yet for dinner like Rox suggested
>Her face looks numb with a forced smile as you’re led to the car and driven to the apartment
>It’s frozen in an even more creepy expression than half of the mascot masks
>The ride back is a rocky one
>The rapid bouncing of her leg on the accelerator makes the car lurch forward sporadically
>She plays the radio along the way, but her humming is completely out of sync with every song 
>When the car parks back at the employee housing she’s already outside your door
>Ready to throw it open before you can even grab the handle
>Then it’s back to being shoved ahead the rest of the way
>But once you pass through the doorway of the apartment, Rox mellows out
>Too much so
>You and Rox stare at each other for an uncomfortably long time
>She gives a short, awkward laugh every so often
>”I, uh...did you have a good time today?”
>Guess we’re doing this conversation again
>”A-ah, sorry, sorry. Just got a little scatterbrained for a second there.”
>The wolfess takes a few unnaturally large breaths, exhaling sharply each time
>Her composure normalizes
>”Look,” she grumbles
>There’s strain in her voice
>”I gotta come clean, Anon. I wanted this day to be the absolute best for both of us, and I was hoping we could end it with...you know...YOU KNOW....”
>Oh
>She lowers her head sheepishly
>”Anon, I know you know how I feel about you. And I KNOW you caught me doing some...embarrassing things in private, while thinking of YOU.”
>It was definitely a surprise to hear her calling out your name when she was “working out” in her room
>Pretty flattering, too
>Her foot lifts off the floor briefly as her knees rub together
>”I’ve had fantasies of us together probably a lot sooner than it was safe to. I guess that naïve little pup Rox still hung on to that ‘love at first sight’ crap after all these years.”
>Poor Rox
>It’s more than a little heartbreaking to think she had to get by for so long with just fantasies of the two of you, rather than being able to fully confide her feelings
>”After you helped me blow off a little steam last week when you accidentally...heh...I thought I could stay resilient for a while after that. Got it out of my system, you know? But like an idiot I pushed things ahead too quickly.”
>Her paws clench and unclench as though imitating her heartbeat
>”Throwing myself on you, getting all handsy, sleeping half naked together...man, I really wasn’t making this whole ‘taking things slow’ easy, was I?”
>Rox gulps audibly
>”When I said it was my dream to fall in love with a human, I meant taking things ‘all the way’ eventually. But...I knew if I blew it with you I’d never get another chance, so I kind of...suppressed some urges.”
>The wolfess claws at her sides
>”I know I’ve asked you this already, but...do you have those feelings for me, Anon? Like, THOSE feelings? Would you really be alright having an actual relationship with a wolf? Or...should we just stick to ear scratches and belly rubs? B-because I can totally make that work! Really! Whatever it takes for us!”
>Rox hit you with a lot to take in very quickly
>There’s no sense in lying to yourself about your feelings for her
>You can confidently say you love her, and any hesitation in moving things forward came mostly from her
>It was probably a mature, well-intended gesture on her part
>Even it drove her a little stir-crazy as a result
>But the two of you have been through so much these last few months it feels like it’s about time for you to look ahead to the next step
>So you tell her exactly what she’s been hoping to hear
>You truly love her, and you’d like nothing more than to see your relationship get even stronger
>The wolfess hyperventilates before clapping her paws with an excited yip and a short hop in place
>Composure’s out the window, but at least it’s Rox being her expressive self again
>”H-ha! Well...now I don’t know what to do with myself!”
>She’s back to fidgeting
>This time it seems to be more because of a lack of direction where to go from here
>”Sooo...are you, ya’ know, in the mood right now?”
>It’s not how you expected this to play out as your first time with her
>Being the goof she is, you shouldn’t have expected anything else
>”Hey, don’t give me that look,” she huffs. “I told you I’ve never had a boyfriend before. Cut me some slack. I know I talk a big game, but that was to save face around you all this time.”
>Rox scratches her neck fluff shamefully
>”I dunno. Maybe we should just stick to belly rubs. I don’t know what the hell I’m doing.”
>One step at a time, you tell her
>Every bold move she’s made before was done exactly when she felt it was ready
>Though maybe you can help her feel a little more comfortable by taking the initiative
>You start with what you know: scratches
>The two of you make your way to the bedroom, with you guiding the wolfess there by her ears
>You lower yourselves down as the scratches continue
>*scritch scritch scritch*
>”Getting there...” Rox says with a groan
>Her head rolls and twists so you can cover all the spots
>A shiver courses through her as you hit all the key spots
>When she’s had enough she backs up from your reach
>She grabs her top and pulls it over her head with a smooth motion
>Her breasts are released with a jiggle, on full display for you once more
>You join her by removing your own shirt
>”Well, we made it this far again,” she says with a grin
>You place your hands on her stomach, and the wolfess immediately tenses her abdomen
>”A-alright, maybe don’t go as crazy this time. Just...easy.”
>You rub her belly up and down gently
>This loosens her up considerably
>Her eyes begin to close in a dreamy, hypnotic way
>Her mouth hangs open as she pants slowly
>You can bring her so much pleasure through belly rubs it’s difficult not to go overboard
>You work your fingers into her fur, down to the skin underneath
>Your thumbs tease her navel for a while before your hands spread out to her waist
>Rox’s tongue oozes out with bliss
>”I...Anon...uhhhooo....”
>Her noises are like a young pup trying to howl for the first time
>The stimulation culminates with a powerful inhale and more tensing
>Rox grabs you hands to hold them still
>It’s like she’s holding her breath
>Then she sighs longer than you’ve ever heard her before
>You’re left to watch as Rox stands up from the bed and unbuttons her jeans
>She hooks her claws into the waistband of her jeans and closes her eyes with another shorter sigh
>Rox slides her pants off, showing you her fully naked body at long last
>Nothing’s out of the ordinary—at least by wolf standards—and it’s everything you would have imagined from Rox’s athletic body
>But she’s gorgeous nonetheless
>You can barely make out the swell of her netherlips through the fur of her groin, with a visible slickness to it
>Her eyes flutter open, and her smile returns
>Whether by shyness or tantalization, she turns to the side with her arms folded and her tail swaying
>”Are we cool?” is all she can say, in her typical Rox fashion
>Definitely
>Rox swivels on her toes, letting you see every angle of her
>”Okay, now I’m completely at a loss what to do next.”
>Guess it’s your turn
>You disrobe the rest of your clothes with a steady pace
>The more you remove, the wider Rox’s eyes get
>Now the both of you are in the buff, looking over the other with exploring gazes
>When you make your way up to her golden eyes, she gives you a goofy thumbs-up
>”I’m liking what I see so far,” she chuckles
>Ditto
>Neither of you makes the next move
>Someone needs to go first, and the ball’s up in the air
>It’s going to have to be you
>But the moment you move, Rox jumps back a bit
>”I’m not gonna lie, Anon,” Rox says with a grimace, “maybe we’re a little TOO cool. I’m actually getting cold feet here, h-ha.”
>Her confession throws you off
>She admitted herself she’s been pretty brazen about throwing herself on you
>Now there’s hesitation out of nowhere
>Is it because of you?
>Your body?
>Rox can sense your disappointment
>”H-hey, it’s nothing, really! It’s just...I’m....”
>She tugs on her ears and bites her gums
>”You want something to eat first? I can get that ramen going!”
>She doesn’t wait for an answer
>Rox bolts from the room, with her furry rump and tail bouncing with every step
>You hear the rattle of pots and pans from the kitchen
>Followed by clacks of stove dials and the rushing of the sink
>Her behavior makes you speechless
>And at the same time, it’s entirely normal
>If there’s one thing Rox has always been consistently, it’s unpredictable



[[ CHAPTER 19: House of Rox ]]
 
>Rox continues to make noise in the kitchen as you sit on the bed stunned
>You and her were staring at each other’s nude bodies with anticipation for what was about to come next
>That was mere seconds ago
>Then she backed out before you even had time to process her change of heart
>She said it wasn’t you, but what else could it be?
>Where’s the Rox who whipped off her shirt without warning to snuggle you with her bare chest?
>The Rox who dragged you into the women’s locker room the first time you found out she was a wolf and changed clothes right in front of you?
>Cooking ramen, apparently
>The two of you are all alone in the apartment, but if she was so spooked by you you’re not going to walk around with your junk hanging freely
>You throw some underwear on and head to the kitchen
>The wolfess must have had similar fears about being in the buff, because she has an apron on to cover her body
>Or at least her front
>In a way, seeing her with the thin layer of cloth draped over her is enticing on its own
>She has an assembly line of ramen to keep her busy
>”H-hey Anon,” she says with an uneasy smile. “How many packs of noodles do you want? Two? Four? Ten?”
>She tears another one open and adds it to the pile
>You tell Rox to chill out with all the ramen
>Not only are you not going to be able to eat it all, but that’s practically Rox’s entire food budget
>She sighs in defeat
>”Yeah, I freaked out a bit. I’m...sorry, Anon.”
>She stacks the ramen bricks distractingly
>The boiling water in the pot hisses into steam, completely ignored
>”I guess I wasn’t as ready to dive in and bear it all for you as I thought I was....”
>She flattens out her apron to highlight her point
>”I felt even more naked than I expected. I still kinda feel that way. When all your emotions for someone build up inside of a costume, you sort of feel protected by the stupid outfit. Like it’s your second skin. Like if you fell for me, I’d still be in the costume.”
>Rox picks at her nails, doing anything she can to not look you directly in the eyes
>”You know, in my fantasies—before I showed you my real self—I imagined that if we DID ever go at it I’d basically be humping you in that very costume. I still couldn’t tell you what I was, but I could get away it somehow.”
>She laughs in a forced, anxious way
>”Imagine that. I’d be in some kind of fur suit the whole time. Pretty weird, huh? Ha....”
>Rox keeps avoiding your eyes while she talks, but instead stares down at your underwear
>Her breathing is heavy, and you can see her fleshy nubs poke through the apron as her chest heaves
>”We both want this, right? I was a puss back there, and it wasn’t fair to lead you on just to bail out at the last second.”
>You feel like she might be getting a little too hard on herself
>It IS your first time with her, after all
>And your first time with an anthro, obviously
>It’s a heavy moment for both of you
>”I guess it’s just me being kind of afraid. We can’t get much closer than...sex, right?“
>Just the word itself makes Rox jittery
>Rox has never been so blunt about it before
>”I just don’t want to ruin what we have going for us if I fuck things up...ha...for real. At least if we had to do in in the suit there would have been that, well, ‘mystery’ I suppose. I’d still have something left to show you and maybe redeem myself with, if that makes sense.”
>Would she like it better that way?
>”What, in the costume? No...that’s dumb. I guess it boils down to taking the plunge and figuring things out later.”
>Rox’s ears perk up
>”Speaking of boiling, I guess we might as well chow down while we have all this ramen going already.”
>All of it?
>”Nah, I’ll bag the rest back up. That stuff’s like gold around here. Well, at least for me. But, hey, don’t get changed just yet.”
>Rox pulls the strings of her apron and throws it off of her
>Once again entirely nude
>”I got too comfortable in my costume. Little by little I tried to peel it away and find the guts to get to this point. Now I want to be comfortable like this.”
>The wolfess poses for you with some subtle flexing
>You can make out the definition of her toned muscles through all the fur
>”So until we hit the bedroom again, I’m going to stay like this.”
>Rox finishes cooking the hearty ramen meal
>Rather than eat at the table she takes the food over to the couch
>When she sits down she shifts her legs just the right way to give you a brief look at her puffy lower lips
>Her previous hesitation is probably why you think that her flashing you is just an accident
>But when she gives you a wickedly smug look you see the error of your ways
>Every time she leans down to slurp up some more of her ramen she gives your tenting underwear a prolonged look
>”Hey, we should do that noodle thing like in the movies!”
>That’s a pretty direct segue
>Does she mean taking opposite ends of a noodle and working your way to the center?
>Seems like a lot of work for a kiss you could just share normally, but...
>Before you can finish your thought Rox grabs a wad of ramen with her mouth
>She then mashes it against your own and tries to shove the noodles inside with her tongue
>You work through the mouthful while Rox laughs
>”Sorry. Always wanted to try that!”
>She has a strand of ramen draped over her snout, which you pick off and feed to her
>When the bowls are empty, Rox assesses the damage
>”Man, we got pretty dirty today. Rolling around in those tunnels, and now I’m covered in flavor-packet powder.”
>Rox gathers the bowls and tosses them into the sink
>The sway of her tail draws your attention to her furry bottom
>”How about we clean up with a shower?”
>She’s getting that confidence back for sure
 
>You’re pushed into the waiting bathroom
>Rox turns on the water and snaps your waistband
>”Alright, in we go!”
>Now you’re joining her in the buff
>The water feels much hotter than the dial shows, but that could be the blood coursing through you
>And it’s not difficult to see why
>Naked with the wolfess in all her natural beauty
>The shower dousing her fur somehow draws out the wild wolf in her even more
>You both soak for minutes, taking in each other’s body
>Rox stares at one spot in particular
>She reaches down with a nervous paw and cups your scrotum
>She plays with its weight and rolls it along her fingers
>The leather pads of her paws is a sensation unlike any other
>If there was any room left in your erection for more blood, it’s full now
>Rox handles it next, gliding ever so gently up and down
>”I know I’m one of the weird ones,” she says with a whistle, “but you humans gotta have the best packages out there. Nothing sharp, nothing funny looking...”
>Even compared to wolves?
>”Like I said, I’m not normal. Some of us just have this...fixation with humans, I suppose. Wolves just don’t do it for me, and nothing else does either.”
>Rox squeezes you the entire time she talks
>Continuing to do so even as she grabs some soap, presses your back to her front, and begins washing your body
>She rests her head on your shoulder as she scrubs everywhere
>It’s a heavenly feeling to be embraced by your wolfess and washed all the while
>With warm water cascading all over you
>You have to warn Rox to ease up a bit on fondling, though
>As much as you want to give yourself over to the pleasure, you want to save yourself for the bedroom even more
>”Sure thing,” she purrs
>She slows her stroking down, but still gives your length a squeeze every so often to tease you
>You’re afraid she’s going to get you off too soon right as she lets go of your entirely
>”My turn.”
>The wolfess has a lot of fur to work through
>It takes a while to lather her up and rinse her down, but it’s an enjoyable process
>”Ooo~ooo~ooohhh,” she sighs. “I think I found something even better than belly rubs....”
>When you get to the small of her back, Rox’s tail whips you excitedly
>You grab the base and hoist it out of the way so you can work on her rump
>Rox lets out a sharp gasp
>You might have found something that disarms her faster than belly rubs, too
>She braces herself against the wall as you knead her cheeks and thighs
>Not to clean them anymore, but instead as payback for the teasing
>”What are you d-doing back there?” she groans. “Hurry up and finish already!”
>She swats you again with her tail as soon as you release it
>With the two of you clean, you move on to drying yourselves
>Rox’s blower makes this part no trouble at all
>She’s floofed up a bit once you’re done, but her fur settles with some quick brushing
>The wolfess runs her body all over you even after you’re fully dry
>”Just warming you up some more,” she snickers
>The double entendre is not lost on you
 
>After eating and bathing, it’s getting late in the evening
>You and Rox are sitting together on the bed quietly
>”Sooo...you think we should get some drinks in or something? Loosen up a bit?”
>Alcohol seems to be in as limited of supply as ramen in the apartment
>”Ah, scratch that. If we’re gonna do this, I don’t want to be inebriated and screw things up even worse.”
>Rox sighs with the tension of someone about to jump out of an airplane
>”Well, you ready?”
>She sounds so morose about it
>You let her know that, yes, you’re ready
>Rox grabs your head and locks her lips with yours
>It’s such a powerful, aggressive kiss you’re afraid she’s literally trying to eat your face
>You have the wind knocked out of you from how fast it happens
>Any air you can take in is immediately stolen by Rox’s sucking
>You hang on to whatever fur you can, but Rox reroutes your hands to her torso
>One hand is placed on a breast while the other is led to her stomach
>Your hands instinctively rub and grope, trying to make the wolfess happy
>She makes little noises into your mouth as you continue to massage her, ending the kiss with a wet pop
>Her fingers dance along your skin, just as unsure where to cling to
>Her body tenses after taking all the rubs she can handle, and she pushes you onto your back
>”A-alright, just a bit more p-prep work....”
>Rox buries her snout into your groin and sniffs deeply
>That alone is practically enough to keep you rigid, but she proceeds to lick up your length in thorough strokes
>She coats it in as much of her saliva as she can, though not without savoring the taste
>Or at least the sounds she makes lead you to believe she likes the taste
>As one paw grips your shaft, the other digs into her own loins
>Evidently trying to escalate things for both of you at once
>You’re afraid she’s going to edge you too close just like in the shower, but she’s much quicker to ease off this time
>Though she rubs herself a little while longer while she speaks
>”How are we going to do this?” she grunts.
>Talking out loud more than to you
>“I don’t want to...h-hah...crush you.”
>Sounds like you’re going to have to be on top, if that’s possible with her
>You’re yanked to your feet as Rox flops onto the bed in your place
>Her waist barely hangs over the end of the bed as she lies on her back
>With a gulp, Rox spreads herself
>Her netherlips are swollen even more than before, and warmth can be felt pouring out of her
>You place your hands on her hips and she hooks her legs over your shoulders
>The wolfess can do no more now except nod weakly
>You guide yourself into her, easing through her heated folds
>For how much bigger she is than you, it’s still a remarkably tight fit
>Rox pants frantically, causing you to slow down out of concern
>But her legs pull you closer
>Slowly you fill her up, little by little
>When you’re all the way in, Rox puts her paw close to her groin
>As if hoping to feel where you are inside of her
>Her laughing is broken, but it’s unmistakably out of satisfaction
>”Hah...hah...did it...” she gasps
>Well, not quite
>She knows that too
>The two of you begin rocking in unison
>Easy and calm at first, but building up in speed and intensity in seconds
>You’re given a moment to pull yourself out a slight amount before her legs draw you back in
>It almost becomes a fight just to move away, and with her powerful physique it’s a fight that’s in her favor
>When you falter and can’t pull yourself back for a moment, Rox grinds against your hilt for as long as it takes for you to recover
>It’s eagerness that becomes her downfall, however
>After a short time, her eyes go wide
>Her body spasms and the wolfess makes noises that are very familiar to you
>”A-A-AHH...HAAOOOooohhh,” she howls
>You give her some time to come back down
>Only for her to shake her head violently when you wait too long
>”N-NO! Keep going! I can...I can hold out longer this t-time!”
>She’s so sensitive to any kind of stimulation that you’re not surprised how quickly you got her to climax
>But she’s egging you on and a kindled spirit within you accepts the challenge
>You redouble your efforts to overcome Rox’s hardening defenses
>The large, powerful wolfess against a mere human
>A mere human who knows all her weaknesses
>Again and again you thrust against her, aided by her legs
>She growls with feral determination
>But her rough grunts turn into whines as you gain the upper hand
>Her paws fly to her chest, squeezing her breasts and flicking her nipples with her thumbs
>With just a few pumps more, Rox hits orgasm a second time
>And again you pause, standing over her like a wrestler over his defeated opponent
>”Nggahh...Ah...a-again...keep going....”
>She isn’t trying to prove her fortitude anymore
>You realize she’s holding out simply because she’s waiting for you to get your own pleasurable finish
>It’s frankly a miracle you lasted as long as you have with how good her body feels
>No, it’s something more than that keeping you stalwart
>You’re empowered by the desire to give Rox all she wants
>You’re better than a male wolf in her eyes, and you’re going to prove her right
>Her legs fall from your shoulders as you lean into her more
>Your hands rest on her abdomen and you curl your fingers into her fur
>Thrusting into her while simultaneously working over her belly
>It’s the coup de grace
>The ultimate sensory overload for the wolfess
>If only you had an extra pair of hands to scratch her ears too
>Rox tries vainly to lift her legs back up, but she can only squeeze her knees together around you feebly
>She grabs your forearms as firmly as she can, both to keep you supported over her and to help you find her sweet spots
>Pinned to the bed, Rox can only beg for you to oblige her needs
>You hold off your own mounting climax as long as possible, but you’ve already reached the summit
>In your final, fervent thrusts, Rox spasms for a third time
>Her body shudders as you release
>The wolfess locks up as you pour into her, constricting you with her quivering folds
>Thoroughly spent, prone and eyes glazed over
>You stand over her as your own adrenaline depletes
>When you’re ready, you slowly pull out
>Days of tension and flirting made you more pent up than you’ve ever been before
>Culminating in something that you can be pretty damn proud of
>Rox might be regretting how much she teased you, if her mind is working at all right now
>You’re actually starting to get a little worried for the motionless wolfess
>Until she snaps to life
>She gasps as though taking her first breath after a threat of drowning
>Suddenly reanimated, Rox spends the last reserves of her energy to kick off the floor and move farther onto the bed
>Pulling you up and on top of her
>You’re rested on your wolfess just as you have been in past nights
>Her breathing is so deep you’re lifted high up with every inhale she takes
>Her paws rub all over your body as if checking to make sure you’re all there
>Her breasts cusion your head, limbs tangled into one another
>Fur matted down by your sweat
>On the verge of unconsciousness, Rox fights to stay awake just a moment longer
>”Nn...nnahh...” she pants
>No...?
>”Nnnoo...have t...luh...love....”
>She’s trying keep her record going
>An “I love you” every night, just as she promised
>You place a hand on her muzzle and a kiss on her lips
>Reassuring her that you accept her efforts
>A smile grows on her face at your touch
>With her duty complete, Rox lets herself be taken by sleep
>Her breathing returns to normal, and her wandering paws rest peacefully
>You grab as much of the bedsheets as you can to pull over your bodies
>The clock shows that it’s still early in the night, but the set alarm warns you about your shift tomorrow
>Hopefully you can get Rox out of bed on time
>Especially since you’ll be needing to clean yourselves up again
>With how much better a lot of anthros’ senses are you don’t want to go to work with the lingering musk of your deeds
>Knowing Rox, she’d probably risk it
>Parading you around like some sort of conquest
>With the happy smile still on her face, you imagine she’s already planning the very same thing



[[ CHAPTER 20: Alternative Rox ]]

>The alarm goes off before you know it
>You must have really been out cold
>You try to reach the buzzer, but your arms are a little tied up
>Still tangled with the wolfess beside you
>The sheets are in complete disarray and Rox’s tongue is hanging out
>Kind of an unflattering scene
>And yet, it’s a gorgeous sight to have first thing in the morning
>Rox’s disheveled fur shows the aftermath of the wild lovemaking you had
>Her natural, unclothed body is a reminder of the intimacy you shared and how comfortable you are with each other
>You can’t help but see something different in the wolfess
>It’s as though the last of her worries and insecurities were visibly shed away with her clothes
>You’re both adults, but it feels like Rox somehow matured even more overnight
>She stirs awake when you shut off the alarm
>She takes a moment to comprehend what happened, then breaks into a raunchy grin
>The sheets whip around as her tail wags
>”Hoo, what a rush! Gotta say, that was everything I hoped for.”
>She scoots a little closer and strokes your face with her paw
>You can see deeply into her golden eyes, as though they can lead you to her heart
>”You were amazing, Anon. You took charge, you kicked me into gear, and...well, I wish I could remember more of it near the end there....”
>Rox’s nostrils flare as she sniffs the air
>”Wow. That’s, heh, pretty potent stuff. Might need to get cleaned up a bit before heading out. Unless...you want me to take you around the park with my scent all over you!”
>You sure called that one
>Rox gives you a few licks on the face that soon turn into longer kisses
>”I won’t do that to you. I’m sure it’s widely known by now that the two of us are a thing, but I don’t want to go announcing to everyone that we fucked.”
>Rox puts a paw to her muzzle, like a child who just realized she said something naughty
>But that quickly turns back to a prideful grin once more
>”Honestly never thought I’d be saying that without it being a joke or something. Man, now I really HAVE gotten everything I dreamed of!”
>She rubs all over you, continuing to lick and sniff your body to examine her handiwork
>”Though I guess it’s not perfect QUITE yet. I, uh, might not be telling my folks about us for a while. Not that I have the closest relationship with either of them anyway....”
>It didn’t dawn on you much until now just how rare it must be for an anthro to have sex with a human
>Surely nobody else in the whole park can brag about that
>Life might get more difficult for the two of you if your relationship caused uproar
>”I’m more worried about the jealousy,” Rox chuckles. “There might not be many of us human-ophiles around here, but if they know you’re fine with banging one you’re going to get preyed on. Trust me.”
>Rox clamps her mouth on your neck with a playful growl
>”Just remember what I said: you’re MY Anon. All mine!”
>She pulls you to your feet, giving your nude body a smirk
>Then she looks back to the damage you’ve caused on the bed
>”It’s a good thing Chee’s not coming back until tomorrow. We’re gonna have to get rid of the evidence. Hopefully we can hit the laundry room without anyone else noticing either.”
>Rox ushers you into the bathroom where she kicks on the shower
>Not even half a day ago you were bathing together like this
>”It’ll be faster this way,” she tells you, lathering you up
>It’s still pretty arousing to have the wolfess’ paws explore your body—and to see hers on full display—but after the bonding you did it’s easier to keep things under control
>You’ve become so attuned to each other now
>What a crime it is to have to disguise her beauty with those ratted, ugly costumes
>But it only makes her true self even more attractive when the outfit is finally stripped away
>A minute goes by before you realize Rox stopped cleaning you
>She’s holding you in her arms, swaying your bodies together
>”We’ll have time every morning to do this kind of thing if we share a shower,” she hums into your ear
>Chee might get suspicious that the two of you are constantly in the bathroom together
>”I’ll figure something out. Who knows, maybe if we can find her a little friend of her own, she’ll fly the nest.”
>It makes you a little sad to think of Chee not being your roommate anymore
>Rox sighs
>”Yeah, I guess that would be a bummer. I’ve known her for so long it wouldn’t feel right not to have her around.”
>She rubs your chin like it were her own as she thinks out loud
>”I still want to pair her up with a nice guy, though. She’s too sweet to be a third wheel. I think I might have an idea how to do it, AND get a certain kitty involved at the same time.”
>There’s a twinkle in Rox’s eyes

>After such an eventful weekend it almost feels good to return to work
>In some ways, it feels like you’re working at Whimsey for the first time
>Rox has a smile on her face the whole way to the park
>That’s already a nice change of pace for her
>But what’s even more unusual is the way she carries herself
>The wolfess has her head held high and her chest puffed out
>Confidence exudes from her
>Her motions are stronger and her presence feels bigger
>What has gotten into her?
>Well if you asked her that, she’d probably let you know exactly what it was that “got into her”
>Along with a nudge to your ribs and a raised brow
>She’s so pleased with herself you worry that might actually get her into trouble
>Especially when a certain tigress comes around the corner of the employee tunnels
>”Morning, Sher!” Rox calls out loudly
>”Roksa,” Sherry-K nods in acknowledgment. “You seem...complacent today.”
>”Suppose I’m just in a damn fine mood!” Rox laughs
>”Yes, well, I’m happy to hear that.”
>”Aww, thanks Sher!”
>The tigress continues on her way before Rox slides in front of her
>”Don’t you want to hear about my weekend?” Rox says
>Oh boy
>You know she wouldn’t spill the beans, but you’ve gotten more than your share of surprises the last couple of days
>”Not particularly, no,” Sherry-K says flatly
>”Hey now, is that really how our friendship is going to be? I did something the other day that involves you, after all.”
>The tigress cocks an eyebrow
>”And that would be...?”
>”Well, Anon and I had a chat with a certain vixen....”
>Sherry-K freezes up
>”...And after a nice lunch we got to talking about our favorite coordinator,” Rox says. “She seems pretty interested in you, Sher.”
>”W-what did she say!?”
>The tigress is right in Rox’s face
>”Woah, easy,” the wolfess says, leaning back. “We didn’t go too deeply into things. Just wanted to make sure she had some mutual feelings for you, and she does. So now we can move on to the next part.”
>Sherry-K nods furiously
>Rox leans back in and taps a claw on the tigress’ clipboard
>”I’d like to set something nice up for the two of you. Do you have a personal number I can reach you by?”
>Sherry-K whips out a pen and scribbles her digits down
>She might have needed that inspection form, or whatever it was she just wrote all over....
>Sherry-K rips the corner off and shoves the scrap paper at Rox
>”That’a girl,” Rox chuckles, pocketing the phone number carefully while the tigress’ wide eyes watch
>Rox pulls Sherry-K into her arm, patting her on the back
>It’s hard to tell whether Sherry-K’s budding smile is because of the possible date in the near future, or because of the wolfess touching her
>Either way, it’s bizarre to see the tigress’ face shaped like that
>Yet endearing at the same time
>”I’ll touch base with you as soon as I can,” Rox says. “We’re waiting on Chee to get back tomorrow; got someone I’d like her to meet as well. Can you hold it together for a few more days?”
>Sherry-K tries to compose herself at Rox’s banter
>She can really throw that professionalism back on effortlessly
>Though for how many times you’ve been up close to her, you can pick up on some subtle cues that give away the tigress’ excitement
>”I have no trouble waiting to hear back from you. Take all the time you...I-I mean, *ahem*, please keep me updated whenever possible.”
>”Will do, Sher!”
>The tigress struts off, only to spin around when she realizes she doesn’t know which way she’s going
>Rox gets some entertainment out of it at least
>”Poor girl,” she says with a click of her tongue as Sherry-K darts off
>You find yourself in your usual spot under Rox’s arm
>”Y’know, it’s really a relief that we’ve done our ‘thing’ together already. I was starting to get afraid both Chee AND Sher were going to get some before I did!”
>Rox gives you a quick kiss on the cheek
>”How embarrassing would THAT be? I match up all our friends and I end up being the least experienced one of the group.”
>Rox has some pretty unusual worries
>”Imagine if I had to start begging Chee for pointers. Sitting all timidly on the couch while she puffs on a cigarette with a leather jacket and...huh...did ya’ forget something, Sher?”
>It startles you when the tigress creeps back up on the two of you
>Any amount of reservedness she left with is out the window now
>”I almost forgot to mention,” Sherry-K says, “that I have an update of my own regarding Mr. D. Whimsey Jr.”
>Now it’s Rox’s turn to freeze up
>”Yeah? And what’s that?”
>”He would indeed like to meet the two of you at his office on the park grounds to discuss the mascot initiative, as well as allowing Anon to see the rest of our society outside of Whimsey World.”
>”No way! When!?”
>Rox and Sherry-K look like two gossiping high school girls
>”Early next week,” Sherry-k says earnestly. “He’ll be back from a trip in a few days, and then he’ll contact me with the details.”
>”That's...haha, that’s great!”
>Rox lunges forward to hug Sherry-K
>The tigress looked ready for it, opening her arms ever so slightly to welcome Rox’s gratitude

>Is it nostalgia, or déjà vu?
>As the workday progresses in its usual way you’re hit with a familiar feeling
>Rox energetically performs in the costume—not unusual ever since trying to turn a new leaf—but it’s not for the sake of the guests or even management
>It seems like she’s doing it for you
>In a way reminiscent of when you were first assigned to her as a handler
>At the time you assumed she was trying to get you to loosen up and help you get used to the Whimsey employee lifestyle
>Later on, you realized she was trying to become friends with you
>Now, this newly transformed wolfess is showing the whole world who her closest partner is
>Her mate for life
>Every time she hovers close to you, you think she’s going to burst out of the costume and maul you with love
>”Well, you know me,” she whispers to you when you get a moment alone, “I feel like I got a little more ‘spunk’ in me today.”
>That’s a little lewd
>Still, you laugh at her joke all the same
>Though if there’s any major concern you have, it’s that you’ve created a monster
>Opening up Pandora’s Box to all kinds of bedroom ravaging and pelvis crushing
>During lunch break, Rox and you have your own table as usual
>This time, it feels like she’s proud of having you all to herself
>Protecting you in her personal territory
>Ready to bark and snarl at anyone who dares to approach you
>But she holds you close and gives you the same arm punches you know all too well from her
>It’s the same Rox overall
>Just a Rox with a bit more self-assurance
>Everything certainly looks to be falling into place for the wolfess, and she’s wearing her satisfaction on her sleeves
>The moment of truth comes later in the evening after the two of you get off the clock
>You get some food and unwind at the apartment as typical after a shift
>She runs down to the laundry room with the wad of sheets, beaming when she returns
>It’s probably not safe to ask if she ran into another tenant
>You’re dragged to the living room while you wait between wash and dry cycles
>You expect clothes to fly off the second you settle down on the couch, but Rox never makes the move
>Just the two of you watch some television with her arm keeping you pulled up against her body
>That smile never leaves her face
>Her expression only changes when she opens her muzzle wide for a long yawn
>”Not a bad day, huh? Looking forward to getting our roomie back tomorrow. Having a little time to ourselves was nice, but I kinda miss her bubbly spirit.”
>Doesn’t Rox want to capitalize on what time you have left?
>You don’t necessarily want to provoke her, but you’re waiting for the hunter to come out and pounce at any instant
>When enough time passes for the sheets to be dry, Rox makes one final trip to the laundry room
>She returns with the bundle and disappears into the bedroom with a mischievous wink
>Now you’re just getting paranoid
>”Alright, time for bed!” she calls out
>Brace yourself, you think as you slink into the bedroom
>The wolfess strips down—starting with her shirt and letting her chest jiggle free
>Her pants come off next—her rump popping out and her tail swinging in a circle
>When you remove your own clothes, Rox is standing there with arms crossed under her breasts
>She shakes her head in amusement
>”You’ve had that funny look on your face all day, champ. Still got that fire in your loins, huh? I might have created a monster....”
>Hey, that’s your line
>The wolfess towers over you and pats you on the head
>Then she throws the sheets back and takes her usual spot
>”Hope I don’t break your heart, but I think you drained me pretty good last night. I know we have one more night to ourselves, but I think we should go back to pacing ourselves.”
>You lie down next to Rox, nestled in her large body right where you belong
>Part of you is proud of Rox’s restraint
>Part of you is admittedly a little disappointed
>”I always thought sex was the big ‘point of no return’, ya know? Once you get there, you can’t really go back to all the cuddles. Boy, in retrospect I was just as naïve as Chee.”
>Rox nuzzles you, shaping your body into her curves
>It’s even softer and more soothing than ever before
>A little erotic to have her heated womanhood so close to your skin, but you have to focus past her toasty coat of fur to really feel it
>”This is still nice too, right?”
>Her paw travels down your chest to your waist, but doesn’t stray farther
>She has to be teasing you
>Or...maybe not
>Rox had ripped her shirt off just to show she was comfortable with you
>She could just be someone who likes to sleep in the nude, and now she feels she can do that with you
>The wolfess breathes deeply into your back
>”I’m fine saving the heavy stuff for special nights if you are. Might be a little harder to sneak it in with Chee so close, but...heh...that could be half the fun.”
>Unpredictable as always
>You can feel her chuckle against you
>”Thanks for understanding. Alright, here it comes....”
>She slathers you with kisses and a few more nips to your neck
>”I looove you, Anon. G’night....”
>You might not have your underwear on, but at least you can go to sleep with your pelvis intact



[[ CHAPTER 21: Roxstar ]]

>*bzzt bzzt*
>Rox’s phone wakes you up before the alarm does
>The wolfess yawns, rolling on top of you
>”Mornin’, Anon,” she says, reaching for her phone
>Her body bears down on you heavily
>Her fur tickles your senses, including a few that have ‘roused’ earlier than you have
>”Mornin’, little Anon,” she chuckles
>Rox’s paw strays down to your groin
>You inhale sharply as her warm paw pads close around you
>”Maybe we can do something about this after we ‘get up’ ourselves.”
>Rox checks her phone and lets out a sigh
>”Crap, maybe not. Looks like Chee’s coming back early. She wants to see us before we head out to work.”
>She’s still hanging onto you
>Rolling her digits over your morning wood, thinking deeply
>”Hmm, best not to risk it I guess. C’mon, let’s get dressed before our roommate comes barging in.”
>Still not letting go
>Or moving off of you
>Rox rubs her body up against you with a few grunts
>”Dammit, should have taken advantage of last night while we had the chance. You could have been a little more assertive, Anon.”
>When you open your mouth to argue, her tongue darts inside and you’re locked into a kiss
>”It’s alright, I forgive you. Well, I will AFTER some ear scratches later.”
>Rox finally releases you so you can get dressed
>There’s no evidence of your weekend romp in the apartment, but she makes sure to double check just to be safe
>The two of you have a light breakfast while you wait for Chee to get back
>”Wanna make a bet on how much new stuff she’s coming back with?”
>Don’t think so
>You’ve learned pretty quickly not to take Rox up on her bets
>It’s getting close to the time you need to leave when the apartment door finally opens
>The oriole is noticeably quieter than you expected her to be
>”Hey Chee!” Rox says. “You have a good time?”
>”U-uh huh,” Chee mumbles
>”Your parents doing okay?”
>”Y-yeah....”
>The wolfess gives her a concerned look
>”What’s going on, Chee? You look like something’s eating you.”
>The bird’s emotions snowball from that moment
>She drops her bags to the floor, shaking
>Her face scrunches up and her eyes fill up with water
>She brings her wings to her face, and then everything lets loose
>Chee cries harder than you’ve ever heard from her
>Rox rushes over and holds the bird in her arms
>”Chee, what’s wrong?”
>Chee can’t even speak for a while
>When she can breathe at last, her words are broken by hiccups
>”M-m-my parents...they want me to come h-home! They want m-me to leave Whimsey World!”
>She bawls even harder
>”I d-don’t want to leave, Roxie! I don’t want to leave!”
>Your stomach knots up
>Rox is speechless
>Chee just keeps wailing
>You’re all at a loss for what to do
>”Why do they...?” Rox chokes out
>It’s clear her heart’s lodged in her throat
>”T-t-they think I’m just wasting my future h-here,” Chee sobs. “They want me t-to come back home and get a r-real job like my brothers and s-s-sisters....”
>Rox looks angry
>Angry at the thought of losing her dearest friend
>Angry at Chee’s parents for thinking Whimsey isn’t a “real job”
>The wolfess grabs Chee by the shoulders, trying to get the bird to look into her eyes
>”Listen to me, Chee. We’ll get through this, I promise. I won’t let them take you away from us, alright? Are your parents still in the area?”
>Chee nods
>Rox motions you over, and she transfers the hysteric bird into your arms
>For how light Chee is, she can be capable of some crushing strength
>Rox looks to you pleadingly
>”I’m going to need your support for this, Anon.”
>She laughs grimly
>”We might have to skip our lunch break today, though.”
>Whatever it takes to keep your roommate from leaving
>Rox pulls her phone out and leaves you to console Chee as best as you can
>You can just make out her words as she paces nervously back to the bedroom
>”Sher? It’s Rox.”

>It’s impossible to focus on work today
>Rox tried to get someone to cover her shift, but had no such luck
>She was seconds away from just blowing work off altogether, but Chee begged her not to
>With Rox’s spotty track record, pulling a stunt like that wouldn’t look good for her chances at the mascot initiative
>Or keeping her job altogether
>”Should have just kept my big mouth shut,” she growls when the two of you have a moment alone out in the park
>She’s beating herself up about it hard, even though she had nothing to do with this
>Rox sighs, loud enough for you to feel her pain
>”I just...when I said I wanted her to ‘fly the nest’ I didn’t mean like this. I jinxed it. I fucking jinxed it!”
>She punches a garbage can in frustration
>Even with her costume’s padded hands, it’s enough force to make a visible dent
>Better the garbage can than some poor guest, at least
>You try to calm Rox down a bit
>No matter what she said, she had nothing to do with Chee’s predicament
>”I can handle if she had to move out of the apartment, but I can’t stand losing her for good, Anon....”
>Even through the thick costume you can sense Rox’s sorrow
>”She’s the only one who ever put up with my shit...and always with a SMILE, too! I never had a lot of friends, but I didn’t think I needed any other than her. I’d be a mess without her. Hell, in some ways she’s even more of a mother than my own mom!”
>She glances up to one of the clock towers scattered around the park
>There’s nothing you can do until your lunch break, and time is more than prepared to remind you of that
>”Dammit, Chee....”

>Break time finally arrives
>Rox has you in hand, pulling you through the employee tunnels and farther out of the park
>She throws you into her car and the two of you speed off toward the Cast Complex
>It’s the only place you can meet Chee’s parents on park grounds, considering even anthro families aren’t supposed to be in the employee backstage areas unauthorized
>Rox got Chee to call her parents and have them meet up with you here
>They probably think they’re just going to say hello to Rox before they head home
>You find Chee and her parents over in the lobby where the Whimsey museum begins
>It’s completely empty except for the trio of orioles, you, and Rox
>Chee’s mother and father both have gorgeous plumage, just like their daughter
>They immediately give you shocked looks as you approach
>”Mom, Dad...this is, um, Anon,” Chee says
>This is more than a little awkward
>They just have their beaks open, unable to find the proper words
>Guess you’re still an enigma to these anthros
>”Excuse me for being late....”
>Now THERE’s a voice you never thought you’d be relieved to hear
>Sherry-K marches into the lobby, dressed in her usual coordinator’s pinstripes and armed with a clipboard
>Though something about her is a little off...
>Also, isn’t today supposed to be her day off?
>The tigress walks right up to Chee’s parents and extends a paw
>”Sherry-K, Head Coordinator. Pleasure to meet you both.”
>The two orioles shake Sherry-K’s paw, though they keep glancing back to you
>This doesn’t go unnoticed by the tigress’ grassy eyes
>”I expect neither of you have been properly introduced to Anon,” she says. “He has been under Chee’s care since entering our company.”
>”Wait, he...living with Chee?” the mother gasps
>The two parents look at their daughter with confusion
>She really didn’t break the news to them yet
>”I apologize if there has been any miscommunication,” Sherry-K says. “Chee has been asked to keep Anon’s situation confidential while we intergrade him into our organization.”
>”How long—?” Chee’s father blurts out
>But Sherry-K cuts him off
>She’s right on point
>”Almost two weeks now, and there have been zero incidents. I have personally selected Chee to watch over Anon as she has proven to be highly capable of such a responsibility, already having demonstrated admirable success in watching over Roksa.”
>You can’t tell if that was a slight against the wolfess or just a joke
>Rox doesn’t look happy about it either way
>But she holds her tongue as you hold her arm
>”Now then,” Sherry-K continues, “it is my understanding that Chee is thinking of leaving the Whimsey Corporation?”
>The way Sherry-K words the question makes it very obvious she knows it’s not Chee’s wish
>And she blames the parents for it, too
>Though nobody is going to challenge the tigress’s accusations and her unparalleled professionalism
>Chee’s parents look to one another for an answer
>The father steps up first
>”Well,” he says, “our daughter has been working here for a while now, and we’ve talked to her about finding another career. We were under the impression this was going to be a temporary sort of job.”
>Sherry-K nods thoughtfully
>”I understand. It is not my place to question or interfere with family matters. This company was founded on the bond Darwin Whimsey shared with his family, biological or otherwise. However....”
>That one word carries so much weight behind it, especially from the mouth of someone like Sherry-K
>”I would like to say on behalf of the Whimsey Corporation that we would be losing an exceptionally talented member of our family. Chee is far and above one of our better employees, and that’s not a compliment I give out frivolously.”
>Rox rolls her eyes
>It’s enough to make Chee’s parents look somewhat impressed, though
>”As a matter of fact,” Sherry-K adds, “I am currently in the process of approving a pending promotion for Chee. She will be elevated to Senior Supervisor of Park Operations within a few days.”
>Knowing Sherry-K—and Whimsey as a whole—this is probably just a fancy way to say “running the attractions with a little more seniority”
>Though the tigress could make custodial duties sound important by the way she hypes them up
>Regardless, the new title makes Chee suck in air loudly out of awe
>And that’s enough to sell it to her parents
>”Admittedly, not every position within the company is glamorous or well-compensating,” Sherry-K says, “and it’s unfortunate that many of our employees do not exhibit the aptitude to rise very far through the ranks. Your daughter, however, shows incredible potential. There is a lot of vertical advancement opportunity within Whimsey Corporation, and if Chee stays on this course she will no doubt see the upper echelons of the company in the near future.”
>For a brief moment you’re worried that Sherry-K might be laying it on a little too thick
>But you quickly realize that she’s completely right
>Chee is easily one of the hardest workers in the park, and her undying love of Whimsey makes her a perfect fit
>You’d never want to see her deal with the same kind of stress you saw Sherry-K crack under, but then again Chee could be a special case
>The bird girl looks to her parents with hope
>They look to each other with worry, but their daughter’s misty eyes seem to melt their hearts
>”If this is what you want...” the mother says
>Chee nods furiously
>”Alright then,” the father says. “We can talk more about this later. Would you mind driving your mother and me back to the station?”
>”I can arrange a driver,” Sherry-K interjects. “I would like to speak with Chee a little longer while she’s here. Might I recommend the Cast clearance store while you wait?”
>Man, that tigress is smooth
>Chee’s parents head out toward the clearance store while the rest of you hang back
>Sherry-K doesn’t have time to brace herself before the bird wraps her wings around her
>Chee’s back to sobbing, but out of happiness this time
>”T-t-thank you, Sherry! Thank you!”
>Rox stifles a laugh as Sherry-K tries to figure out how to handle the situation
>The tigress just pats the bird on the back gingerly
>”D-do you really mean it?” Chee sniffs. “About the p-promotion?”
>”I’m not in the habit of making promises I don’t intend on keeping. I meant every word of what I said, yes.”
>Of course Chee would start crying again
>”So you’re really able to just push a promotion through like that?” Rox speaks up at last. “Didn’t think you had the kind of power, Sher.”
>Sherry-K manages to calm Chee down enough to step away
>She straightens her shirt and stands with dignity
>”Yes, well, it seems I too have been given some degree of advancement within the company. Ever since Anon has come into our lives I’ve found myself burdened with an increasing amount of responsibility, but with the benefit of greater authority.”
>Sherry-K cocks an eyebrow at you
>It’s hard to read her thoughts of you, but they can’t be bad after everything you’ve gone through, right?
>Right?
>”Well, we really owe you one, Sher,” Rox says. “You helped keep our little family together, and we....”
>The wolfess’ eyes narrow
>”Are you, uh, wearing eye shadow, Sher?”
>The tigress’ eyes dilate
>You just KNEW something was different about her
>There’s a light dusting of violet color around Sherry-K’s eyes, which she hastily wipes away
>There’s already some smeared makeup on the back of her furry paw as well
>She tugs at her collar and flips through papers on her clipboard absentmindedly
>”N-no, there’s an explanation...indeed, what had happened...with that said...just as I noted....”
>She makes a cough that sounds like a gunshot
>Then she’s back to her reserved way
>”I need get a hold of that driver for Chee’s parents. Rox, Anon...I trust you will make it back in time for the rest of your shift?”
>Right on cue, your stomach yells at you
>Looks like you’re definitely going to be missing lunch today
>”Don’t worry, I’ll treat us to something nice later,” Rox whispers
>Before she leaves, Sherry-K gives Rox a stern look
>”On the matter of ‘owing’ me,” she says, “I hope you will look into the affair we discussed yesterday.”
>The tigress gives Chee a quick glance for emphasis
>”Yeah, I’ll get right on that,” Rox says with an A-Okay signal. “Thanks again for showing up on your day off, Sher.”
>”Very good.”
>Sherry-K walks out of the lobby, brushing her eyes again as discreetly as she can
>Chee folds both you and Rox up in her wings
>”Oh, thank you both for being here! I couldn’t ask for better friends! I’m going to have a wonderful dinner cooked for you both by the time you get home from work!”
>”Aw, don’t sweat it, Chee. We can bring something back ourselves. You should take it easy after all you’ve gone through today.”
>”No no! I insist! I’ll make something nice for the three of us, and I’ll tell you all about my weekend!”
>You can see Rox’s hand hovering in preparation for a facepalm
>But she restrains herself
>”You know what? That sounds nice. I’d love to hear it, Chee.”
>The wolfess gives both of you a warm smile
>Never again is she going to take her friends for granted
>”Great! Maybe then you can tell me about the weekend YOU guys had!”
>Rox scratches her neck sheepishly
>”Haha, ehh...I don’t think so....”



[[ CHAPTER 22: Roksa Casbah ]]

>”...And then we played Whimsey Trivia for an hour while we had Frostbitten playing in the background and my mom was sewing up my Princess Glacika scarf, and I told them about the fun time we had last weekend at the Cast Complex, and....”
>Chee gives you and Rox the complete play-by-play of her weekend with her parents
>A small price to pay for a nice, home cooked meal
>Rox isn’t exactly listening with rapt attention, but she isn’t ripping her ears out like you’d expect from having to endure her roommate’s unrelenting storytelling
>In fact, she looks pretty happy about things
>It only took the threat of losing one of her closest friends to make the wolfess grateful for what she has
>”Hey!” Chee says. “Maybe we could watch Frostbitten together tonight?”
>You try to anticipate what sort of response Rox is going to make
>Like, “I don’t really feel like it tonight”, or “Haven’t you seen it enough already?”
>But Rox has none of that snark for the bird
>”Yeah...sure, Chee. Whatever you wanna do.”
>It’s the closest the three of you have ever been in the apartment, literally and figuratively
>Unusual for sure, but very much heartwarming
>When dinner’s over the three of you all sit together on the couch, watching Chee’s favorite Whimsey movie
>Rox has one arm around the bird’s shoulder and the other around yours
>Her eyes look past the TV, but there’s a permanent smile on her muzzle
>She absentmindedly rocks her head to the sound of Chee singing along to the songs
>The wolfess is in a trance, lost in her thoughts and daydreams
>You know you’re a part of them as she strokes your shoulder
>”I really do hope we can have Sherry-K over for a movie night someday,” Chee says during a slow moment in the film
>Rox snaps back to reality
>The tigress’ name being the key
>”I’ve been meaning to talk to you about something after you got back,” she says. “I’ve been planning a way to treat Sher to a nice evening and introduce her to your friend Mio, and I was hoping you’d help with this.”
>Chee blinks
>”Sure, Roxie. What do you need me to do?”
>”Well, our Cast Night’s coming up pretty soon, and since you’re going to be on OUR rotation now it’s the perfect chance to get all of us and Mio together. I have a little surprise in mind for her and Sher: a nice dinner in that Whimsey Castle restaurant. I want you to talk Mio into dressing up and coming along.”
>Chee gasps loudly
>”Oh, how magical! They’ll love it!”
>”You’ll be along for it, too. And Anon will. I want this to feel as natural as it can for the girls, just like a casual dinner between coworkers, right?”
>Chee gasps even louder
>”ME? In the castle for dinner!?”
>She looks like it’s her who’s getting the surprise
>Chee has no doubt been in the Castle before, but probably not in the restaurant from a guest’s perspective
>”Yeah, why not? You’re always taking care of us, and I’m sure Mio will appreciate you being there to ease things up a bit.”
>You didn’t think there was ever a way to get Chee to ignore a Whimsey movie, but not even the emotional climax to Frostbitten is enough to recapture her attention now
>”I’ll talk to Mionra the first thing tomorrow!” the oriole sings. “Thank you, Roxie!”
>”Hey, we’re the ones who should be thanking you,” Rox says. “Well, ME more than Anon. You’ve done more for me than I could probably ever repay you for, Chee.”
>Rox draws Chee in for a hug
>”I’m pretty lucky I got stuck with a roommate like you.”
>The wolfess pulls you closer as well to join in the fuzzy feelings
>The movie credits finish scrolling by before anyone says anything else
>”So, it’s going to be the five of us at the dinner?” Chee says, looking ahead with excitement
>”Actually, there’s one more I’m planning on bringing along,” Rox says
>A grin stretches on her face
>”I owe him a bit for something. So, I figured I’d repay him and fill in that last seat to even out those nice little tables the restaurant has at the same time.”
>”That’s really nice of you, Roxie! Who is it?”
>”You know that pheasant who works in the Castle?”
>”Amadeus? Yeah! He seems like a really nice guy.”
>Rox chuckles slyly
>”I’m glad you think so.”

>The apartment feels at harmony
>Chee’s back
>She’s here for good
>And everyone is happy with themselves
>”Goodnight!” Chee calls out to you and Rox when it’s time for bed
>You have to admit, you missed that
>Now you have to see how things go with your wolfess
>The two of you stand in Rox’s bedroom, just staring at each other for a while
>”So, how much do you think we can get away with tonight?” Rox says mirthfully
>Oh boy...
>”I’m kidding!” she says, holding up her paws
>Then she scratches her chin, eyeing you from head to toe
>”I mean...sort of. Yeah, I think we’ll have to restrain ourselves now that mother hen is back. It’s definitely going to make things a little challenging for us...even just how we sleep together.”
>Didn’t seem to be a problem before
>Even when she slept without her shirt
>”I can cover the puppies up fast enough,” she says, cupping her chest for emphasis. “But I’m not sure how fast I can throw some shorts on if she comes barging into the room and my tail’s up in the air.”
>Maybe she could actually try setting some boundaries with her roommate for once?
>”I guess so....”
>You look at Rox with suspicion
>Seems like an unusual hang-up for her to have all of the sudden
>”I didn’t want to lose Chee today, any part of her. That even includes her sweet innocence, too.”
>Her innocence?
>This coming from the wolfess who was bragging about corrupting the naïve bird
>”I’m just kind of afraid she really, honestly doesn’t know ANYTHING about...what couples do when they’re alone. You heard her stories tonight: she was genuinely confused why her parents wanted to put her in a separate room when they stayed at the suites.”
>Rox makes some lewd gestures with her paws
>”She obviously didn’t get the lesson about the birds and the Chees from her folks, and I don’t really want to be the one to teach her when she asks why we’re locking our door...or she accidentally sees our bare asses.”
>You just roll your eyes
>”Hey! Cut that out. These are valid concerns.”
>Rox sighs
>”Maybe I’ll have a talk with her tomorrow. For now, I guess there’s not much we can do but keep the pants on. Just the pants, though.”
>She whips her shirt off and climbs into bed with you following after
>But rather than spooning, she keeps your body facing hers
>Her golden eyes are full of hopefulness
>”Please?” she mouths
>The wolfess sticks the top of her head in your face
>”Remember, you owe me for getting me all riled up this morning.”
>She DID say this is how she’d “forgive” you
>You’re still trying to figure out how that’s fair, or even your fault
>You reach for her ears and give the backs some scratches
>One of her eyelids droops as you work your fingers into her fur
>*scritch scritch scritch*
>”Ooohhh yeahhh,” she moans
>After a while, Rox wads up some of the sheets and bites down on them
>Then she takes your hands and places them on her belly
>She’s playing a dangerous game, this girl...
Your hands rub up and down her stomach
>Feeling her abdominals tense up then relax
>Massaging from navel up just below the breast
>Rox’s noises intensify, and you can see the sheet clump in her mouth soaking through with her drool
>Her tail thumps the bed loudly
>”Mmmm...I luff hyoo,” she mumbles into her makeshift mouth gag.
>The petting continues for some time
>Your arms fall asleep before you do

>Rox has the look of a wild predator on her face today as the two of you walk through the employee tunnels
>She doesn’t seem to be angry, but her brow is furrowed and her eyes dart around everywhere
>And then she spots her prey
>Coming out of the guys’ locker room is Amadeus
>Rox slides in front of him, looming over the poor bird
>”Morning, Ace,” the wolfess smiles
>”A-ah!” Ace yelps. “G-good morning, uh, Rox.”
>The guy definitely doesn’t seem like he’s good at talking with the ladies
>Or at least the ones who could probably toss him over Whimsey Castle
>”Say, Ace...do you have any way of getting off work for this week’s Cast Night?”
>”This...what, you mean in two days?”
>”That’s the one.”
>The pheasant looks to you for support, hoping you’ll call off the lupine breathing down his neck
>”That’s...uh, a little short notice. Why...?”
>You urge Rox to get to the point
>The more she draws this out, the bigger the chance Ace is going to pass out from stress
>”Look,” the wolfess says, “how would you like to have dinner with Chee?”
>Maybe she should have eased into it after all...
>Ace’s eyes bug out and his beak practically unhinges
>”WHAT?”
>”Inside voices, Ace,” Rox hisses. “Alright, the quick version is that we’re planning on throwing a little dinner party for Sher, and Chee’s going to be there helping out. If you want to join us, here’s your formal invitation.”
>Ace balks at the mention of the tigress
>”W-wait, Sherry-K’s going to be there? I...uh...I don’t know....”
>That might actually be a bit of a problem
>Sherry-K’s preference for the ladies isn’t likely well known outside of a few people
>Would the tigress even want someone like Ace to figure it out?
>Either Rox hasn’t thought of this, or she just doesn’t care
>Knowing her, it’s probably the latter
>”Look, you’ll be fine,” Rox says. “Sher is going to be too preoccupied with what we have in store for her to care that you’re there. As long as you don’t pester her or anything, there’s nothing you have to worry about. You just need to keep your cool and focus on making small talk with Chee.”
>Ace squirms around a bit
>”I don’t know if I can switch my shifts in time,” he groans
>”Is there anyone I can talk to for you?” Rox says
>”W-well, there’s Baggy....”
>Ace looks like he just damned his friend to some horrible punishment
>”Great, I’ll have a chat with him,” Rox chuckles. “I think he owes us for being a poor partner for Anon when I was gone.”
>Rox has an interesting way of looking at debts and favors...
>You leave the pheasant looking baffled as Rox struts off triumphantly
>”You might want to talk to costuming if you need some nice clothes!” she calls back

>Rox is back to her usual self when your shift starts, but she seems a little on edge when it gets closer to lunch
>”Go on without me,” she says when your break arrives. “I need to do a little more ‘preparation’ while I have the chance. I don’t want you to have to miss lunch again.”
>You don’t like the thought of eating without Rox, but she’s far too fast to keep up with
>So it’s either you have lunch without her, or you go without food AND you waste all your energy tailing her
>Every so often you hear her name being muttered by other anthros, or see her dart by out of the corner of your eye
>She’s making waves, whatever she’s up to
>”Hey! Anon!”
>Chee flags you down when you reach the cafeteria
>”Roxie’s not sick, is she?” Chee whispers. “She doesn’t normally miss lunch.”
>You explain to Chee what’s going on, and she suddenly looks frightened
>Almost like Ace did
>”Uh-oh, I’m supposed to talk to Mionra. Roxie told me—whatever I do today—I have to get her to agree to come to Cast Night with us!”
>The bird looks around the cafeteria frantically
>You can see the vixen dumping her tray and getting ready to leave
>”Eep! M-MIONRA!”
>Chee flaps her wings and chases down her friend
>This was meant to be for a nice meal, Rox
>Nobody’s going to have a good time if everyone’s freaking out about it
>You eat your lunch in solitude
>It reminds you of the days you had to go without Rox by your side
>Everyone’s staring at you again, this time trying to figure out what’s gotten into the wolfess and why she’s not with you
>It’s fine, you didn’t have a huge appetite anyway...
>Although it gives you an excuse to save a snack for Rox when she inevitably comes back without having had anything herself
>Your break is almost over when the wolfess finally returns
>She looks satisfied about something
>”Hey,” Rox pants. “Welp, I got her!”
>What?
>Oh, she must mean Sherry-K
>”Kind of wish you were there to see it,” Rox laughs, slapping her knee. “The poor girl almost collapsed when I brought up the dinner. Took a bit of convincing to make her put down the clipboards for the night, but I guess someone’s covering for her on Cast Night.”
>Sherry-K?
>Not walking around with her stack of clipboards?
>No way
>”I knew you wouldn’t believe me. Doesn’t matter, because you’ll see the pretty kitty for yourself very soon!”
>Rox pulls out a nearby chair and slumps into it
>You hold out a back of chips for her
>”For me? Thanks, buddy.”
>She’s about to open the bag when she sees a mass of black and white lumbering out of the cafeteria
>The bag of chips explodes as Rox jerks it open in surprise
>”Cookie! WAIT!”
>She leaves the snack debris all over the floor as she charges after the panda
>You’re already beginning to look forward to Cast Night being over



[[ CHAPTER 23: Rox Me Amadeus ]]

>Cast Night
>Rox spent most of her free time yesterday organizing whatever she has planned for tonight
>She disappeared again today for lunch to make sure everything’s all prepared
>Her dedication to this is impressive
>”Our friends need this,” she pants when you finally manage to catch her for a minute. “Life can’t just be all about work. It’s killing Sher, and I don’t want Chee to miss what it’s like to have someone really special in her life. Her own Anon, you know?”
>Rox begins to dash off again, but she turns around as though forgetting something
>She plants a big kiss on your cheek
>”And WE could use this, too. Haven’t had a formal dinner date yet and we don’t really get many chances to do this in the actual park.”
>Not to mention how much it would cost even if you were allowed to treat Rox like you were both guests
>It’s a shame you couldn’t get the whole place to yourselves, though
>”Yeah, a triple date isn’t as romantic, but I’m sure it’ll be fun anyway.”
>Rox snickers and shakes her head
>”Then again, we’re dealing with four helpless, inexperienced daters. We might have our work cut out for us tonight.”
>The wolfess runs off for the remainder of your lunch break, almost late in returning to the park grounds
>You can hear giddy laughter coming from her costume as the two of you finish up your shift
>It certainly helps the goofiness of her performances
>Though you don’t know whether to be excited with her or a little concerned
>Rox doesn’t wait past a minute of the hour before splitting off once again
>”Go make sure Ace is all cleaned up,” she says before leaving. “I’m gonna find our little feline friend.”
>It doesn’t take you long to find the pheasant
>He’s in the locker room, struggling to get himself dressed in a pretty sharp looking vest
>Seems like bird anthros aren’t made for wearing traditional suits, what with their wings and all
>”Oh, hey Anon,” Ace grunts, hopping around in circles like a dog chasing his tail
>You help him get everything clasped and buttoned
>”Thanks. I’m not really used to being dressed up like this. I, uh, borrowed this from costuming like Rox said.”
>Whimsey does a pretty nice job with their costumes
>You wouldn’t be able to tell it’s from a theme park unless you work here
>Though that might be a problem for poor Ace, considering two of the girls are massive Whimsey fans
>”Hey, could you tell me a little bit about Chee?” Ace says while you get dressed yourself. “Like her favorite movies and things? I don’t want to bore her….”
>Chee doesn’t seem like the type to think people are boring
>But you tell the pheasant everything you know about her
>”Frostbitten, huh?” Ace says with a grimace when you mention Chee’s favorite princess. “That’s rough. Not a big fan of it, but…well, if that’s what she’s into. Thanks.”
>At least he’s a good sport and willing to make it work
>You hear muffled arguing coming from the women’s locker room
>You and Ace hang around outside, where Rox told you to wait for her
>”Alright, fine! You’re a big girl; I’ll let you do it yourself!” the wolfess shouts behind her as she exits the locker room
>She’s in her high-skirted, golden dress from the night with the fireworks
>Toned thighs visible, shoulders bare, chest hefted up and prominently displayed
>This time she’s let more of her wolfish side stay out, with her head and neck fur tousled wildly
>Though that might just be from a lack of time or space to get properly cleaned up
>And yet she looks even more beautiful this way
>”Evening, boys,” Rox says with a wink. “Just waiting on our woman of the hour to figure out how dresses work.”
>”A-and Chee?” Ace says
>His nerves are already getting the better of him
>Rox grins deviously
>”Someone’s got a hot date I take it?”
>Ace tugs at his collar nervously
>”Ah, just messing with you,” Rox laughs. “Chee’s driving Mio here, so we’ll meet up with them at the restaurant.”
>You hear the slow pace of heavy footsteps approaching from inside the locker room
>Everyone backs up to give the tigress room for her appearance
>Sherry-K steps out, looking a little uncomfortable
>But also very, very elegant
>She’s wearing a vibrant teal dress that perfectly compliments her fierce orange pelt
>It’s not as short and risqué as Rox’s, but it does just as good of a job at accentuating the feline’s modest curves
>You never realized just how busty Sherry-K actually was under those unflattering pinstripe shirts
>Her fur is immaculately groomed, and you see that subtle dusting of violet makeup around her grassy eyes
>The only thing that takes away from the bombshell picture in front of you is how stiffly she carries herself
>Her arms are very clearly grasping at invisible clipboards
>”Looking hot, Sher!” Rox says, walking around the tigress
>Sherry-K’s eyes wander down Rox’s cleavage
>”You’re not doing that body any favors by covering it up with those ugly uniforms,” the wolfess continues
>”Roksa, please!” Sherry-K hisses
>The tigress glares at you and Ace, daring you to say anything
>”Alright, keep those cat tats in,” Rox scoffs. “Let’s go get the rest of our little dinner party.”
>”You’re not expecting us to walk around on the grounds like this, are you?” Sherry-K says
>”Why? Are you afraid of showing a little fur to your coworkers?”
>The tigress stares daggers at the wolfess
>”Yeesh,” Rox says. “We’re going to have to get you some wine or something, STAT.”

>The employee tunnels are barren as you make your way to the castle backstage
>Everyone either went home or is out enjoying the attractions
>The only other coworker you see along the way is Cookie, who is working the restaurant kitchen
>”Thanks again for doing this, Cook,” Rox says
>The panda grunts in affirmation
>This was his Cast Night as well, so Rox really must have buttered him up to go along with this
>When you pass through the kitchen you end up out in the main restaurant floor
>It’s enormous like a ballroom, with a plentiful number of tables scattered around
>Many are pushed to the side, leaving a single table alone in a wide clearing
>Standing beside the table are Chee and Mionra
>Chee looks as bubbly as ever in a tiny, rosy princess dress that’s far cuter and innocent than anything any of the other anthro ladies are wearing
>By contrast, Mionra looks like a gift all wrapped up with her stunning emerald cocktail dress and a large, exquisite bow tied around her neck
>Vixens have a naturally easy time being charming
>Rox glances smugly at Sherry-K, who looks to be having difficulty swallowing the lump in her throat
>The same can be said about Ace, who retreated behind you as soon as he saw Chee
>”Well!” Rox says with a loud clap of her paws. “Everyone’s here, so let’s sit down and get to know each other!”
>She has to nudge Sherry-K forward with every step, while Ace needs to be practically dragged forward
>Once at the table, everyone looks at their dates
>Sherry-K clears her throat
>”Mionra,” she says as professionally as possible. “You’re looking…rather lovely tonight.”
>The vixen takes her all in
>”Sherry, wow,” Mionra says with a twitch of her bushy tail, “Why haven’t we ever seen this side of you before?”
>This catches the tigress off guard
>”Excuse me?”
>”You carry yourself with such incredible authority, but those awful coordinator shirts don’t do you justice. I feel like this is the first time we’re really seeing the true Sherry-K.”
>”I see…” the tigress says, straightening out her dress
>Meanwhile, Ace seems to be struggling with his composure just as much
>”H-hey, Chee. You look g-great tonight!” the pheasant stutters
>”Thank you!” the oriole says. “You too, Amadeus!”
>”Heh, a-actually it’s A…uh, yeah, thanks.”
>It’s feeling less like a dinner date and more like a prom
>Rox turns to you and grabs your hand tightly
>”I’m Rox. Nice to meet ya!”
>She yanks you into a smothering hug
>Your face is buried in her fur and you inhale her pleasing, earthly scent
>For being just as much of a city girl as any human female—dress and all—her smell makes you imagine the forested wilderness
>Rox’s muzzle is right up against your ear
>”I tend to put out after a really good date,” she whispers. “Just food for thought.”
>She slaps you on the back and pulls a chair out for you
>”Everyone grab your buddy and take a seat! Our waiter will be right over.”
>You all sit down with your respective dates, with an appropriate wingman on the other side
>You’re keeping an eye on Ace, Chee has Mionra nearby, and Rox is Sherry-K’s moral support
>Cookie marches out from the kitchen with menus and water
>Even the largest waiter uniform Whimsey World has isn’t quite enough to fit a panda bear
>His outfit is comically stretched over his burly body
>Nobody has said anything since sitting down, so it’s up to Rox to break the ice as Cookie pours the waters
>”Sooo…where does everyone know each other from?” the wolfess says with wiggling eyebrows
>You can almost hear the crickets
>Well, you thought it was a little funny
>”Great, thanks,” Rox mutters sarcastically
>Everyone sits in silence reading their menu
>Is Cookie really going to make anything you ask for?
>Rox leans forward slightly, and then Sherry-K gasps
>”R-Roksa!” she snarls
>”Sorry, sorry!” Rox says. “Thought I was scratching my own leg there!”
>Sherry-K scoots away from the wolfess with an upturned nose
>Now putting her closer to Mionra
>Somehow you think this was Rox’s plan all along
>Mionra smiles sweetly to Sherry-K, who tries to contort her face likewise
>On the other side of the table, Ace is working up the courage to talk to Chee
>”So, I hear you’re, uh, really big into Whimsey?”
>”Yes!” Chee squeals. “I love it all so much! The park, the cartoons, the movies....”
>”Y-yeah, me too!” Ace says. “I bet you’re really into...Frostbitten?”
>Oh that poor bastard
>Now he’s done it
>Chee’s eyes go wide, and she jitters in her seat
>”It’s my FAVORITE! Oh, Princess Glacika is the best princess and it has such a great message about family and Puddles is the cutest sidekick and I listen to the soundtrack every day and I heartheymightbeworkingonasequel!”
>Maybe you should have warned Ace not to lead with Frostbitten discussion...
>Ace catches a break for a moment when Cookie returns to take everyone’s orders
>He definitely seems to be honoring everyone’s choices
>”Roksa, how is this all getting paid for?” Sherry-K asks inquisitively
>”Don’t worry, I got it all figured out,” Rox says with a wave of her paw. “Just get what looks good to you.”
>When it comes time for the wolfess to order, she just gets a hamburger
>Even Cookie raises an eyebrow
>”Are you serious, Rox?” Mionra says. “Everything here is so much better than the typical park fare. Why not be more adventurous?”
>”Geez, I didn’t know I was going to get grilled for just wanting a burger...haha....”
>”Are you going to push aside your vegetables as well?” Sherry-K adds in mockingly
>”No, mom, I’ll eat my damn vegetables.”
>Rox leans in closely to you
>”Can you help me with those, buddy?” she whispers
>Guess a diet of ramen sort of narrows one’s taste
>Miraculously, it seems jointly heckling Rox gets Sherry-K and Mionra to open up to each other a little more
>When all the orders are taken, Chee returns to talking Ace’s ears off
>Rox looks a little sour about getting ganged up on, but when she sees your face she warms up instantly
>Her paw strays to your lap under the table
>”Think it’s working?” she mouths to you, motioning to the rest of the table

>For normally being the most outgoing one, Rox keeps quiet for a lot of the meal
>She just observes the scene before you
>The tigress and vixen face each other a little more when they speak in turn
>The wine probably helped a lot
>There seems to be some genuine, mutual interest in their conversations, though it’s hard to miss the not-so-discreet glances they each make to each other’s bodies
>Rox only butts in when it sounds like the topics delve a little too deeply into work
>A compliment from Sherry-K about Mionra’s improvement in performance starts to drift toward park operations, until Rox kicks things back around
>”Yeah, Mio and I had quite the rebellious streak for a while. You’d almost think we were doing it just to hang out with you, Sher.”
>The tigress rolls her eyes, but Rox nods to Mionra encouragingly
>Hoping to coax a confession, perhaps
>”Actually, Rox is correct,” Mionra says carefully. “I gladly took the reprimands so I could have the private moments with you, Sherry.”
>You don’t know whether it’s a fox thing or a Mionra thing, but the vixen’s eyes have a downright enchanting effect to them
>Sherry-K reels back with shock
>”W-what? You don’t really mean that. Why didn’t you just...approach me on your own?”
>Mionra twirls a finger around the knots of her bow sheepishly
>”...It’s because I’m seen as not approachable, isn’t’ it?” Sherry-K sighs
>”I didn’t think you were at first, truthfully,” Mionra says, “but now that I’ve had the chance to talk to you, I see that it was my own hesitation holding me back. I should have worked up the courage sooner. It should have been ME taking the initiative, and not Rox pushing us together.”
>”You’re welcome,” Rox grunts
>The conversation between her and Sherry-K tapers off to silence for a little while
>Time to check in on the other lovebirds
>”...And the fifth time I visited the Whimsey Suites it was with all my brothers and sisters again and Sooty-nail came out that weekend so we stayed up extra late for the premiere and almost missed ‘Breakfast with the Characters’ the next morning and...”
>Well, Ace is still boned
>Though he nods the whole time with a polite grin on his face
>What a trooper
>Dishes are removed promptly by the panda waiter, as are the accumulating number of drink glasses
>It’s starting to get pretty late, and Cast Night will be over soon
>Table talk continues amongst the dates while Rox excuses herself
>”Gonna square things away with our chef,” she says, though you’re the only one really listening to her
>She confronts Cookie out of earshot and pulls out her wallet
>Money exchanges hands, and the two shake paws
>But as Cookie heads back to the kitchen to finish cleaning up, Rox looks down to her wallet
>Mournfully, with ears partially folded back
>It’s empty, no doubt
>She reads your face as you read hers when she returns to the table
>It was a generous thing she did, though you feel bad for how much it must have drained her savings
>”Hey, it was worth it,” she murmurs
>Rox points to Sherry-K and Mionra
>The tigress is in the middle of a story, speaking with frequent hand gestures (or paw gestures, rather)
>Each time she puts her paw down on the table, it gets a little closer to Mionra’s
>Soon their fur is touching
>Sherry-K might not have found quite a firebrand like Rox is, but she doesn’t seem to be complaining about the beautiful vixen seated right up against her with allure in her eyes and a gently swishing tail
>Rox drapes an arm around your shoulder and leans her head on yours, admiring her handiwork

>Cast Night is all but over
>Everyone grabs their belongings and waits for some sort of closure
>Sherry-K decides to make the first move
>”I have to admit, Roksa,” she says, “that was delightful evening.”
>”Agreed,” Mionra says
>”Yeah, thanks Roxie!” Chee chirps
>The bird turns to Ace, who’s lingering nearby
>”And I had a great time talking to you, Amadeus! Hey, if you’re on our schedule for Cast Nights now, you should totally come and hang out with us!”
>Chee wraps her wings around Ace and hugs him tightly
>The pheasants eyes bug out, and his cheeks puff out with happiness
>”Well, I’m ready to give you a ride home whenever you’re ready, Mionra!” Chee says
>”Actually, Chee,” Mionra says, “Sherry has offered to drive me home. Thank you for bringing me, though. I’m glad you talked me into this.”
>The vixen’s paw gravitates close to the tigress’
>The two of them are almost hip to hip
>”Alright, sounds good!” Chee responds. “Have a goodnight everyone! Roxie, Anon, I’ll see you two at home!”
>Chee skips off to the employee tunnels, followed by Sherry-K and Mionra at a slower pace
>The vixen gives a wave back at you in gratitude
>Now it’s just you and Rox...and Ace
>”Hey, man,” Rox says, patting the bird on the back. “Sorry you didn’t get much action tonight.”
>But Ace doesn’t look broken up about it in the slightest
>He’s still dazed by the hug
>”H-huh? Oh, yeah, no problem. I had fun tonight. T-thank you, both of you!”
>He strides off as well, with his wings wrapped around himself as though trying to relive the moment he had with Chee
>Now it’s truly just you and Rox
>”What a night, huh? Speaking of ‘action’....”
>Still under her arm, Rox leads you out of the restaurant with the lights shutting off behind you
>Her hips sway and her tail brushes against you with every wag
>”Someone’s earned a little something himself, I think. I DID have a great date, after all....”
>Rox adjusts her top, but she pulls the hem out deliberately to give you a little peek inside her dress
>The wolfess then rubs her muzzle all over your face and runs her paw up and down your neck
>It’s a long walk through the tunnels and back to her car, but you relish every step
>”Another weekend ahead of us,” Rox sighs
>It’s already the third one you’ve shared with the wolfess
>Somehow it already feels like months, or even an entire year
>”So what about you? You have anything in mind for what to do?”
>Obviously you know who you want to hang around with
>Rox chuckles
>”Alright, I’ll think of something fun. Maybe I’ll see if I can’t set up another playdate for our roommate. Get her out of the apartment for a little while, huh? Of course, it could also be nice to just laze around the place. We’ll think of something...or not.”
>Rox bops your nose with her own
>After the crazy week you’ve had, a little rest and relaxation would be welcome
>Held in the wolfess’ arms, against her warm fur and having her love for you repeated again and again...
>You were looking forward to Cast Night being over before, and now you are even more so
>A night of bringing people together needs to end with you being as close to your own lover as possible



[[ CHAPTER 24: Punk Rox ]]
 
>Rox stops you just outside of the apartment
>She drops her head and bats her eyelashes at you
>”I had a really good time tonight, Anon,” the wolfess says sweetly. “Not too bad for our first triple date, huh?”
>She gives you a quick kiss on the forehead
>You can tell she’s playing up the “demure sweetheart” shtick as a joke, but her displays of affection are always authentic
>It’s actually pretty adorable to see a big, spunky goofball like Rox act all shy and feminine, even if it’s just for a few moments
>She doesn’t keep the act going for long though before she licks her lips and gives you a seductive stare
>”Why don’t you come inside for a while?”
>This has been your home too for a few weeks now, but Rox somehow makes you feel like she’s inviting you someplace special for the very first time
>She opens the door for you invitingly, but someone’s already waiting on the other side
>”Welcome home, you two!”
>”Hey Chee....”
>The bird is in the middle of gleefully tidying up the apartment
>Not much different than any other night, though Rox is hoping to see a deeper meaning in her roommate’s cheery attitude
>”So...did ya have a good time?”
>”Mm hmm!” That was really fun! Thanks again for bringing me along, Roxie!”
>”Anytime, Chee. What did you think of Ace?”
>The bird blinks quizzically
>”Amadeus? O-oh, hehe…I always thought ‘Ace’ was someone completely different....”
>That’s not a reassuring sign
>”But anyway, he seemed really nice! He was a great listener, and we talked about all of my favorite things the whole time!”
>Poor guy probably didn’t get a single word in edgewise, let alone have a chance to chat about anything not Whimsey related
>”Anything else?” Rox says, trying to get more out of the bird
>”Um, I don’t think so...? Sherry-K and Mionra looked pretty happy!”
>”Wouldn’t you like to see Ace again sometime?”
>”Yeah, totally! Maybe we can see him at the next Cast Night we have off together!”
>The bird and wolfess hit a stalemate
>Rox keeps pushing Chee to expand on her statements a little more, and maybe even confess some earnest feelings for the pheasant
>But Chee just looks confused by the interaction she’s having with Rox
>”Is something wrong, Roxie?”
>Rox sighs
>”Nah, just making sure you had a good time, I guess. Yeah, we’ll have to get Ace to hang out with us again soon.”
>”Sounds good! Well, I’m getting a little tired. Hope you two have a nice day off. We’ll have to do something together on my next day off! Goodnight!”
>And Chee disappears into her room
>Rox stands there silently for a while
>You get the suspicion her ears are trying to pick up faint sounds from the bird’s room
>Like a late night phone call, or maybe something more personal...
>She looks a little ashamed when she catches you staring
>”I-I was just...ah, never mind. We’ll get those two lovebirds to open up to each other, trust me.”
>The wolfess grabs your shoulders and steers you away from Chee’s door, as though YOU were the one eavesdropping and getting caught
>She pushes you all the way to the bedroom, where the “first date flirting” resumes
>”Well, you were quite the gentleman tonight,” Rox says
>Her paws caress your face and she rubs her muzzle all around your head
>”Good company, courteous...maybe a little quiet. Can’t fault you for that, considering what a little chatterbox my friend was.”
>She continues rubbing over you, with her lips parted and the edges of her tongue lightly gliding over your skin
>Small tastes and soft sniffs
>”Hmph. Not a fan of how much you cleaned up, though. You could hardly pick up my scent on you, and there were so many lovely ladies out there tonight searching for someone to take home with them....”
>Rox’s silky coat brushes over your face next, and you get another whiff of that earthly smell of hers
>It’s downright mesmerizing
>Soon you’re breathing her in on your own will, taking in as much as you can with every inhale
>The wolfess’ chest rumbles with a deep chuckle
>”I keep forgetting you don’t have the same nose that I do. Guess I’m gonna have to do all I can to make sure you can pick up my scent…and never lose it.”
>Rox guides your head all over her fur, trying to make you understand the nuances and distinctions of every stretch of her pelt
>Before you know it, she has your face nestled into her chest and strokes the back of your neck fondly
>”Glad I kept my cool tonight having to wear this stupid thing again,” she says, pulling her dress down a little more for easier access. “Was beginning to think I cursed it when I had my little breakdown up in the castle. Man, I hate prissy clothes like this….”
>You’re happy she gave it another shot, though
>As much as you don’t really see Rox as a “dress girl”, she can still pull it off pretty well
>She laughs when you tell her this
>”Yeah, well I can ‘pull it off’ anytime you want me to.”
>The wolfess shimmies her body and the dress peels down further
>Soon it’s in a heap at her feet, leaving her in just her underwear and you descending along her torso
>Even her stomach seems to have its own aroma as your nose explores her navel and the lower regions of her body
>But Rox pulls you back upright before you stray too far down
>”That’s good for now. Don’t want you straining your neck down there,” she says. “C’mon, it’ll be more comfortable in bed.”
>Rox strips you down and throws the sheets back
>You’re dropped onto the bed unceremoniously and the covers are thrown over your head, instantly making you think back to the first night you spent with the wolfess and bird
>When you pull the covers off, Rox is gone
>Visually, anyway; you can feel her presence at the foot of the bed and hear her snickering to herself
>Then her pointed ears rise up over the edge, followed by her devious eyes and impish grin
>She lifts up the sheets and crawls underneath like a massive bedbug
>The wolfess smells your feet, your legs, and your thighs, working her way up your body
>Her fur drags over your skin and her weight presses down on you
>Suddenly she pauses, and you can feel her breath washing over your waist
>You recoil in surprise as her snout rams you sharply right between the legs
>”Heh, sorry,” Rox mumbles, giving your groin a few gentle pats
>The wolfess continues up the length of your body, sniffing and licking as she travels
>You try to decide whether this is supposed to be arousing or endearing, but you end up resigning to whatever she has in store for you regardless
>When she stops moving again, it’s for much longer this time
>Waiting…?
>You lift up the sheets to check on her once paranoia begins to set in
>The wolfess’ head rests on your chest, and she gazes at you innocently with those beautiful golden eyes
>”Hi.”
>Then she darts forward up to your head and flops onto you heavily
>You’re thoroughly pinned and at her complete mercy
>The wolfess smothers you, leaving just enough room for your head to get some fresh air
>”Just seeing how it feels to be the top dog for a change.”
>Isn’t she always, though?
>”Maybe I want to be the one held in YOUR arms once in a while, wise guy.”
>Rox huffs and bears her full weight on you even more
>Her arms sweep underneath you, pulling you into her mighty embrace and making you feel her powerful heartbeat
>Her nose pokes around inside your ear
>It’s cute until she decides to yawn loudly right into it
>”Wiped…out…” she groans. “Party planning really kicked my ass. Tomorrow’s going to be a ‘sleep in’ kind of day for sure.”
>Well, you’re clearly not going to be moving much until she gets up, and your body is already falling asleep from pressure
>So much for getting that “action” after your date
>”We’ll have the place all to ourselves again while Chee’s gone at work,” Rox whispers sleepily. “Might be able to sneak in some midday excitement after we recharge, alright?”
>Any protest you could make is silenced by Rox’s muzzle as she plugs your lips with a kiss
>”Night Anon. Love you….”
>You grunt back as best as you can
 
>It’s late morning by the time you wake up, body entirely numb and still restrained by the wolfess’ body
>Unlike the days you’ve woken up on top of her and perfectly balanced, you’ve been flattened into the mattress by Rox’s overnight tossing and turning
>Her mouth is glommed onto your face, hopefully not from an attempt at literally eating it off in her dreams
>”Nnnhhhaaa,” Rox moans, sucking on your cheek as she stirs from her slumber
>It’s her teeth that make you the most anxious, though they haven’t punctured your flesh yet
>Fortunately, her ringing phone saves you from such a fate
>”W-huh? Who’s…?”
>Rox gives you a brief, but crushing squeeze out of some semi-conscious panic that someone’s trying to take her human away
>She rubs the sleep from her eyes and then wipes the drool off your face after seeing how much she slobbered on you
>Any leftover grogginess is immediately shaken away when she looks at her phone screen
>”…Sher?”
>The tigress is calling Rox?
>You’re just as floored as she is—or “bedded” rather
>”Hey Sher, what’s up?” Rox says. “Wait, are you calling from your place?”
>…
>”Woah woah, easy. Yeah, I know you technically have two days off, same as everyone, but we never see you use the other so….”
>Rox’s eyes go wide
>As does the smile on her lips
>”Ooohhh, I see. Someone had a pretty great night and wanted to play hooky the next morning. Am I right?”
>Sherry-K doesn’t need to be on speaker volume for you to hear her frantic noises on the other side of the line
>Rox is biting her paw to keep herself from cracking up
>The raucous from the other end eventually dies down, and the tigress reverts to a normal speaking voice
>The humor in Rox’s face slowly fades as she listens, turning into shock and disbelief
>”He’s…t-tomorrow? Yeah, I…no, it’s no problem for us. We’ll be there. Do I need to wear my costume?”
>...
>”No, it was a joke, Sher. Alright, we’ll see you tomorrow.”
>Rox hangs up and lets out a long exhale
>She doesn’t even look at you for a while, instead settling back into bed and getting cozy
>Once again, any efforts to protest are stifled as Rox places a paw over your mouth
>”Shh, we’re sleeping in, remember?”
>So that’s how it’s going to be, isn’t it?
>You put your hands on the wolfess’ belly and dig your fingers into her fur
>It’s half aggressive tickling and half genuine massaging, but the outcome is 100% hysteric, vulnerable wolf girl
>”H-ha HA HA! OOOooohhh! A-alright! You win!”
>You spare her the torture, though your hands linger near her ears just in case
>Rox rubs her belly with her paw to ease herself down
>”So...” she pants. “Do you have any plans for tomorrow?”
>You give her a few warning scratches to get her to the point, but she throws herself on top of you to protect her weakness
>This time she’s less concerned about the amount of air you get while she smothers you
>”Like I was SAYING, we got a big opportunity lined up for tomorrow. Looks like we’re going to be meeting a certain head honcho of the whole flippin’ Whimsey empire....”
>You’d freeze up completely at the announcement if you didn’t have to worry about using your energy to keep the wolfess from suffocating you
>D. Whimsey Jr.
>Getting to meet him at long last
>Every fear and doubt you’ve had about this encounter comes back to you, along with some new ones
>He’s in control of one of the most powerful companies on the planet, and if he felt like your place in the secret world of the anthros was no longer necessary or tolerable he could easily have you taken out of the picture altogether
>It would be one thing if you had to meet the OG Whimsey man himself, but you know very little about his son
>Whimsey Jr. has made far fewer public appearances than his father, and rarely shoots promotional material for the park anymore
>He’s bound to have more secrets than just a bunch of animal people working for him, and you aren’t too certain you want to know what he’s capable of to ensure his secrets are kept
>”Nervous?”
>It’s hard to look Rox in the eye the way she’s on top of you, but her heightened senses can effortlessly pick up on how you’re feeling
>”Yeah, me too.”
>Rox grips you tightly, using you for security like a childhood stuffed toy
>”When Sher broke the news to us I saw this as just a kind of audition for our future jobs. But now...I don’t even know. I still think if we were in any serious trouble we would have already gotten our punishment, but there’s always a chance they could...could....”
>Rox’s claws sink into you uncomfortably
>”They’d better not separate us. They won’t!”
>That’s an issue that didn’t occur to you much yet either, but now it’s casting the biggest shadow over your thoughts
>Even if they don’t do away with you because of how much you know about the anthros, what if Rox’s new mascot position doesn’t end up needing a handler like you’ve been to her?
>What if she gets her own living conditions and her own backstage transportation, like some kind of celebrity removed from the public?
>You’d only ever see her when she’s performing, just like how every other human guest would see her
>Except while they’d be trying to see where the zippers and the seams of the “realistic” anthro costume are, you’d be trying to see the sadness in her eyes as she performs out of your reach
>Rox’s breathing gets heavier and her hug gets even more powerful
>Then she laughs
>”No...none of that. No more of that moping garbage. I’m not going to sweat our future together anymore, and I won’t let you do it either. We’re going to march into that old guy’s office and face him head on. And if he tries to tear us apart, I’ll knock his lights out!”
>What worries you is how serious you know she is about that
>You pet her for support and to pacify her, but she only sees it as encouragement
>”Yeah! Just because I’m in a fuzzy costume all day doesn’t mean I’ve gotten soft! You’ve never seen what years of holding back frustration from noisy, puking brats can REALLY make a wolf capable of!”
>Rox bolts upright with you in a headlock
>Her mind is gone in her fantasies now, which apparently include punching out beloved entertainment icons
>”Just you and me against Whimsey World!” she hoots valiantly. “Hell, maybe we’ll let Sher get a few swings in as well! That girl could use a little cathartic release from all the corporate bullshit.”
>Sherry-K doesn’t strike you as super eager to toss away her love of Whimsey just to enact some retribution, but she’s scrambled your expectations of her before so all bets are off now
>Rox continues her play-by-play of how she anticipates how tomorrow will go down as the two of you get ready for what no longer looks to be a quiet, uneventful day
>Maybe she’s forcing herself to stay positive—as positive as physical violence can get—in spite of her tenseness
>Whatever she’s doing, you’d much rather see this Rox than one who stresses about the things you’ve already shamefully let yourself get preoccupied with
>When she says they’re not going to split you two apart, you believe her
>You spend much of the afternoon still grappled under her arm
>Not for a moment does Rox lose that grit in her eyes or that smirk on her lips



[[ CHAPTER 25: What are Men to Rox and Mountains ]]

>It was a pretty restless night
>Chee came home from work to find the apartment a mess
>Mostly because of Rox and her inability to keep her excitement in check
>Furniture was turned over and there was a dent in the wall that wasn’t there before
>None of it you had any power to stop, since your neck was locked under Rox’s arm the entire time
>You expected Chee to be the voice of reason and condemn the wolfess for going crazy, but once Rox explained what got into her the bird ran around the apartment just as wildly
>”Roxie’s going to meet Mr. Whimsey!” she sang, acting like she wasn’t already aware this would be happening
>”We all are,” Rox said. “You’re coming with us.”
>Chee looked like she was about to die with shock
>”M-ME? I-I...but...I don’t really have any reason to meet him....”
>Rox pounced on the bird and grappled her into her other arm
>”Are you kidding, Chee? Even Sher knows you’re the real reason why Anon’s still living under our roof! If I weren’t already going because of the mascot thing, you can bet she’d want me as far away from Mr. Whimsey as possible so I don’t screw things up. Besides....”
>Rox’s grip on you tightened, and judging from the peep Chee made she got the same treatment
>”I’m gonna need my friends for this,” the wolfess continued. “Not just to keep me from doing anything stupid again, but because...well, it’s WHIMSEY. Standing up to the big guy himself isn’t like simply flipping over a couch.”
>She looked around the apartment at the damage
>”And I’ll...heh, I’ll clean that up myself.”
>Nobody could sleep much, but on the plus side the leftover energy carried through the night and into the morning
>All three of you eagerly wake up early like it’s Christmas Day and you know there are presents in the living room
>Presents you have to painfully wait for since the three of you aren’t expected to meet up with Sherry-K until closer to noon
>Rox isn’t eating much breakfast, so Chee has to practically stuff chunks of waffles into the wolfess’ mouth
>”You need to eat something, Roxie!” the bird pleads. “You get grumpy when you don’t have food in the morning!”
>”Do noff!” Rox says with a muffled growl
>Everyone gets cleaned up; multiple times even in the case of your roommates
>Every time the bathroom becomes available someone else runs in to comb another mat out of her fur or brush down a disobedient feather
>The hour ultimately arrives, and you all take Chee’s car over to the park grounds
>The bird is shaking heavily, and Rox’s paw is on the steering wheel to aid her almost the entire trip over
>Sherry-K is already waiting for you in the employee parking lot by the time you arrive, with trusty clipboard in hand and an exceptionally large stack of papers secured to it
>The tigress looks to Chee
>Chee looks to Rox with worry
>Rox in turn opens her mouth to argue why the bird came along
>But Sherry-K preemptively stops the wolfess’ explanation
>”She can come along, Roksa,” the tigress says coolly
>”I…wait, really?” Rox says
>Sherry-K nods
>”As long as she’s here, she may as well. Chee has been an important part in watching over Anon, just as you have, and her testimonial to Mr. Whimsey may help Anon’s case for being fully integrated into our society.”
>”I’ll give him my best word!” Chee says, patting you with her wings
>”You’ll give him your HONEST word, I hope,” Sherry-K says sternly. “That goes for you as well, Roksa. I want this to go smoothly just as much as you do, but being transparent and truthful with Mr. Whimsey is of the utmost importance right now.”
>”Don’t worry, Sher,” Rox says, “I’ll say exactly what’s on my mind.”
>The tigress’ eye twitches as Rox squeezes her shoulder
>The four of you then pile into Sherry-K’s car, with Rox riding shotgun and you and Chee in the back
>Sherry-K hastily cleans the dashboard off of all her Whimsey memorabilia
>”You really need some help,” Rox mutters while Chee giggles
>Guess the tigress hasn’t made a lot of headway in decluttering her life like she wanted to
>Rox digs a paw into the passenger seat and roots around
>“And you might want to give these back to Mionra, too….”
>”W-what!?” Sherry-K blurts out loudly, accidentally slamming the car horn along with her outburst
>But Rox sticks out an open, empty paw
>”Only messing with you, Sher.”
>”Roxie!” Chee scolds, pecking her in the back of the neck
>The car hasn’t even left the parking lot and it already feels like an agonizing family road trip to Whimsey World
>The trip is anything but long, however, as your destination is right within the Cast Complex grounds nearby
>All of the bickering and horseplay ceases completely as the four of you sit nervously outside of the largest office building
>The whole car takes a deep breath in unison
>”Everyone ready?” Rox says after a lengthy pause

>There’s an almost unsettling tranquility in the hallway leading up to the office
>It’s shockingly barren of Whimsey décor, but a few old photographs occupy the walls
>Even the no-nonsense Sherry-K is stalling a bit, examining the pictures rather than making a beeline toward the room where Whimsey Jr. awaits
>All of the photos have the senior D. Whimsey, and many of them include anthros of various species
>It’s surreal to see the legend himself standing next to creatures you had no idea existed almost a month ago
>You sadly expect that most of these individuals have passed on by now considering the age of the photos, though one particular picture of Whimsey and a young male goat grabs your attention
>Even with several decades shaved off, the anthro is very clearly the same goat coordinator you met the day you had to venture out to Sherry-K’s place
>It’s actually a little surprising that Sherry-K manages to have the authority she does with the goat obviously having far more seniority than her
>Then again, maybe the elder goat is perfectly content with where he is right now
>He certainly looks thrilled beyond belief just to be standing next to and working for such a renowned man like D. Whimsey
>”You recognize that kid?” Rox whispers into your ear
>She elbows you repeatedly in the side with a quiet snicker
>Sherry-K beckons the rest of you along to the end of the hallway, where a much larger picture hangs above the office door
>The iconic photo of D. Whimsey and his smiling beagle Chobbo
>It’s undeniable to you now that Chobbo was more than just a regular pet dog
>Sherry-K opens the office door, and the four of you nervously step inside the office
>Almost a dozen anthros of various types stand beside a large conference table, each with an immaculate business suit and an intense stare waiting for you
>You haven’t seen any of them before, and you get the feeling they either work far behind the scenes of the park or they aren’t related to Whimsey World at all
>They could very well be spokesmen or even government officials to the greater anthro society outside of the company, meaning they’re the ones who would inevitably be deciding your fate
>You try to avoid eye contact with them for now, but it’s difficult to miss the predatory sight of an older, yet burly male tiger
>He looks from you to Sherry-K, who’s trying her hardest not to return the gaze
>…You’ve seen him before somewhere, haven’t you?
>”Thanks for coming in today, friends!” a kind voice greets you
>Standing at the head of the table is Darwin Whimsey Jr., looking like an exact (albeit older) duplicate of his father
>Sharp features, well-groomed, wide smile, and displaying his seasoned age with grace
>The whole room lights up with his charisma
>He struts over and shakes everyone’s hand, paw, or wing in turn
>Chee looks like she’s going to explode with giddiness the moment Whimsey touches her feathers
>”H-h-h-hi Mr. Whimsey! M-m-my name is Chee and I’m ahugehugefanofeverythingyoudo!”
>She clamps her beak shut, but Mr. Whimsey gives her a warm, reassuring chuckle
>When it’s your turn for a handshake Mr. Whimsey gives you an amused look, as though the only other human here is the oddest thing in the entire room
>”Well, Anon!” he booms. “To be frank, I was a little afraid to meet you.”
>Him? Afraid?
>The man certainly doesn’t look like he has ever stressed a day in his life 
>”It was my father’s dream to bring all of us together,” Mr. Whimsey continues, motioning to everyone around him, “and when he passed away it was a dream entrusted to me to carry on. But…with how little progress we’ve made since then I believed it would be up to my own children to see that dream realized, or even my children’s children. Just a few weeks ago I never would have imagined I would need to confront this issue so soon.”
>As Mr. Whimsey speaks, one of the anthros hobbles up from behind him with a cane in paw
>Chobbo
>The beagle has greyed significantly and his face is full of wrinkles to the point of looking like it’s melting, but it’s unmistakably the same dog you saw in the well-known photograph just moments earlier
>”Pleased to meet you, Abben,” Chobbo says gruffly
>”That’s ‘Anon,’ Chobbo,” Mr. Whimsey says mirthfully
>”Hmm? Ah, right. Sorry, Nona.”
>Even with his eyes nearly blinded by his drooping brow, you still manage to see the dog wink playfully at you
>Chobbo gets his own round of handshakes in before Mr. Whimsey directs everyone to sit at the table
>It’s hard to shake the feeling that you’re in some kind of legal court, especially with all the unknown anthros staring at you like a ruthless jury
>”Mr. Whimsey, thank you again for taking the time to meet with us today,” Sherry-K says
>Her own anxiety might be just as bad as everyone else’s, but you’re thankful to have someone like the tigress on your side who can keep herself cool and professional
>Though she’s sitting pretty rigid, and you suspect it might be because of the other tiger who keeps eying the two of you up
>”I should be the one thanking YOU, my girl,” Mr. Whimsey replies. “As I said, I was pretty worried when Anon just dropped into our laps like that, but now I’m relieved you took the initiative and decided to jumpstart the human integration project. A hundred thanks!”
>Surprisingly, the suited anthros around the table nod in agreement, but Rox looks a little peeved
>She opens her mouth to argue, but Chee gives her a swift kick under the table
>The wolfess’ grunt doesn’t go unnoticed, though
>”Now now,” Mr. Whimsey says. “We didn’t forget about you, Ms. Rox. I’m looking forward to speaking about what we have in store for you as well. Ms. Sherry-K showed us the tapes of your performances with Anon, and I dare say you could potentially be one of our star attractions!”
>Rox suddenly jumps to her feet
>Chee gasps and Sherry-K tries to restrain her, but despite the tigress’ size it’s Rox who looks like she has the strength advantage
>The room goes chillingly silent for a moment
>”Mr. Whimsey!” Rox barks. “Before you say anything else, there’s something I have to lay out here right now.”
>Dammit, Rox...
>There are frightened and even a few angry looks around the table, but Mr. Whimsey himself sits with a blank expression
>Something you’ve never seen from him or his father
>The wolfess takes a deep breath
>”Anon and I have been through the best and worst of it together,” she says. “I’ve done all I can to help him get used to our way of life, both in the park and out of it. We’ve become a perfect team together, you saw for yourself...and we’re the GREATEST duo you have. That’s a PROMISE!”
>Rox leans over to you and puts her paw on your shoulder
>You get that familiar feeling of being pulled by her into something you have absolutely no control over, but the weight of Rox’s touch also seems to anchor you to safety 
>”I’m not leaving Anon, ever. So no matter what you have lined up for me for the future, if there’s no room for Anon in your plans then I don’t want any part of them!”
>Everything’s quiet again, except for the faint sound of Chee’s scared whines
>Rox stares Mr. Whimsey down, while he just looks back unblinkingly
>Then Chobbo bursts out into laughter
>”BWOHOHO! What a livewire! You should look at your face, Darwin! I haven’t seen that expression since the first time you had a guest scream at you without your old man around to save your hide!”
>The dog slaps Mr. Whimsey on the back, and the rest of the table tries to suppress joining in on the infectious laughter
>You expected SOME reaction from the human, but maybe not joking defeat
>”You’re right, my friend,” Mr. Whimsey says with an exaggerated sigh. “Upset guests were something I saw my father put up with time and time again, but you never really know how you’re going to deal with it yourself until you’re the one who has to make the call alone…the one who has to make the situation better. It was an important first lesson in how to keep everyone as happy as possible when you’re running the happiest joint on the planet.”
>He looks to Rox with genuine respect
>”And...I’ll admit,” Mr. Whimsey continues, “perhaps I got a little too comfortable with the routine after a while. A free night at the resort or some merchandise giveaways...it’s all too easy to get the average patron to turn around their sour mood. But a fellow employee—no, a friend? One of our best entertainers to boot? Well, that’s something I have far fewer opportunities to deal with....” 
>Chobbo nods through the whole speech
>The wolfess was probably expecting a less jovial response, and might have even psyched herself up for a literal brawl with the guy
>Rox lets herself be pulled slowly back down to her seat by Sherry-K, and her ears fold back in shame
>”Ms. Rox,” Mr. Whimsey goes on, full of smiles once more. “I thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention. Fortunately, I think we can come to an agreement that everyone will be happy with in the end! Before we cover that matter, however, I would like to quickly go over the situation with Anon while I still have the rest of my lovely guests held hostage here.”
>The suited anthros shuffle their papers around nosily in acknowledgement
>”Mr. Shearod-K, would you please?”
>Oh...
>The male tiger stands up and clears his throat
>Out of the corner of your eye, you see a certain tigress fidget uncomfortably
>”Mr. Anon,” the burly tiger rumbles. “Our organization understands that you have expressed interest in entering our communities outside of the sanctioned employee housing affiliated with Whimsey World; communities which normally prohibit humans from entering with the exception of chartered circumstances relating to the Whimsey-Aesop Living Treaties as highlighted—“
>If there were any mystery where your favorite Whimsey head coordinator got her elocution from, it’s completely gone now
>You try to sneak the tigress a discreet glance, but you catch a death glare hidden in those grassy eyes and quickly look away
>The older tiger drones on for a while in legalese
>You briefly wonder if this some kind of test, where failing to hold on to the feline’s words for even a second means you’d free to be preyed upon by every hunter at the table
>Fortunately, the monologue eventually gets to a part that concerns you directly
>”—And so you will be given a probationary visa which will allow you into our communities, provided you are always accompanied by a guardian. The Whimsey Corporation will designate who these guardians are and will be responsible for their behavior just as they are with yours.”
>”I see a few perfect candidates already!” Mr. Whimsey says, looking to Rox and Chee
>Your roommates press up against you affectionately
>With the speech over, the suited anthros rise to leave
>”We’ll have your papers ready in a few days,” Shearod-K continues as the crowd files out of the office. “If you have any questions or concerns, we have a line of communication in Whimsey with whom you may speak to in order to contact us.”
>He raises an eyebrow toward Sherry-K for emphasis, then walks up to her
>The tiger drops his voice, though you can still make out the conversation
>”Your mother has been hoping you could stop and visit soon. We would like to treat you in honor of your promotion.”
>”I’ll consider it,” Sherry-K mumbles. “I’ve been very busy recently....”
>The older tiger nods, then follows his colleagues out
>You have to avert your eyes to spare yourself from another of the tigress’ death glares
>Now it’s just you, her, Rox, Chee, Chobbo, and Mr. Whimsey left
>”Well then!” Mr. Whimsey says with a loud clap. “I’d like to go over our plans for Ms. Rox and the mascot initiative, but I was thinking we could take a bit of a trip. Get out of this stuffy room, of course. Why don’t I take you all on a tour of what we have in store for the park’s future?”
>”That sounds lovely,” Sherry-K says. “Thank you, sir.”
>Mr. Whimsey waves off the formality
>”Bah, we can leave that behind. Please, call me Darwin. Chobbo does it all the time.”
>”I usually call him on the phone, though,” Chobbo says flatly
>Rox snorts
>”I like this guy!” she whispers to you
>You follow the two company heads out of the office, where Mr. Whimsey pulls out his phone and makes a few quick dials
>The rest of you give him and Chobbo some space
>Rox hangs back to chat with Sherry-K
>”So what’s the big deal?” the wolfess mutters to her. “You suddenly taking the credit for keeping Anon around?”
>The tigress lifts up her nose
>”As I recall, that was part of the bargain, was it not? If management accepted Anon’s place in the company, you would ‘let me take the credit’, right?”
>”You DID say that, Roxie,” Chee whispers
>Rox shakes her head and scowls
>”If it pleases you any,” Sherry-K says dryly, “I was initially reprimanded myself for allowing this to happen without upper management’s approval. Your little wager was irrelevant; someone had to take the fault for Anon’s situation, and with YOUR record I couldn’t let you be the one to do it.”
>Rox winces
>”Damn, Sher...no, that doesn’t make me happy at all. Look, I’m really—“
>Sherry-K cuts her off yet again
>”Roksa, please spare me. You wanted this friendship to work, didn’t you? Well, you should be able to handle a little banter now and then.”
>The wolfess scoffs in response
>”If that’s your idea of ‘banter’, girl...woof.”
>You see a small grin curl on Sherry-K’s lips
>On the other side of the room, you think you see one from Chobbo as well



[[ CHAPTER 26: Glam Rox ]]

>Just a few minutes after Mr. Whimsey gets off the phone, a colorful limousine rolls up to the Cast Complex
>The windows are mirrored, making it impossible to see anything on the inside except for the costumed driver on the inside
>Stockcar Squirrel from the looks of it, though whoever is truly on the inside is a mystery
>Poor guy (or girl) probably doesn’t have a lot of visibility under that mask
>You’d be a little worried that someone who can’t even see well is going to be driving you around the park...that is, if you were just a guest
>But you know from company insight that most of the specialty vehicles like this one would be self-driving
>It gives the illusion that a character is at the wheel for all the entertained onlookers, but with none of the risk of being visually impaired
>Mr. Whimsey gives a friendly wave to the driver and opens up the passenger doors for everyone
>It’s thankfully a roomy interior for the sake of bigger anthros like Rox and Sherry-K
>Chee bounces on the seats as though she’s excited for an actual ride in the park
>Everyone settles in comfortably and the limo pulls off for a tour of the grounds
>Before anyone else can say anything, Rox jumps in
>”Mr. Whimsey,” she says, “I…want to apologize for the outburst back there. It was way out of line, and I—“
>But the company head just holds up his hand with a smile
>”Don’t worry yourself over it, my girl. And like I said, call me Darwin, please! You were only concerned about the future; it’s perfectly understandable! I myself was a bit of a troublemaker back in the day. Not even nepotism could save me from the threats my father made for if I hadn’t shaped up around the park. In fact, I was demoted quite a number of times, as I recall. Whimsey World may put families first, but my father considered EVERYONE part of his family, and the way I acted was not fair to the rest of my ‘siblings’.”
>Chobbo laughs heartily
>”To be fair, we were partners in crime!” the aged dog says. “You can’t take all the credit for the mischief we got into!”
>”Wait,” Rox says. “Both of you? Working together in the park?”
>”Oh yes,” Mr. Whimsey says. “Just boy and dog.”
>He gives you and Rox a wink before continuing
>”Couldn’t leave Chobbo alone because he’d get lonely and upset. So, we dressed him up in a costume and put him to work just like everyone else.”
>Chobbo scoffs loudly
>”Bah! It was YOU who begged your old man with tears in your eyes to make me work. I was more’n happy to crawl around behind the scenes and watch you sweat your caboose off!”
>The dog leans forward slightly, as though trying to speak to you and Rox discreetly
>”Speaking of which,” he whispers, “I saw your names in the guest book you-know-where. Thanks for humoring an old mutt and his little ‘pet project’!”
>”What on Earth are you talking about?” Mr. Whimsey says
>Chee looks absolutely confused while Sherry-K gives you and Rox the glare of someone ready to dole out reprimands at a moment’s notice
>”Hmm? Ah, I forget,” Chobbo says with a shrug. “Never mind me!”
>The dog just laughs it off
>Seems like even Mr. Whimsey himself doesn’t know about the secrets of “Rox World”
>Or “Chobbo World”, as it’s probably been referred to many times in the past
>The limo takes you all through the park grounds, through gardens and past curious guests
>You don’t seem to be going anywhere in particular physically, but as you watch Mr. Whimsey’s face scrunch up contemplatively you begin to see he’s working up to something emotionally
>”Yes, my dear old friend has had to hide for far too much of his life…same as ALL of my friends who can’t properly enjoy the park from the surface.”
>Mr. Whimsey’s eyes fall squarely on you, soon drawing the focus of everyone else
>”How much do you know about the history of the park? Of where our dear friends here with us today came from?”
>It’s not worded as an accusation, but suddenly everyone’s eyes wanders around to see if anyone’s going to speak up and confess that they told you something they shouldn’t have
>All you can tell Mr. Whimsey is what you know about the park from your job orientation and general knowledge
>In other words, only things humans know
>Mr. Whimsey accepts your answer with a nod, and your fellow coworkers look relieved
>”A testament to how well our secrets have been kept all these years, I suppose. Though there are days I wish they had been simply leaked to the world, just so this whole charade can finally be done with….”
>Mr. Whimsey gives Chobbo a thoughtful grin before he continues
>”Our two societies have had minimal contact since, well, the beginning. We were skittish of one another at best and hostile at worst, and it wasn’t until the days of Aesop that timid bonds were made.”
>Aesop?
>”One of the original ‘secret-keepers’ and mediators, yes, and a massive inspiration to my father. He was such a legend with his stories that our friends often call themselves ‘Aesop’s Children’ to honor him.”
>No objection from any of the anthros in the vehicle, though their reactions range from interestedness to (in Rox’s case, no surprise) indifference
>Guess even some anthros don’t really care so much about their own history
>”When my father was a young boy,” Mr. Whimsey continues, “he had an encounter with a young mouse girl…so I’ve been told. He was very secretive about the details, and to this day I know very little about her. It was during the final days of my father’s life that I learned most of what I do know.”
>The limo goes silent
>Mr. Whimsey gazes out the window pensively
>When he speaks, it’s the first time he doesn’t look into someone else’s eyes with life and emotion
>”My father loved my mother, and I didn’t doubt that for a single day. However, there was always that subtle fleck of sadness in the corner of his eye, and now I know why. He lamented never having the chance to be with the mouse girl who caught his heart first. When he grew older, my father tried tracking her down; he must have met every single mouse in the world EXCEPT her. Though heartbroken, it ultimately led to something positive.”
>Off in the distance, you can see the spires of Whimsey Castle
>”Darwin Whimsey Senior…my father dreamed of bringing everyone together: all humans and all of Aesop’s Children. He crafted stories and movies about the two societies living as one, and every message he delivered to the world about peace and respect had deeper meanings than most listeners ever understood. He wanted this park to be the place where that dream was realized. Now, it’s up to us to decide whether it’s a dream worth fulfilling.”
>The junior Whimsey looks back to you, this time with a serious expression
>”I won’t hide this from you, Anon: we have done…regrettable, terrible things in the past to keep our worlds apart until we felt the time was just right. You are by no means the first human who has stumbled upon secrets we were not ready to reveal just yet, but you ARE the first who has lasted as long as you have.”
>You can feel Rox inch closer to you protectively
>Sensing the tension, Mr. Whimsey tries to raise the mood of the vehicle back to normal
>”And now you’ve changed how we plan on handling human interventions in the future, Anon. We want this to work. We NEED this to work. We will still have to take things slowly, but I want to see the progress being made with what little time I have left. Right, Chobbo?”
>The beagle jumps out of a nap
>”H-wha-? Erm, right, right. A garbage can every twenty-seven feet. I agree!”
>Rox and Chee break out laughing, and even Sherry-K has to hide her mouth behind her clipboard
>Chobbo gives a dopey smirk with self-satisfaction, while Mr. Whimsey shakes his head
>It’s evident though that the two of them have been through an extraordinary amount together
>The limo soon pulls behind a building you’ve never seen on the grounds before
>”Ah, great, right on time!” Mr. Whimsey says
>Once parked, he opens the doors for everyone graciously
>”Watch your step, old friend,” he murmurs to Chobbo
>The dog has a little trouble getting out of the vehicle
>”Old coots like me are the reason the ride lines are so long,” Chobbo chuckles
>The group walks slowly to let the elderly beagle keep up, but it’s worth the slow pace to see what this new building has to offer
>”This is one of Whimsey World’s R&D departments!” Mr. Whimsey says proudly. “Not one of the human-operated ones, of course, though the employees at this facility still contribute new technology and marketing techniques for the entire company.”
>It’s a very simplistic, clinical looking building, but the way he describes it is enough to get a gasp of wonder out of Chee
>”Today, we’re here for Ms. Rox,” Mr. Whimsey continues. “I think you’ll ALL enjoy what the boys and girls have been working on recently….”
>The wolfess drapes an arm around your shoulder
>”Can’t wait!” she says, giving you a squeeze

>You’d think such a popular, important man like Mr. Whimsey would cause awe, excitement, and maybe a little a few nervous bystanders to back away with fear
>But all the anthros in the R&D complex simply welcome him like an old friend
>Meanwhile, all that awe, excitement, and fear is directed toward you
>As usual, word of who you are has long since reached every corner of the theme park, but this is the first time many of these anthros are seeing you up close
>Fortunately, you have Mr. Whimsey around to placate the situation
>”Everyone, this is Anon!” he says to all those listening. “If anyone would like to meet him, you know the drill: form an organized line, wait your turn, and we’ll set up pictures and autographs!”
>...Is he joking?
>Doesn’t really seem like it, and a few anthros even start to head on over to take him up on the offer
>”Don’t worry, buddy,” Rox whispers to you as she pats you on the chest. “You’ve been an amazing handler for me since I’ve known you, so now it’s my turn. I won’t let any crazy fans maul you to pieces!”
>That’s a little reassuring
>Rox makes a pretty good bodyguard, all things considered
>It isn’t long before the other anthros are more hesitant to approach “the human” because of her rather than because of you
>Still, a brave few risk the wolfess’ wrath and come up to meet you
>They’ve all seen humans before—clearly—but there aren’t likely many mascot performers in the R&D labs where they have a chance to make actual contact with humans
>Some gleefully shake your hand while others looks like they’re only coming up to you as a dare
>In any case, Rox is right there counting the seconds
>She looks ready to chase off anyone who spends too much time speaking with you
>You might have to help her work on her people skills later, or teach her how to share
>To her relief, Mr. Whimsey shoos the crowd away after a few minutes
>”Alright, give the poor man some space,” Mr. Whimsey chuckles. “We’re here on an important mission today for Ms. Rox!”
>He leads you and the others through the labs, which is very much an “organized mess” of brainstorming and planning all done right out in the open
>You know they have tours of the human-run Whimsey R&D buildings (though they’re incredibly expensive and difficult to get into), but it’s still surprising to see all the anthros so candidly working on new Whimsey projects
>How much of what they come up with ends up just being credited to the humans?
>Just as how Rox is your personal handler, it seems like Sherry-K has to be Chee’s
>The bird wanders a little too closely to the desks and worktables as you pass by them, trying to take sneak peaks at whatever she can and leading the tigress to have to constantly give snarls of disapproval
>Of course when she’s done corralling the bird back to the rest of the group, Sherry-K has a peep of her own, followed by hasty scribbling on her clipboard
>Workplace professionalism can’t stop a true Whimsey fan from geeking out
>The tour of the facility goes on for a while, though it’s not done intentionally so much as it’s because of how far back the true destination is
>Mr. Whimsey’s excitement in showing this off is clear, especially as he opens the door to a new workroom with a flourish
>”And this...this is where we’re developing our new line of mascot characters!”
>You can’t tell whether his smile or Rox’s is bigger
>Canvases, projectors, and a sea of drawing papers fill the studio with sketches and concept art
>Every anthro in here has a pen or a brush in their paw
>Except the few with tape measures in the center of the room, surrounding a display of mannequins made in the shapes of several different animal species
>The mannequins are each dressed in exuberant prototype costumes, making the display look like a lineup for superheroes
>One of the models has very distinctly canine dimensions; female ones, particularly
>The costume itself is a hodgepodge of layers and colors, making the whole thing seem like someone from the distant future trying to mash together every “rock star” trope from over the decades and patch it up with sci-fi wrapping
>It doesn’t look like there would be much openness to see the fur of the wearer underneath, but that is probably intentional for keeping the illusion that someone like Rox would still be a human in an anthropomorphic wolf costume
>The wolfess slowly pads up to the mannequin and takes the whole thing in with an open muzzle
>Once the nearby designers get over the initial confusion of a stranger in their studio, they realize she’s the one who they’re creating for
>A few bold designers even creep up to her and whip out the tape measures and begin to record Rox’s proportions while she continues to stare at her future persona
>Mr. Whimsey leans closer to you
>”Do you think she likes it?” he whispers
>He seems to already think so
>But if there was any doubt in his mind, then it’s removed by Rox’s frantically wagging tail
>Chee hops in place with giddy squeals at the sight of her happy roommate
>Sherry-K’s absorbed in her clipboard, but the motions seem too broad to be writing
>Is she...drawing?
>Rox spooks the measurers as she whips around with a goofy look on her face
>”I love it!” she barks. “When can I start?”
>Mr. Whimsey laughs
>”Soon, I promise. We still have some details to finalize, and then we have to do casting calls for your backups and performers in other parks. I believe Tokyo Whimsey already has a few eager young wolves lined up!”
>Rox’s muzzle can’t possibly contain the size of her grin
>She isn’t just being hired along with others for some new role; it’s that the others are being hired for HER role
>The joy only falters for a moment with some brief nagging doubt
>”So, do I still have to do an audition or something first?”
>”Not necessary,” Mr. Whimsey says
>He points to another part of the room where Rox’s prototype costume designs are being worked on
>There’s a cluster of tables with several television monitors, each one with a still shot or a looping video of the day you and the wolfess did all those ride-alongs in the park
>”I think the evidence speaks for itself,” Mr. Whimsey goes on. “It’s as Ms. Sherry-K told me: you are easily one of our top performers! And you work so well with someone like Anon at your side, which is another reason for the delay in getting you ready for the role....”
>A paw claps you on the shoulder, but this time it’s from Chobbo
>”Darwin and I knew growing up working together in the park that we made the perfect duo!” the beagle says. “Lookin’ at the two of you go at it out there, though...I’m a little jealous! I think we found a pair that can run circles around us!”
>Hearing him say “go at it” gives you a momentary pang of guilt
>Hopefully Whimsey park’s cameras didn’t pick up on you scratching Rox in the chill room
>Or you kissing her on Little Happy Planet
>”Indeed,” Mr. Whimsey says. “It isn’t enough to have our friends like Rox out there to slowly get the humans used to them existing. We need to have her AND a human out there as a team to really get the point across! Which is why we’re making a role specifically for her character to accompany; a sidekick, if you will!”
>Wait, YOU?
>Both Whimsey and Chobbo nod
>”We’d like you to be there with her, Anon,” Mr. Whimsey says. “After all, Ms. Rox clearly has reservations about this new opportunity if it doesn’t include you in them. Isn’t that what you said?”
>Rox chuckles sheepishly
>”Y-yeah, that’s right!”
>Once again, she has just pulled you into something completely unexpected
>You can probably do a decent enough job as a performer, but Rox is leagues better than you could ever be by far
>”Granted, I will confess that you will essentially be continuing your position as a handler for her,” Mr. Whimsey adds. “Same as all the other humans who will be paired with their wolf partners. We can’t give them a major role in this setup, as we still don’t want them being TOO involved with the performers just yet. I can tell it’s already going to be an even bigger headache casting for the handlers than it is for Rox’s character. We need to make sure those human sidekicks aren’t going to be blabbing to the world about our little secret until we say it first.”
>A proper show of gratitude would be to shake Mr. Whimsey’s hand, but Rox grabs your whole body and shakes YOU instead
>”Thank you, Darwin! Thanks! I won’t let you down!”
>She clearly isn’t going to let you down either, literally
>The group laughs at her excitement, and the nearby designers join in as well
>When the commotion dies down, only Chobbo’s wheezing cough remains
>”Are you alright, my friend?” Mr. Whimsey says with some concern in his voice
>”Bah, just all the loose pencil shavings floating around,” Chobbo says. “I don’t know how all these young’uns can stay locked in here all day. Much rather be out there in the fresh air...even if I have to wear those damned masks!”
>The group laughs again, though it’s a little more subdued this time
>You’re allowed to take a tour of the studio as well for a little while
>Chee takes full advantage of the opportunity, pestering every artist and designer she can find
>They eventually have to bribe her with sketches of her favorite characters just so she’ll leave and they can get back to their (mostly) peaceful work
>Rox still has you in one of her token embraces as you return to gawk at her soon-to-be new costume
>Your attention switches over to Sherry-K when she makes a yelp of surprise
>Seems she might have been a little too absorbed in her clipboard when Mr. Whimsey approaches her
>You can’t pick up on what he whispers to you, but he looks just as eager about whatever it is
>Sherry-K’s eyes go wide, and then she nods vigorously
>”O-of course, sir,” you can hear her say. “I’ll let them know at the next meeting. Thank you.”
>The tigress spends the rest of the visit with her back to the walls, so that she can’t be snuck up on again
>You stay for a little bit longer, and then Mr. Whimsey collects everyone to head back out
>You’re finally pried out of Rox’s grip so that the company head can take both of you under each of his arms
>”I know the two of you will do us all proud,” he says
>It sounds as if he’s holding back some emotion while he speaks
>”If there’s anything I can do for either of you, please let me know. The only thing left I can ask for in this world is to see my father’s dream come true. I still haven’t been entirely...forthright with my own children about our two societies, but I aim to correct that as soon as possible. I just hope that they—and the rest of the world—are as accepting of this kind of unity as the two of you have been.”
>Rox sniffs and nods
>”You got it,” she says, also sounding a little choked up
>The limo ride back to the Cast Complex feels as short as a monorail ride
>You share a few more handshakes with Mr. Whimsey and Chobbo
>These then turn into full-on hugs
>Chee looks the most broken up about the day finally being over
>Like the trip home from the family visit to Whimsey World, Sherry-K’s car is somber and quiet
>Rox eventually breaks the silence when you return to the employee parking lot
>”Hey, Sher,” she says. “So what did the big guy say to you? Did ya get promoted again already?”
>The tigress just clears her through and shoos everyone out of her car, carefully replacing some of the Whimsey knickknacks she had knocked to the side
>”I’m surprised you didn’t eavesdrop on THAT announcement as well,” Sherry-K says sarcastically
>”Yeah, well, didn’t that time lead to something great?” the wolfess replies
>”Hmm, I suppose it did. This will as well, but you will have to wait until the next meeting like everyone else to hear it.”
>”If I didn’t know better, Sher, I’d say you’re almost pleased with yourself about something.”
>The tigress smirks



[[ CHAPTER 27: Rox Lobster ]]

>The conference hall is filled with roughly half of the park’s anthro employees
>The commotion still isn’t enough to wake Rox, who’s leaning against you so heavily you have to actively fight against her to remain upright yourself
>Sherry-K called for a park-wide meeting for the anthros before the start of first shift, which means Rox had to get up even earlier than normal
>You look beyond the wolfess to where Chee is sitting, giving her a pleading look to help you
>”Roxie, wake up!” Chee says, shaking her roommate
>The wolfess just leans into you even harder
>”Nnnggghhh, five more minmmm…” she groans
>You’re starting to get funny looks from everyone around you
>A few minutes later, Sherry-K marches out to the front of the conference hall and the room goes silent
>NOW Rox wakes up with a jolt
>She looks around worriedly like a student who just got caught napping in class
>”H-hey, hey, what’s going on?” she says to you with a nudge
>”Roxie, shh!” Chee says
>There seems to be a general feeling of unease among the anthros
>Why would so many employees be called here unless something’s wrong?
>The dread is wiped away instantly when Sherry-K brings up an image of a familiar waterpark on the projection screen
>Whimsey Waters
>The room murmurs loudly
>At least until Sherry-K raps her claws on the clipboard, and everyone goes quiet once more
>”As you all know,” the tigress begins, “Whimsey Waters has been under renovations for the past several months, and will soon be reopening to the public. Operations of the waterpark will continue to be largely the responsibility of the human sphere of the company.”
>Figures as much
>There are very few mascot characters who get to hang out at the waterpark, and it’s not like there are a ton of rides for anthros to work behind the scenes on
>You bet there were a lot of anthro employees happy it’s been closed purely out of resentment of the humans
>You’ve been to the waterpark a couple of times before, but usually by yourself
>”However....”
>That one word from Sherry-K immediately shifts the mood of the entire room
>The seats in the conference hall creak as everyone shifts to the edges in anticipation
>”The reliability of the improved water filtration systems will still need adequate testing. It is expected that the new filters should be able to handle debris and particulate matter of any volume, including large quantities of hair or fur.”
>”No way…” Rox says in a hushed voice
>”Mr. D. Whimsey Jr. has thus decided to simultaneously test these systems as well as reward everyone for your admirable performances over the season by allowing access to Whimsey Waters for employees until its reopening.”
>An uproar breaks out in the conference hall
>Clapping, cheering, whistling...
>Squawking, trilling, howling…
>You should have given yourself more time to brace for the mass of dark gray fur that envelops your head as you’re yanked into Rox’s excited embrace
>It’s hard not to feel a little happiness for the anthros
>They’re finally getting their chance to enjoy a part of the park they’ve been excluded from for possibly the entire company’s history
>Sherry-K fruitlessly tries to calm everyone down
>She gives in and lets the crowd get it all out before continuing
>This must be that big secret she had when you met with Mr. Whimsey, judging from the hint of a smirk she has on her lips
>But that smirk dissolves into a more serious expression
>”It should be noted that we will only have access Whimsey Waters a few times each week up until its grand reopening, and for a few hours each day. We currently do not have the trained staff or volunteers in sufficient numbers to operate the waterpark the entire week.”
>You can feel a little bit of the energy drain out of the room, though it’s not enough to completely dampen the spirits
>”We will soon be posting schedules for waterpark accessibility. I urge those interested to take advantage of this opportunity while it is still available. As of right now, it does not appear that Whimsey Waters will be open for Cast Nights due to safety reasons.”
>Dejected noises fill the conference hall
>”Boy, Sher really knows how to let them down easy,” Rox grumbles
>”But we should still be grateful for what we have,” Chee says
>Sadly, not a lot of others are probably going to see it the same way Chee does
>And yet, they don’t have much of a choice
>Sherry-K goes on to cover a few more less-important announcements
>Rox grabs you and Chee and pulls you both in closely
>”So, what do you say?” she whispers. “Whimsey Waters; first chance we can on everyone’s day off together. How about it?”

>The waterpark isn’t as big as Whimsey Park, but with its winding paths and thick foliage it feels like it is
>Much like its counterpart, Whimsey Waters is separated into multiple themes ranging from tropical paradise to glacial coast
>In reality, a lot of the slides and attractions are duplicated several times throughout the waterpark with only the backdrop serving as the major difference in each of the themed zones
>That’s a non-issue to most of the anthros who show up along with you, Rox, and Chee on the weekend
>Everyone looks perfectly content just to be out in the fresh air during sunlight
>Then again, there are a lot of embarrassed anthros who seem to be having second thoughts about showing up in front of their coworkers wearing bathing suits
>Rox has no such reservations in her bikini, which is so dark that it almost blends into her fur when the glare of the sun hits your eyes
>Chee on the other hand is wearing a much more modest, somewhat antiquated, frilly bathing suit
>No doubt Whimsey merchandise of some variety, like their “princess line” of swim clothing
>Your suit is nothing special, though Rox seems determined to keep it loose on you
>Her nails dig in and tug your waistband when everyone else is preoccupied
>”Looking good, stud,” she purrs in your ear
>Everyone is gathered near the wave pool in the center of the waterpark
>A pretty healthy crowd showed up today, with several familiar faces
>Before everyone is let loose into the waterpark, Sherry-K addresses the group by a billboard map of Whimsey Waters
>She’s easily the most conservatively dressed one of the bunch with her ruby red lifeguard shorts and shirt
>The mirrored sunglasses actually make her a little intimidating, and instead of her usual clipboard she’s clutching a blindingly reflective whistle
>She gives it a shrill blow to quiet everyone down before speaking
>”Alright everyone, listen up!”
>Though just as serious, her tone seems a little different than the stuffy professionalism she’s so comfortable with
>”We only have the waterpark to ourselves for a few hours, and because of our limited staff during these periods we will be restricted to certain sections on rotation. Our volunteers will be monitoring the slides and rides a few at a time, and each half-hour we will shift to another spot. This will ensure we get the chance to test every facet of Whimsey Waters at least once.”
>”Great, it’s like a stupid field trip,” Rox sighs
>Her paw works it way around your waist
>”Guess we have to follow the buddy system, right? I got mine right here!”
>Sherry-K points to the wave pool on the map and traces the layout of the waterpark in wide circles
>”We’ll begin at Rascal Rapids, then move on to The Slush, and work our way clockwise. You may return here to the wave pool or the lazy river at any time, and this is where we’ll meet at the end of the day. Be alert for this sound.”
>The tigress pops the whistle into her mouth and lets out an ear-splitting sound
>If you didn’t know better, you’d think she’s going to be enjoying that thing
>She heads off toward Rascal Rapids with a sizeable chunk of the group following her
>Only a small portion of the anthros hang back to get used to the wave pool first
>”Hey, do you guys want to start with the wave pool, or maybe take a lap around the river?” Rox says to you and Chee
>Chee looks legitimately shocked by the wolfess’ suggestion
>”What? Really?” she chirps. “But, those are what we should end the day with! I want to do all the fun slides first!”
>”Yeah, but come on, Chee. Look at this group! Everyone has the same idea, and the lines are going to be long as hell to start with. Don’t you want to come back to the slides later?”
>”Not really...” Chee pouts
>Rox rolls her eyes
>”Fine, we’ll wait in line all day with the rest of the group, if that’s what you want.”
>You can’t help but laugh
>It definitely feels like the three of you are on vacation, as guests to Whimsey for a change
>The bittersweetness of the situation already tries to take hold, but you push those thoughts aside and try to focus on the positives of the moment
>Rascal Rapids has a lot of the more intense slides, with many of them created specifically for pairs
>”Should we rotate every slide?” Chee says
>”What? Why?” Rox says
>She grabs you around the waist even tighter, protectively
>”Because we have an odd number, Roxie! And I want to get a chance to ride with both of you, too!”
>The wolfess doesn’t look ready to share you quite yet
>She looks around the group of anthros, then hones in on someone with a sly grin
>”Why don’t you take HIM with you? I think someone wants to be your slide buddy!”
>His cover blow, the spying pheasant tries to duck among the cover of the other anthros
>”Hey, Amadeus!” Chee calls out. “Hey! Over here!”
>The oriole flaps her wings as she works her way through the crowd to catch the retreating pheasant
>Poor Ace
>”Perfect,” Rox chuckles smugly
>The silky leather of her paw pads runs over your skin
>”Got you all to myself. At least for a little while.”

>Just like Sherry-K alluded to, only a handful of the anthros are trained lifeguards
>Or at least were willing to supervise the rides while everyone else gets to have fun on them
>Not much of an issue for the tigress, who always seems to get more than her share of enjoyment from being the leader and authority figure
>”You going to come down some of the slides with us, Sher?” Rox asks the tigress when you finally make it to the top of a tube with an inflatable, “figure 8” shaped raft in hand
>”Not today,” Sherry-K says flatly
>”No, TODAY,” Rox says right back. “We’ll get you on something here before the end of it.”
>”Hmph. Good luck with that.”
>You set the inflatable down at the top of the slide and Rox coaxes you to the front half
>”I’d better take the rear,” she laughs. “’Bigger rider’ and all that, you know.”
>The wolfess drops down behind you, almost launching you off your seat from the sudden displacement
>Her legs hook around your body and rest on top of yours
>”See, Sher? Doesn’t this look fun?” Rox says coyly
>The wolfess locks her arms over your torso and draws you back against her
>Sherry-K just places a foot on the back of the raft and kicks off
>Rox lets out a sudden yelp of surprise as the two of you careen down the slide
>But she’s soon hooting and yelling in joy as you rock and turn down the tube
>The enclosed sections echo her noises, and she sends a long howl down ahead of the raft
>You join in, howling right along with her
>It’s not a long slide, but the two of you come out of the bottom with complete satisfaction
>Rox lets out one more holler as you both slip off of the raft and into the collecting pool
>She’s already looking hilariously soaked thanks to all the splashing waters and rapids
>”What’s so funny?” she says
>The wolfess shakes herself vigorously, whipping the water from her fur like any dog would after a bath
>You wait a minute for Chee and her partner to follow
>The two birds comes shooting out the end with differing expressions
>”Again! Again!” Chee says
>Ace on the other hand had his eyes covered with his wings the whole time
>”Y-yeah, sure. Just let...let me....”
>The wobbling pheasant tries to gracefully exit the raft, but ends up flopping into the pool
>Chee reaches into the water and fishes him out with a giggle
>She whisks the reluctant, dripping Ace back up to the top while you and Rox hang out at the bottom for a while
>”Well, that was a good time, yeah?” the wolfess says
>Wait, she’s done already?
>It’s true that Rox didn’t seem to be big into the rides during Cast Night in Whimsey Park, but you’d think she wouldn’t be far behind her roommate in wanting to do the more thrilling stuff here in Whimsey Waters
>None of the slides seem to grab her wild side, though
>Not even the 17-story free-fall body slide that looms over the whole place
>”Hey, if you want to have another go, lead the way,” Rox says. “I know I call the shots a lot when it comes to us hanging out.”
>You can tell from the way her tail swishes side to side that she knows something else the two of you can do instead
>And that she knows YOU know that she knows
>”On the other hand...I was right, wasn’t I? That took WAY too long to stand in line for, and if you want to hit the slides again we might as well wait for everyone else to get tired, yeah?”
>Rox wraps her arm around you
>Even though her fur is still a little wet, it hasn’t lost any of its softness
>”Meanwhile, I bet nobody’s going to be in the lazy river. Whatcha’ think?”
>You’re already being led along by the wolfess before she’s even done speaking
>Not like you were going to resist her anyway
>Being the tamest attraction in the waterpark, the lazy river is indeed all but ignored right now
>Only the black and white mass of fur belonging to Cookie can be seen on the winding river circuit
>The panda is completely asleep, yet carefully balanced on a small inflatable doughnut like a scoop of ice cream spilling over the top of a cone
>You and Rox let him drift farther ahead before getting into the water yourselves
>A long rubber raft floats into reach, but Rox shoves it away before you can grab it
>”Oh no you don’t. We’re only going to need ONE.”
>Rox drags the biggest raft she can find over to you and pulls herself onto it
>And then pulls you onto her
>The wolfess lies on her back with you balanced over her, just like so many nights you’ve spent in bed together
>The two of you rock along on the water’s surface as the raft settles in
>Eventually, everything calms down and you’re floating along weightlessly
>”Mmmmuch better,” Rox sighs
>Your head rests on her chest as she gently rubs her paws over you
>It’s a completely serene environment, with only the distant screams of joy from the anthros to interrupt the ripple of the water and the breeze in the trees
>”Just like we’re on vacation, huh?”
>It almost sends a chill up your spine just how closely her thoughts mirror your own
>”Sher’s right. We should take advantage of this while we can, ya know? After all, someday this park is going to be filled to the brim with both of our kinds, sharing this place together...right?”
>Rox hugs you firmly
>She’s obviously getting a little sentimental about the future, but as her grip gets even stronger she lets out a throaty chuckle
>”I’m sure we’ll always have Rox World for a private getaway, though. Then we can come back here later when we want to bring the whole fa—“
>She goes quiet
>You and Rox drift together for what feels like hours, but when you catch a passing map marker along the side of the river you see you aren’t even halfway through the endless cycle
>Every so often she’ll dip her paw into the cool waters and then run her paw pads on your skin
>”Feel nice?”
>Of course she does
>Her muzzle darts in to plant a kiss on your cheek
>”Pfft. I meant the water,” she groans humorously. “But thanks.”
>Time goes on, with you and Rox still intertwined
>It’s like you’re floating along the very face of a clock
>She stops all your attempts to shift around, fearing you’ll want to leave the river
>The sun gets tired of waiting for you to leave the river and instead makes the first move, taking away the rays beating down on your closed eyelids
>The gradually cooling afternoon makes Rox’s fur all the cozier to be snuggled against
>But the paradise has to come to an end at some point
>You hear the light tapping of approaching claws on stone
>”There you are!”
>You open your eyes to see Chee skipping along the side of the river after your raft
>”I was wondering where you two disappeared to!” the bird says. “Didn’t you want to go down some more slides?”
>Rox makes a groan similar to the ones she makes every morning she’s woken up by her roommate
>”Could say the same for your friend Ace. What happened to him?”
>”I think I wore him out,” Chee says sadly. “He’s taking it easy by the wave pool. Roxie, can’t you and Anon do a few slides with me? Pleeease? It’s almost time to head home....”
>”Alright, alright,” Rox says
>Your world is jostled around as the wolfess sits upright, nearly launching you into the pool
>”We’ll go down a slide or two,” she continues. “BUT...we need to get our favorite coordinator in on this, agreed?”

>The wave pool is littered with anthros bobbing up and down like buoys
>High on a lifeguard’s chair, Sherry-K is surveying the scene
>Perhaps focusing a little too much on a particular vixen who’s backstroking along not far off...
>Rox sneaks up to the tall lifeguard’s chair and shakes it
>”Yo, Sher!”
>”WHAT, Roksa!?” Sherry-K snarls down at her
>”Come with us for one last slide for the day, alright? We want to do the buddy tubes and Chee broke her partner.”
>You spot Ace passed out on one of the lounge chairs
>Though spent of all his energy, you’d have to be blind to miss the content look on his face
>Sherry-K looks to each of you in turn
>”I’m on duty,” she says matter-of-factly. “I need to be here to keep an eye on things.”
>”I see at least two other lifeguards out there!” Rox says, motioning to the wave pool. “I think everyone here is adult enough to not drown while you go down a quick slide, so don’t worry about it.”
>Rox has a tendency to make people feel the opposite when she says “don't worry”
>Sherry-K clearly isn’t moved by the wolfess’ assurance at first
>But when she opens her mouth to object, Rox cuts in with a sweeter deal
>”I’LL even be your buddy for this one, Sher!”
>”I’m seeing Mionra right now, Roksa,” the tigress says, seeing through Rox’s implications
>”Yeah, I know you are. You’re not fooling anyone with those sunglasses. Now get off your fuzzy butt and come have fun with us!”
>Even while wearing those mirrored shades, Sherry-K’s brow arcs so intensely you’re sure she’s doing a pretty impressive eye roll
>”ONE slide, then we’re packing up for the day,” she says
>Sherry-K barely makes it down to the ground before both Rox and Chee grab her and march the tigress back to Rascal Rapids
>Rox tosses the figure-8 inflatable over Sherry-K’s body to keep her arms pinned to her sides
>”Up you go!” Rox says as the four of you ascend the stairs
>”Roksa, this isn’t safe!” Sherry-K growls, feebly trying to grab the handrail
>”You weren’t safe the moment you let us abduct you, Sher.”
>Once at the top of the slide, Chee sets down your own inflatable and hops into the front
>You set yourself into the back spot while the two other girls get ready in the staging lane next to you
>”Well if you’re going to be a stickler for rules, I guess you’ll have to be in the rear,” Rox says. “You’re a little bigger than me, girl.”
>”I beg your pardon?” Sherry-K scoffs
>”Meet you two at the bottom!” Chee sings
>The bird pushes off and the two of you soar down the slide
>You don’t go as fast this time since she’s a lot lighter than Rox is, but at least being in the back gives you a different perspective
>Chee giggles and cries out the whole way down
>You imagine this has to be one of several dozen trips she’s made on this slide alone today, yet she continues to have full enthusiasm for the experience
>By the time you make it to the bottom you’re just about ready to crash right beside Ace from all the collateral excitement
>”Wow, what a rush!” Chee says. “Thanks for being my partner, Anon!”
>You both quickly vacate the pool to watch for your other two friends
>The wait isn’t long
>You hear Rox’s laughter and Sherry-K’s wailing long before the wolfess and feline make it all the way down
>Their inflatable smacks against the water with a loud slap, and Sherry-K’s half sinks dangerously under her weight
>The whole thing nearly tips over, and the tigress lunges forward to stay upright
>Grabbing Rox’s chest in the process
>The wolfess’ face contorts into a mix of shock and amusement as Sherry-K unwittingly cops a feel
>”Bad kitty!” Rox chides
>It takes Sherry-K a moment to realize what happened, but when she does the tigress recoils back
>Leaning away dangerously
>NOW the whole thing tips over, sending the two girls into the pool
>Chee is laughing hysterically
>Rox is positively beaming when she resurfaces, while Sherry-K rises from the water like a striped, crabby monolith
>Her lifeguard uniform is utterly soaked, as is the sour look on her face
>”Welp, I think that was a good way to end the day, eh?” Rox snickers
>The wolfess grabs the whistle from around Sherry-K’s neck and gives it a wet blow
>The tigress’ ears twitch at the pitiful sound while Chee continues rolling around in stiches
>As Sherry-K wrings her uniform dry—slapping away Rox’s paws when the wolfess attempts to assist her—she gives you an unfavorable look
>The look that says somehow this is all your fault



[[ CHAPTER 28: Jailhouse Rox ]]
 
>You and Rox return home from work to find your other roommate sitting at the table with booklets and folders sprawled all over
>She’s so absorbed in her work that it actually surprises you how long it takes for her to greet you
>And even then, she barely looks at you and Rox
>”Hey guys,” the bird says absentmindedly
>”Geez, Chee,” Rox says. “Did you spend your whole day off just reading? You looking for a ‘bookworm’ or something?”
>Elbow to your ribs
>”Uh huh...huh? What?” Chee says
>Chee suddenly animates and looks around, gasping at how dark it’s gotten outside
>”O-oh! It’s a lot later than I thought!” she giggles sheepishly
>Rox picks up one of the booklets and flips through it
>The cover looks familiar to all the literature you collected during your “new hire orientation” when you first got the job in Whimsey World
>”So what’s all this stuff anyway?” Rox says. “Homework?”
>”It’s for my training as Senior Supervisor of Park Operations!” Chee sings. “I don’t want to disappoint Sherry-K for promoting me.”
>Chee reaches over to a spot on the table where a pristine uniform is still folded up in plastic packaging and gives it a few pats
>If Chee didn’t have to wear the uniform for work, you imagine she would have already framed it up on her wall
>”You don’t have to sweat anything,” Rox says. “Sher was right to trust you, and we all know you’ll do a good job. Plus, it’s nice to know we have someone working her way up on the inside to make some ‘changes’ for us down the road....”
>Chee puffs up her cheeks and gives Rox a disapproving look
>The wolfess immediately backs down
>”H-hey, I was just messing with you!” Rox says, waving her paws. “I’m not gonna make you do anything to break the rules, I swear!”
>Chee nods in satisfaction
>Good to know she’s still going to be the responsible one of the pair
>Though if Chee rises through the ranks you can bet she’ll try to make the park more fun for everyone to work in
>That bird has a really promising future in the company, but hopefully she won’t get burned out the same way Sherry-K did
>It makes you wonder just how bright-eyed and hopeful the tigress herself was before the stress of the company got to her
>Now you’re picturing Sherry-K’s body with Chee’s personality
>Rox pokes you in the cheek with her claw
>”What’s with that look on your face?” she says with a laugh
>Chee closes up all her booklets and folders, and then stretches with a long yawn
>”What a fast day!” the bird says. “We’re all going to be pretty busy soon with our new jobs!”
>”All the more reason to enjoy the days we have off together,” Rox adds, kicking her feet up on the couch and grabbing the TV remote. “You want to watch something with us, Chee?”
>”Maybe another night,” Chee says with another yawn. “I’m supposed to be at work a little earlier tomorrow.”
>”So much for that plan,” Rox grumbles. “Not even if we watch one of your favorites?”
>”Sorry...goodnight you two!”
>Even with a busy day behind her, Chee still manages to head to bed with a little pep in her step
>”I tried,” Rox sighs as you join her on the couch
>The TV goes largely ignored as the two of you cuddle for a while
>Rox tries rubbing her paws over your earlobes
>”Does this do anything for you?”
>Well, it doesn’t feel bad
>Probably doesn’t feel anywhere as intense or erotic as it does for her, though
>Rox huffs and tries to rub harder
>You have to turn the tides on her to get her to take it easy, scratching her ears and the back of her head
>As usual, it completely disarms her
>”Ooooaaaooohhh...that’s sssooo not fair,” she moans
>You tease her a bit as she helps you get to her hard-to-reach spots
>She tries to fight back, but when you move your hands under her shirt to her belly she just sticks her tongue out
>Feeling her powerful muscles flexing and relaxing through her soft fur is something you’ve grown to enjoy almost as much as she does
>Rox seems far less like an actual wolf when you have her wagging her tail and kicking her leg around
>”We domesticate too, ya know,” she eventually grunts as you massage her stomach. “Not like we’re all wild animals anymore.”
>You brace yourself for some kind of anthro lecture, but it never comes
>Though a part of you is somewhat curious to hear “their” take on it; how they see themselves in a world where humans see regular animals for what they are
>But fortunately, Rox seems to take it all in stride
>”I never paid much attention in school,” she laughs guiltily. “So I don’t really know a lot about where we come from, or our ‘ancestors’ or whatever. All I know is I love all this ‘human stuff’, and I can’t help but love your scratches, too. So...you better get in their deep, buddy!”
>Rox flips you over onto your back but holds your hands to her belly
>She forces you to rub at a vigorous rhythm for a while before she trusts you to continue on your own
>Kneeling over you, Rox slathers your face with kisses while you perform your duty
>The wolfess stops just long enough to where you think she’s going to say something, but then a shiver or a gasp ends the pause and she’s right back to her kissing
>This goes on for quite some time
>That is, until Rox is finished and her heavy body drops on top of you
>”Alright,” she pants. “Time for bed.”
>Her arms hook underneath you, and you feel yourself being lifted off of the cushions
>But rather than picking you up, Rox is merely rolling you on top of her
>And then the two of you roll off the couch
>You have just enough time to brace yourself before you and the wolfess topple to the floor with a loud thud
>”Roxie? Anon? You guys okay out there?”
>Rox just snickers in your ear
 
>It’s a long-running joke to many (and an urban legend to a few) that Whimsey World has a magical anti-weather bubble surrounding it
>The park manages to avoid the worst storms and conditions, and it has almost never closed in its many years of operation because of it
>Unfortunately, this supposed “bubble” doesn’t stop the occasional downpour, and the rains won’t stop Whimsey World from running
>On a dreary day like today, it’s a mixed bag
>The good news is that you and Rox don’t have to be out entertaining the guests in the sweltering sun
>The bad news is that the guests still want to see the mascot characters, rain or shine
>The next outdoor public appearance of Rox as Whirly Barf is cancelled, but you can bet you’ll soon be stuffed into a gift shop or restaurant with her among several other characters so the guests can get their photos and autographs anyway
>It’s all a matter of waiting for the coordinators to make the arrangements
>In the meantime, you and Rox are just waiting backstage in boredom
>She can’t take her mask off (still being in essentially “human territory”), so she’s still hamming it up in “goofy mascot mode” to let off some steam
>The wolfess offers you an umbrella, then snatches it away before you can grab it
>Then she bops you on the head with it a few times
>Things quickly devolve into a tug-o-war
>You’re fighting over the umbrella when a human coordinator slides in backstage to get out of the rain
>”Nice boxers,” Rox says to him
>The young man looks down and curses
>Whimsey’s costuming department makes their uniforms extremely thin and lightweight, both to keep the wearer cool and also to cut costs
>This means that when they get soaked, they tend not to hide what’s underneath much
>Like the human coordinator’s heart-printed boxers under his now transparent slacks
>Rox does her best to stifle a laugh as the coordinator covers himself with his clipboard and slinks off
>When he’s gone, she turns to you
>Her paw rests on your lap and her fingers drum on your leg
>Even with the dead, blank eyes of the Whirly Barf mask, you can tell Rox is giving you a mischievous look
>”Hey Anon, I think I left, uh, something outside. You want to go out and find it for me?”
>Not gonna fall for that one
>You use the moment to try and take the umbrella away, but Rox’s strength is unyielding
>”Nah, you don’t need this. I’m sure you’ll be back in no time.”
>Having your coworker try to get your pants wet has to be some kind of workplace violation
>”You can complain all you want,” Rox says. “Sher isn’t here to save you with her rules and reprimands.”
>Just then, your radio chirps
>It’s your savior...sort of
>Rox scowls as you answer the radio and hear a familiar tigress on the other end
>”Anon. Are you with Rox?” Sherry-K says
>”Not if I have anything to say about it,” Rox mumbles, still trying to shove you out the door and into the rain
>”I would like to speak with the two of you in my office as soon as possible,” Sherry-K continues
>The horseplay stops immediately
>”Aw shit, what did we do now?” Rox says
>There she goes again, not sharing her umbrella but more than willing to share the blame
>So the two of you make your way deeper through the employee tunnels into the anthro-only ones
>Rox is pensively quiet during the trip, but she can’t help but swat you a few more times with the umbrella
>When you make it to Sherry-K’s office, Rox walks toward the tigress with open arms
>”Come clean, Sher. You just wanted a little one-on-one time with ol’ Whirly Barf, didn’t you?”
>The tigress sighs
>”No, Roksa, I called you both here because...h-HEY!”
>Rox has a slight size advantage even over Sherry-K when in the costume, and her bulky costume fluff engulfs the feline in a hug
>”Aww, it’s alright, princess,” Rox coos. “Why don’t you tell your good friend Whirly who your FAVORITE Whimsey character is, hmm?”
>Sherry-K mutters under her breath
>”Sorry, didn’t quite catch that,” Rox says
>”...Whirly Barf...” Sherry-K mutters a little louder
>”Wait, really?”
>It kind of surprises you as well
>For how much Sherry-K seems to love the company, you would have thought she’d have the same fascination with the princesses that someone like Chee does
>Rox slowly lets go of the tigress and removes her mask
>Underneath is a wicked, wolfish grin
>”Wow, Sher. If I didn’t know any better, I’d say it’s YOUR fault I get stuck with this slobbering dog more often than anyone else.”
>Wait for it...
>”Oh, and also why I get the Whirly Barf costume all the time!”
>Rox pats you on the head to the rhythm of a rim shot
>Meanwhile, Sherry-K looks like she’s either jealous of the attention or miffed that she’s being called out for what Rox is accusing her of
>Maybe a little of both
>”You are simply the most qualified for the character role,” the tigress says flatly. “As you know, we assign the costumes based on employee size, and you just happen to fit the dimensions of the character appropriately enough. I see no reason to change up your role frequently when you are already acclimated to this one in particular.”
>”Is that so? Well, if I didn’t get stuck with him BECAUSE he’s your favorite, then is it because of ME that he’s your favorite?”
>Sherry-K’s tail curls in frustration, and you can practically imagine her orange fur turning red
>”That’s enough, Roksa,” she hisses as calmly as possible. “Save your banter for another time. As I was about to say, I called you both here to give something to you that recently arrived.”
>Sherry-K hands you a small pile of envelopes and what looks like a passport of sorts
>The front cover is emblazoned with [Whimsey-Aesop Living Treaties] and an overly complicated insignia
>Rox also gets her own, smaller stack of papers
>”This is the probationary visa my...rather, Mr. Shearod-K mentioned at the meeting with Mr. Whimsey,” the tigress says. “Included are credentials for the three of you: Anon’s visa for access to our communities, and guardian licenses for you and Chee. You are both representatives for the Whimsey Corporation when accompanying Anon, and are thus expected to conduct yourselves with the same discipline as you do here.”
>”’More discipline’ in my case, right?” Rox says sarcastically
>”I was not going to go there, Roksa.”
>Rox looks at the papers ecstatically and grabs Sherry-K’s paw to shake
>”Thanks for everything, Sher. I mean it! We couldn’t have done this without you! You’ll have to thank your old man for us too, alright?”
>Sherry-K’s nostrils flare a bit
>”Please, just promise me you’ll both be careful. PLEASE. If you need any help at any time, don’t hesitate to ask me. I’m registered as one of Anon’s guardians as well. Everything we do from this point forward is going to face indescribable scrutiny, and we’ll all be facing more than simply reprimands if something goes wrong. Can I put my trust in the two of you?”
>There’s a subtle, pleading look in the tigress’ face
>”Y-yeah...yeah, Sher,” Rox says solemnly. “You got our word. We’ll be careful, I promise.”
>Sherry-K nods gratefully
>”Thank you. You are dismissed for now. We will be moving your three ‘o’clock meet-and-greet to the Little Happy Planet plaza if the current weather conditions persist. I would recommend making your way over there unless otherwise instructed.”
>Rox gives Sherry-K one more—much more reserved—paw shake before you and her head out of the office
>”Well, at least we can give the good news to Chee right away,” Rox says
>She keeps her mask off as you walk through the anthro tunnels so you can see her beaming muzzle
 
>The apartment has a predictable liveliness after work
>Chee hasn’t stopped squealing in joy since Rox broke the news to her
>You could swear you even heard her from her perch in the Little Happy Planet ride while you and Rox were down in the plaza
>”This is super exciting!” the bird says as the three of you gather in the living room. “We’ll have to put in some time off and show Anon around!”
>”You sure you’re alright with it, Chee?” Rox says. “Don’t you have some new responsibilities with your position now?”
>The bird makes a whining sound
>”Yeah, but...I mean...I really want to go with you guys....”
>”Hey, I want you to come with us,” Rox says, putting an arm around her friend. “I just don’t want you to get in trouble. It’s like you said yourself, we’re all going to be really busy with our new jobs. This is just a for-fun sort of thing. Work is more important, I get that.”
>Chee nods sadly but tries to force a smile
>”Anon’s not going anywhere without us...literally,” Rox continues. “There’ll be other times. And besides....”
>Now it’s her who looks broken up about something
>You can feel her paw search out for you, needingly
>She doesn’t continue speaking until she knows you’re close by
>”...Well, if we’re going to be staying somewhere for a while, we might have to stay with someone we know to save a little money on travel. You know, like...maybe someone’s parents.”
>Chee opens her mouth to speak, but Rox immediately cuts her off
>”No, not your folks, Chee. I mean, maybe not at first. They’re too far away, and I don’t want to suddenly dump Anon on them again so soon. I know you were going to offer, but thanks any.”
>”But, Roxie...do you mean...?”
>The wolfess nods
>”Yeah, I guess so. I’ll have to break the news to them eventually. Might as well get it over with.”
>Chee looks from Rox to you, and then back to Rox
>Everyone looks uncomfortable
>”Your parents aren’t, uh, together anymore though, right?”
>”No, no they’re not....”
>Rox takes out her phone and just holds it in her paw
>Staring at it like a pet that just died in her grasp
>Her chest billows out with a large inhale, followed by a powerful sigh
>”Anyone got a coin to flip?”



[[ CHAPTER 29: Rox Climbing ]]

>The good spirits in the living room have all but deflated
>You and Chee sit on the couch in silence as Rox paces around the apartment
>The wolfess’ claws tap away at her phone sporadically, making the only noise in the whole room
>Every so often she’ll stop and stare off into space, motionless and blank
>Then she’ll resume her tapping as though nothing happened
>”Roxie, are you alright?” Chee says worriedly
>Rox snaps out of her trance with a sudden jolt, almost confused to see you and Chee still around
>”Huh? Oh, sure. Just...figuring some things out.”
>”About your parents?” Chee says, her mouth behind her wings as if bracing for her words setting the wolfess off
>But Rox just sighs heavily
>If there’s any emotional baggage the girl has left, it’s probably regarding her folks
>It seemed to be the catalyst that led to her breakdown back up in Whimsey Castle, and as far as you know it’s the only issue of hers she hasn’t really been able to confront or resolve yet
>Admittedly, you knew deep down that this day would have to come eventually, too
>The anthros may do a good job of keeping themselves hidden from humans, but nothing slips by them when it comes to what goes on in their own domain
>It’s a miracle you haven’t had to confront Rox’s parents yet, but you’ll have to do it soon
>And someday, when humans and anthros finally begin to interact with one another, you might have to introduce Rox to your own friends and family
>”Yeah,” Rox says. “I have no clue how I’m going to break it to the folks about Anon. As far as they know, I’ve never actually seen him up close before.”
>Rox has been pretty secretive about taking phone calls with her parents, usually excusing herself from your company if she can’t avoid it anymore 
>”It’s not like I’m really that close to them anymore, but if they hear I’m dating a human and the news ISN’T coming from me before someone else....”
>Rox looks at you with concern
>”I don’t exactly want to just trash what little connection I have left with them, you know?”
>Chee squirms around in her seat
>”Do they really not like humans that much?” the bird says
>”I mean, no more or less than anyone else,” Rox says. “But they’re kind of, well...heh, ‘old fashioned’ I guess. Even after they split they both kept asking if I had found a mate yet, and my mom was way worse of the two. She didn’t just say ‘boyfriend’, she flat out wouldn’t settle for me having anything other than another wolf.”
>Rox just stares at you, as if wanting to apologize in advance for her parents’ prejudices
>But the longer the wolfess looks at you, the less concern she has in her eyes
>Now Rox has that resolute, confident air about her that you’ve seen ever since she knew you were her perfect mate
>Ever since she knew you had the same feelings for her as she had for you
>After about a minute of tense silence Rox claps her paws together loudly, making Chee jump off the couch
>”...Which is why I’m only giving each of them one fucking chance to accept Anon,” Rox says. “And if they don’t, we’re walking out. I’ve made a life out here without their help, and I wouldn’t take back any part of it. I already have all the family I could want right here.”
>Rox stomps forward with a swiftness that makes Chee gasp out in fright
>She grabs you and the bird and pulls everyone together for a group hug
>You’re smashed into Chee just as strongly as you are against Rox
>”R-Roxie...urrk, t-too tight!” the bird gasps
>The wolfess just chuckles, maybe a bit oblivious to just how much crushing force she’s using on her roommates
>”I love you guys,” she says, lifting you both up and swinging you around. “I really do. Same with all the other poor souls who got stuck with us in all this. I love them all!”
>You’re more than a little lightheaded when Rox finally decides to put you down
>Chee staggers around the living room, flopping back onto the couch with a moan
>”Heh, my bad, Chee,” Rox says, scratching her neck
>The world stops spinning after a few minutes, and the three of you settle back down to enjoy the rest of the night as much as you can
>Unfortunately, the future still hangs heavily in your minds
>”So, when were you thinking of taking Anon to see your parents?” Chee says
>”Sooner rather than later,” Rox sighs. “I’d like to get this over and done with before the mascot initiative starts up. I don’t need both things stressing me out. I’ll talk to Sher and see what we need to take care of. Maybe we’ll take the trip next weekend.”
>Chee whines sadly
>”I don’t think I can get off of work so soon for that,” she says. “Can’t you wait a little longer, Roxie?”
>Rox takes Chee’s wings in her paws, forcing a weak smile
>”Sorry, Chee. I don’t want this to turn ugly with my parents, but if it’s unavoidable then I sure as hell don’t want you to have to be there to watch it. Better get all the drama out of the way first. Like I said before, there’ll be other trips. We won’t do anything too fun without you, I promise. It wouldn’t be the same without you there, anyway.”
>Chee nods in understanding and the two girls share another — much gentler — hug
>Now you’re feeling a little left out
>Rox is quick to pick up on your rejection
>”Aw, get over here, buddy,” she says, beckoning you over
>Being sandwiched between fur and feathers is much cozier when you’re not getting the life squeezed out of you
>”Please don’t get Anon into any trouble, Roxie,” Chee says once the hug breaks
>”Sure thing, mom,” Rox groans
>The wolfess is right: this is definitely her family right here in Whimsey World
>And yours as well

>You and Rox drop in on Sherry-K’s office the next day during work
>”Never though I’d be coming here so much,” Rox mutters humorously. “Pretty soon I’ll have been here more times by choice than for reprimands.”
>From what you’ve seen of the wolfess’ record, that won’t be happening anytime in the near future
>...Uh oh
>Maybe it wasn’t a good idea to say that to her
>”You calling me a delinquent?” Rox growls
>Try as you might, you don’t have time to dodge the wolfess before she puts you in a headlock
>She runs her teeth over your scalp lightly, pretending to gnaw at your head but making it feel more like awkward kisses
>”I’m a good girl,” she says matter-of-factly. “You say so yourself!”
>Well, yeah
>Mostly because she asks you to call her one when you give her belly rubs and ear scratches
>Rox pats the spot on your head she was chewing on, rubbing away the saliva
>Though it takes her a moment to remember to release you as you’re dragged into Sherry-K’s office
>The tigress knows you were coming, but she still cocks an eyebrow at Rox anyway
>”If you wish to spend time in this office so badly,” Sherry-K says, “then might I recommend applying for a coordinator’s position?”
>”Only if you swap with me and become a performer,” Rox says back. “I think you’d make a really lovable mascot, Sher. I know I’D give you a hug.”
>”Hmph. I’ll have to keep that in mind. In any case, what was it the two of you wanted to see me about?”
>The joking comes to a stop and Rox puts on a more reserved demeanor
>The wolfess has certainly matured in several ways since you first “met” her; mainly times when she knows she needs to be serious
>”Anon and I want to go into the city on our next day off and see my folks,” Rox says. “Since we haven’t done this yet, we figured maybe you could help us make sure we’re not making any mistakes.”
>Sherry-K opens her mouth to say something, but then pauses with her ears folded back
>”I’m...glad to see you’re being responsible about this, Roksa,” she says. “I truly mean it. A part of me was worried you were going to just rush over there without any sort of warning.”
>You kind of thought so, too
>”Something bothering you, Sher?” Rox says
>It’s a rare occasion that the tigress puts down her paperwork and addresses you with her paws folded calmly
>”Although we have been given the authority and privilege to accompany Anon outside of Whimsey grounds, I have been explicitly instructed to report to the Whimsey-Aesop Living Treaties when he plans on leaving our direct supervision for the first time.”
>”So, what, they’re just going to know we’re coming?” Rox says
>”It will be...a little more involved than that,” the tigress says. “Unfortunately, a representative from W.A.L.T will have to accompany you during admissions, primarily to welcome you as well as preemptively ablate any complications or panic from having a human wander around the city.”
>”Oh, great...so we get to have a chaperone? Who’s it going to be, then?”
>The tigress looks noticeably uncomfortable
>”Mr. Shearod-K volunteered to oversee your trip.”
>Oh boy...
>You look to Rox expecting (though hoping not) to see her on the verge of cracking a joke or a grin, but rather she just looks surprised
>”Wait, your old man?”
>Sherry-K breathes in deeply
>”Roksa, Anon...please understand. We’ve already been thoroughly cautioned about our delicate role as representatives for the Whimsey Corporation. However, when I ask you to be as careful and as responsible as you can, I’m asking this for personal reasons.”
>Her brow softens, and there’s a pleading look in her grassy eyes
>”My father was a major driving force in my being hired into the company. My rapid advancement coincided with the budding plans to integrate humans into our societies, and so once Anon discovered our organization I was hastily elevated to where I am currently.”
>Sherry-K deflates as she lets out all the air in her lungs with a long sigh
>”Sometimes I DO envy your role as a performer, Roksa. There isn’t a moment that goes by where I don’t worry about how my actions will impact my family’s name. There isn’t a day that goes by where I don’t resent how nepotism has interfered with how I genuinely wanted to advance by my own merits and prove myself to my peers.”
>Rox nods in sympathy
>”Yeah, dealing with family can be kind of a pain sometimes, huh?”
>The wolfess walks up to Sherry-K and offers her arms for a hug
>The tigress makes no objections
>”That’s why you gotta make your own family sometimes, Sher,” Rox continues, holding the feline in her arms. “We’re here for you; all of us are. Won’t even force you to clean your room or anything like that.”
>”That’s something I’ve been meaning to do as well...” Sherry-K grumbles, giving you a quick glance
>”What was that?”
>”Never mind.”
>Rox pats Sherry-K on a the back a few times before motioning you over to the embrace
>”Feels like I’ve been giving these out a lot lately,” Rox chuckles
>”Roksa....”
>”Yeah?”
>”If I could ask one more thing: please don’t divulge too much to my father about my personal life.”
>”You got it, Sher. I’m no gossip.”
>Sherry-K gives you the same pleading look, as if making the same request
>You give her a reassuring nod in return

>The last night of the workweek is spent packing up for the weekend
>You and Rox prepare for a two-day trip to the closest anthro city, Moreau
>There isn’t much you need to pack, fortunately
>”I’m sure we can get by without taking a lot of extra stuff,” Rox says. “We won’t need many clean clothes if we just sleep without anything on.”
>She grabs you around the chest and tugs at your shirt, snickering
>Sleeping together in the safety of your apartment is one thing, but there’s something a little discomforting about being even deeper in anthro territory where there are a lot more judgmental eyes on you
>And having Chee in the next room over is a lot less stressful than potentially one of Rox’s parents
>What you’re even going to do for lodging over the weekend, neither of you have decided on yet
>Apparently, Rox’s parents know she’s introducing them to “the human”, and nothing else
>”We’ll figure something out,” Rox says, though with a tone of uncertainty. “My dad doesn’t live in the city, so we’re only going to be meeting up with him for a little while. Said he’d be treating us to some food.”
>And her mother?
>Rox winces
>”Yeah, she has a place we could maybe stay. We’ll see...how things go.”
>It’s a bit of a restless night, but at least Mama Chee has breakfast going for the two of you by the time you wake up
>You hope Rox’s mother is even half as much of a loving caretaker as the bird is
>”Call me if anything bad happens,” Chee says in her doting way. “I’ll have my phone with me at all times.”
>”Aren’t you not supposed to have your phone with you while you’re working, Ms. Senior Supervisor of Park Operations?” the wolfess says facetiously
>You can tell the moral dilemma really bothers Chee
>”Oohhh, but I’d worry so much about you guys!” she whines
>”Relax, Chee. I’m sure Sher’s old man isn’t going to ever be too far off in case we get into trouble.”
>Chee is nearly running late for work by the time Rox finally convinces her everything will be all right
>You and the wolfess don’t have much time to enjoy the silence, however, as you’re scheduled to meet with Shearod-K at the Cast Complex station pretty early in the morning
>”Well, you ready?” Rox says as she grabs the luggage
>Getting introduced to a society of anthros when you were flung into it unexpectedly back then suddenly seems much more desirable
>You didn’t have time to worry about the future when you didn’t know what the hell was even happening in the present
>This is supposed to be a fun outing — sort of — but it also feels like you’re going to a court sentence
>You load up your belongings into Rox’s car and soon you’re off to the Cast Complex
>It feels like ages ago that you were skirting past the monorail station, actually somewhat relieved Rox and Chee were shielding you from plunging into a much bigger world than what you had already stumbled upon
>Now, it’s your destination; like a place your anthro parents told you you’d get to see when you got older
>”Gee, do you think we’re going to have a hard time finding the guy?” Rox says, her voice thick with sarcasm
>Standing near one of the ticket turnstiles of the station is the suited elder tiger
>Even among some of the larger species of anthros you’ve seen, the guy is still an impressively intimidating size
>Shearod-K is holding a briefcase in one paw and a sign in the other, like the type you’d see for pickups at the airport
>[ROKSA & ANON]
>Does he not remember you two, or is this his idea of a cute joke?
>At any rate, there definitely wasn’t enough humor left in his genes to pass down to his daughter
>The station isn’t particularly busy, which makes his act of singling you two out all the more confusing
>The tiger doesn’t animate at all until you and Rox are within reach of him
>Then his paw immediately thrusts forward to nearly break your fingers in a mighty handshake
>”Anon. Roksa,” he rumbles. “I trust that Ms. Sherry-K had adequately informed you both that I would be the one meeting you today?”
>”Are you usually so all-business?” Rox says bluntly
>Shearod-K delicately taps his necktie
>A very subtle Whimsey logo is printed on it, easy to miss if he hadn’t pointed it out
>”Not at all,” he replies. “For example, I chose this particular tie to demonstrate my youthful, ‘happening’ side. I apologize in advance if I appear too casually dressed for the occasion. My daughter gifted this to me for my birthday, and I felt it was only appropriate to wear for this affair.”
>Now you’re having an even harder time telling if this guy is being serious or just has a very weird sense of humor
>”So, how exactly is this going to work?” Rox says. “You going to be tailing us the whole time?”
>Shearod-K clears his throat and adjusts his tie in a very stereotypically professional way, as though the act of drawing attention to the garment was more than enough to send it into disarray
>”I’ve been instructed at the behest of the Whimsey-Aesop Living Treaties to accompany the two of you during your arrival to and departure from Moreau. In addition, I am to remain available at any possible opportunity, whether it is to assist either of you or step in should any altercations arise. I implore you to consider allowing me to follow you wherever you should go, but I will gladly remove myself from the vicinity should you request privacy.”
>”Good,” Rox says, “because Anon and I were planning on having sex this weekend.”
>Your heart and stomach fight to see which can vacate your body faster
>Goddammit, Rox
>You’re afraid to look at how Shearod-K is going to react, but a morbid curiosity forces you to anyway
>Shockingly, the tiger remains completely stoic for what feels like several agonizing minutes
>Then he blinks once
>And then he gives a single chuckle that’s more like a sharp exhale
>”My daughter warned me you were a notorious joker, Roksa. I was quite the ne’er-do-well myself back in the day. Alas, that was another lifetime. My purpose now is to ensure our descendants will always have a world in which they have the peace and freedom to tell a good joke now and then.”
>Shearod-K gives his tie one final tug before flourishing a paw toward the turnstiles
>”But, I digress. We have a lengthy ride ahead of us, and I would expect the two of you have been eagerly looking forward to this day, correct?”
>”Yeah, sure,” Rox says with a shrug
>Knowing the wolfess, she’s already making it her goal to mess with the tiger as much as possible
>”Splendid. Follow me, please.”
>The tiger inserts several tickets into the turnstiles and the three of you march through the station toward an awaiting monorail car
>You must still be in the process of getting the color back in your face, because when Rox takes a look at your expression she gives you a wicked smile
>”I mean, if you play your cards right...” she whispers



[[ CHAPTER 30: Rox-steady ]]

>Things change the moment you pass through the turnstiles
>There aren’t many anthros in the station presently, and the ones that are here only give you cursory glances at first as they realize you are just “the human” who snuck his way into the park
>You’re betting most anthros know who you are now, so the surprise has worn off for the most part
>But once you pass through the gates, suddenly they see you like a zoo animal that just broke out of its cage
>Many stop and stare with wide eyes and nervous looks
>It’s not unlike how you’d imagine a group of humans would react if something like Shearod-K appeared on the streets
>”Good morning,” the tiger says cordially to anyone within range. “How are you?”
>He tries to diffuse the situation with cheerful greetings, ignoring the shocked looks of the bystanding anthros
>It might be more effective if he weren’t a burly tiger in a suit who just screams “authority figure”
>Some of the anthros might actually be more intimidated by him than they are of you
>And then there’s Rox
>The wolfess is like your personal bodyguard, throwing glares right back at anyone whose eyes linger too long on your group
>She even drifts away from you and Shearod-K as if ready to chase down anthros who don’t mind their own business
>Off to a great start in this new world
>Eventually the three of you reach the station platform where the underground monorail is loading up passengers
>Rox hovers close to you, shielding you from the other anthros
>”Not that I really want to make this a big deal or anything,” she mutters, “but do you think we should have given everyone more of a warning that we were coming? Are they going to start freaking out when they see Anon?”
>Your thoughts exactly
>”I’d wager that most of them already know,” Shearod-K says without missing a beat. “We’ve sent out a newsletter to the people of Moreau informing them Anon would be arriving. To make the situation any more of a spectacle, however, would likely result in more panic and unwanted attention.”
>”Yeah, I guess,” Rox says. “But, still...it would have been nice to have Mr. Whimsey around to meet us or something. Be kind of a distraction, you know?”
>”D. Whimsey Jr. is a very busy man,” Shearod-K says. “I am certain he would have loved to be with us today for the occasion, but this was certainly too short of notice for him to work into his schedule. Regardless, he has familiarized himself with our people for the majority of his life just as his father has. Although Anon’s initial reception might be a tense journey, I’m confident he will be openly accepted in due time.”
>”Pretty confident about that, huh?” Rox says
>Shearod-K nods thoughtfully
>”Perhaps I am overly optimistic,” he says, “but I believe the prevailing attitude within our society is that it’s about time to make further contact with the humans, and not hide ourselves from them any longer. There are many out there eager to meet humans like Anon. Those are the ones we will focus on first.”
>The tiger gives you what he’s probably expecting to be a friendly look, but it comes off as goofy as best and frightening at worst
>”You will be something of a celebrity, no doubt. I would recommend that you enjoy such an honor while you can. There will be many eyes on you from here on out.”
>So what else is new?
>The three of you step into an unoccupied monorail car and take a seat
>There’s nothing about it different than any of the other Whimsey-owned monorails used to get the guests all around the resort grounds
>Then again, the company is such a stickler for cleanliness that any stray fur would probably be snatched up before anyone could find it, and any claw marks would be swiftly fixed
>You might have ridden in a monorail car at one point used for anthros and never known it
>Rox sits as close to you as she can without being literally on top of you, while Shearod-K takes a seat across from the two of you and pops open his briefcase
>He fishes a pair of bifocals out, as well as a brand new book of crosswords and other puzzles
>”I hope you don’t mind me,” he says, holding up the book. “I like to keep my mind occupied on extended trips. By all means, feel free to strike up a conversation if you so choose.”
>The tiger begins scratching away at the pages as you wait for the monorail to depart
>A few other anthros approach your car, but as soon as they see you through the open doors they slink off to another spot
>Not quite celebrity treatment
>Rox grabs your hand and gives it a squeeze
>You can tell just from her expression what she’s probably thinking
>Something along the lines of, “It’s better like this, because at least I have you all to myself now.”
>The way she coincidentally smiles at you makes it seem like she’s reading your thoughts
>And then showing how proud she is that you know her so well
>You’ve had that sort of mental synchronization with Rox ever since you started working with her, but now it runs deeper than ever
>The wolfess keeps her paw around your hand long after the monorail finally pulls out of the station and begins its underground trip out of the park
>Shearod-K is intensively preoccupied with his puzzles, at least until he hits his first real obstacle
>”Hmm...nine letters, ‘Frostbitten yeti’...wish my little girl were here for this....”
>”Slushbutt,” Rox blurts out
>”Ah, so it is,” the tiger grunts. “Thank you, dear.”
>Rox gives you a shameful look
>”Sorry. Must have been channeling Chee there for a second.”
>The bird would be proud
>Nobody says anything more as the monorail makes its journey
>There’s not much to look at for the longest time, as it’s mostly just tunnels and walls outside the windows
>Thanks to Whimsey engineering, it’s a very smooth ride
>So smooth that it eventually lulls you into a light nap, spurred on by some of the morning fatigue you still had from getting up so early

>Your eyes slowly open to find everyone right where you left it
>Sort of
>Shearod-K is still nose-deep in his puzzle book, though he has numerous cups of coffee and snack napkins littered on a tray next to him
>He closes the book with a satisfied clap and sets it aside
>”All completed to 100% accuracy.”
>The tiger sees your stirring form and looks to his snack tray with a touch of guilt in his eyes
>”I apologize. I should have woken the two of you when the refreshments cart came by. However, it was difficult to keep the attendant from gawking.”
>That’s when you notice Rox’s head resting heavily on your shoulder
>Your hand is still in her paw, and when you move a bit she clenches it tightly
>”Jus...f...minuhh,” she mumbles
>”Ms. Roksa, you’ll want to rouse yourself as soon as possible,” Shearod-K says. “We will be arriving at Moreau station shortly.”
>Rox snorts awake fully, her ears twitching against your face while still gripping your hand
>”Yeah, I...alright, I’m up,” she yawns
>The wolfess grabs her phone
>Just the act of touching it appears to put energy back into her
>”Is something the matter?” the tiger says, looking at Rox’s face
>”Just gotta message the folks,” she sighs. “Do we have any kind of schedule we need to follow when we’re here?”
>”Not particularly,” Shearod-K says. “I was strongly encouraged by the missus not to prepare an itinerary for this visit. You will have me for whatever business you need, but otherwise all decisions will be your own.”
>Rox taps away on her phone with her free paw for several minutes
>Buzzes and chimes punctuate the silence as her messages are returned
>She doesn’t seem particularly thrilled with any of the responses
>”Going to have to meet my dad for a late lunch, then my mom later in the afternoon,” Rox says. “Until then, I guess we’re free for whatever.”
>Rox looks out the window in deep thought, though there still isn’t much to look at yet
>”Not too familiar with Moreau,” she says. “My mom moved here after I had already moved out, but we...all three of us...didn’t make trips here that often before that. Haven’t left Whimsey grounds much since I started working, either. Don’t really know what there is to do in town.”
>”Splendid!” Shearod-K says, perhaps a little too excitedly for such a somber moment. “I would be more than happy to escort the two of you around town, if you so desire. Business brings me through the city quite often.”
>The monorail gradually slows down as it approaches the station
>Now you can see a little more of the outside
>Surprisingly, it still doesn’t look all that different than the Whimsey station
>Shearod-K notes your confusion
>”Moreau is one of several communities that continues to maintain strong connections with the Whimsey Corporation,” he says as though reciting a spiel for an attraction. “It is one of the first communities to have an established W.A.L.T. presence. You’ll find that many of the commodities and much of the city layout has been heavily inspired by the same philosophies Darwin Whimsey Senior used for his theme park.”
>Rox scoffs and shakes her head
>”There really isn’t any getting away from it, is there?” she says. “Seems like once you’ve seen Whimsey World, you start to see it everywhere.”
>”It is quite the empire,” Shearod-K says
>He turns to you for confirmation
>”As important as the company is for us, I’m sure you humans feel its presence just as much?”
>That’s putting it mildly
>Whimsey’s influence can be downright terrifying at times
>After all, they’ve been secretly harboring anthropomorphic animal people for years, and you were probably just one slipup away from being ‘terminated’ from your job on more than one occasion
>But when you separate Whimsey’s dream-filled founder from the rest of the multi-billion megacorporation that was spawned from him, it’s a lot easier to focus on the nicer aspects of the company
>So an entire city built with the same customer service and attention to detail as the Whimsey theme park itself sounds like an incredible place to live
>At last the monorail comes to a stop, and Shearod-K is quick to collect all of his belongings and trash
>Nobody would ever guess a giant, two-legged tiger was sitting there
>You and Rox grab your luggage and follow the tiger through the station
>”I have a vehicle parked for us outside,” the big guy says. “You will be able to stow your personal effects inside the trunk in the meantime while we head out into the city for some leisure. Were you able to secure a place for you and Anon to spend the night, Roksa?”
>”Still working on it...” the wolfess says with a grimace
>”Ah, very well. If there is anything I can do to assist, please do not hesitate to ask.”
>There are a lot more anthros on this end of the tracks, which means a lot more wide-eyed staring and gossip
>Not to mention cellphones whipped out to capture footage of the fabled Anon
>”So, how many other humans DO come through here?” Rox says
>”Not too many,” Shearod-K says bluntly. “However, there have been enough humans in my time that I imagine the novelty will wear off in some time. No offense to you, of course, Anon. It is merely that you are far from being the first human to come through the city, and so I’m certain the populace will acclimate themselves to you faster than any human who has come before you.”
>One can only hope
>Your furry and feathered coworkers have warmed up to you a great deal in the time you’ve been in the park, though on the other hand they’re anthros who already live their lives surrounded by humans more closely than these “city folk” do
>The anthros who live in the park know they’re going to be close to humans
>The anthros who live in the cities might be trying to get as far from humans as possible
>Ultimately, you try to reassure yourself that the ones with an actual hatred for you strange, furless creatures aren’t likely to be living so close to the theme park anyway
>With that in mind, you make an effort to enjoy being the mysterious celebrity for a little while
>You smile and wave, which causes every possible reaction from nearby anthros
>Everything from fright and embarrassment, to awe and cheers
>Rox reins you in before you can get too big a head about it
>”I don’t want to see those eyes linger on any piece of fur for too long,” she whispers as she hooks her arm around your shoulder
>You can tell she desperately wants to give you a cautionary, but loving kiss to reinforce her point, but even the wolfess knows now isn’t the best time for unrestrained public displays of affection
>Shearod-K leads the group to an indoor parking garage, and pretty soon you’re at a pristine beast of an SUV
>”Gee, I pictured you as a ‘compact’ sort of guy,” Rox chides
>If there’s any way to get a smirk out of the tiger, it seems to be praising his authority or status
>”Perhaps a driven tour would be ideal to begin with,” he muses, rolling the keys around his finger

>If you knew even less about Moreau than what you currently know, you’d assume you just took a ridiculously long ride to another part of the theme park
>The place still feels as though you’re within boundaries of Whimsey grounds, which gives the city both a cozy and a claustrophobic feeling
>Tunnels, awnings, and the foliage of giant trees all hang over large swaths of the roads and streets
>It’s quite some time before you can get a good look at the unobstructed sky
>”The Whimsey Corporation has been exceedingly careful in preventing commercial airlines from flying over W.A.L.T. communities,” Shearod-K says. “However, to ensure the privacy of these people, natural and artificial camouflage is used as an added measure of protection against surveillance and intrusion.”
>You can’t help but feel a little bad for the anthros
>Not only are they still effectively hiding from humans, but this has probably always been the way their lives have been lived
>Does that make it easier or harder to cope with?
>All in all, Moreau is a very beautiful city
>Gardens all over the place, and not a single building looks as though it needs a new coat of paint
>Shearod-K goes over the statistics and trivia of Moreau while he drives you around
>Thankfully, the tinted windows take the edge off a little bit
>Rox seems like she’s listening half as much as you are yourself
>Her eyes dart around from one side of the streets to the other, taking in the sights on her own terms
>You put your hand on her lap for comfort, and she turns to you with a warm smile
>When she’s completely certain that Shearod-K is obliviously lost in his monologue, the wolfess sneaks a quick kiss on your cheek
>”To tide you over,” she mouths, winking
>Without even knowing it, that was something you sorely needed
>Whether on the clock or off it, you never had to go for very long without getting some sort of affection from Rox
>Now you’re almost pining for the times when Sherry-K threatening you with a reprimand for “workplace dating” was the worst that could happen
>Why couldn’t you have just stayed awake on that monorail ride so that you could spend every moment lucid and aware of the wolf girl by your side?
>Wherever you decide to crash for the night, you really hope you can get some alone time with Rox
>”Hey,” the wolfess says
>You and Shearod-K both respond in unison
>Sounds like she was talking to the tiger, though
>”Didn’t think to stop and pick something up for the folks beforehand,” Rox says. “Like, you know, gifts or whatever.”
>Her ears droop a bit
>”I...eh heh...kind of missed a few holidays here and there. Might make it easier to break the news to them that Anon and I are...roommates.”
>She taps on the glass and points out to the streets of Moreau
>”Any good places we can do some shopping before I have to meet my old man?”
>”Absolutely,” the tiger responds
>He immediately changes his trajectory, and soon you’re heading to Moreau’s downtown area
>”Lovely shops all over the central plaza,” he continues. “I believe many of them are partnered with Whimsey as well, so you both may be able to benefit from employee discounts.”
>”Yeah, great,” Rox says sarcastically
>Knowing Rox, she’s not happy to be so continuously shackled to Whimsey’s perks and offerings, but she also doesn’t have the kind of spare money to be frivolously wasting away anymore
>She’s definitely been a little more frugal ever since the triple dinner date
>The SUV rolls into a parking lot near the end of a strip mall
>Stores round the circumference of a large pond, where the sun shines spectacularly on the surface through a clearing in the treetops
>Anthro species of all sorts are milling about outside
>It might be in poor taste to think, but you feel as though you’re on safari with the natural wildlife so close outside of the safety of the vehicle
>It’s enough to make you jump a bit when the engine shuts off and the doors unlock with loud clicks
>”Well then!” Shearod-K booms. “Are you both ready to introduce yourselves to some of Moreau’s finest citizens?”
>”Eh,” Rox says in her typical joking way
>She can’t completely hide the anxiety in her voice, though
>Neither can you



[[ CHAPTER 31: Can You Smell what the Rox Is Cooking? ]]

>You step out of the safety of the SUV, and within seconds you have a growing number of eyes on you
>Like before, some of the anthros look on with excitement and confusion while others scurry off to the nearest building to hide in
>”Don’t worry,” Shearod-K says. “Many of them act the same when the Whimseys are in town. They can be a very skittish crowd, for certain.”
>The ones brave enough to approach you — and brave enough to get close to the burly tiger and threatening wolfess nearby — seem to mistake you for someone in the Whimsey family
>”Well I’ll be tanned,” an elderly bear says, sizing you up. “Which one of them are YOU?”
>”This is Anon,” Shearod-K quickly chimes in. “He’s the human who managed to, ah, ‘infiltrate’ Whimsey Park and become one of our own.”
>You catch Rox looking rather amused about the conversation
>She’s directly responsible for your “awakening”, and yet it seems like she’s getting away scot-free from all the involvement
>Either Shearod-K is trying to take the blame off of her, or he really wasn’t briefed as thoroughly about the whole thing as he’d like others to believe
>But the story that you somehow snuck into the park and found out about the anthro side becomes the version the tiger continues to tell to everyone
>And he tells it to EVERYONE
>Every few steps he has to introduce you to another curious bystander, and sometimes you don’t get to move at all before another one or three run up
>Obviously not everyone in Moreau is thrilled to meet you, but the reassuring part is that you only interact with the ones who are
>”Nice to meet you, Anon!”
>”I heard all about you on the news!”
>”Boy, you’re lucky you didn’t end up on someone’s plate after that stunt, hahaha!”
>”Mr. K, you adoptin’ this human or somethin’?”
>”Look at that, the guy’s already stealing our women!”
>Suddenly Rox doesn’t look so amused anymore
>You can’t really blame her though
>Everyone’s laughing and making similar jokes about you and wolfess being a couple, but you have a feeling that the second either one of you admits to it being true there’s going to be an angry mob of anthros ready to run you out of town
>Best to just roll with the punches for now and keep quiet
>Sadly, not everyone is as cordial about your arrival
>You’re so absorbed with the eager anthros crowding around you that you can’t quite make out what one of them yells out from a ways away
>Whatever it is they say, however, you can recognize the anger in their voice and the disgusted way some of the others react to it
>You look out in the distance and see a young opossum cupping his snout, ready to yell something out again
>He has a gang of other anthro youths behind him, egging him on and adding their own insults
>But their jeers and heckling melt away in an instant when Shearod-K throws them a vicious look
>Followed by them breaking their formation and scattering off when Rox begins to charge at them
>”ROKSA!” the tiger roars after her
>Everyone cowers at his voice
>Rox’s ears fold down so quickly and so flatly you think the tiger’s boom might have actually blown them off her head
>She gives Shearod-K a pained look and shamefully returns to your side
>The tiger straightens his tie and leans in close to her, whispering a warning to the wolfess with an extended claw
>”I do not wish to have to remind you of the fragility of your current position. You are representing the Whimsey Corporation with your every action, and instigating violence against ANY individual — no matter the justification — will have dire consequences. Do I make myself understood?”
>”Yes, sir,” Rox mumbles
>That one made YOU break out into a sweat
>Half of the other anthros even took off from the outburst
>Now you know who Sherry-K gets her no-bullshit side from, and you wonder how much she’s been holding back this whole time
>Shearod-K gives a sharp exhale, then tries to give a consoling smile
>”Please, Roksa, keep a level head for the sake of our future. The Whimsey-Aesop Living Treaties is more than prepared to act in the defense of Anon should there be any distasteful prejudices against him. It is part of my job to ensure the hateful actions of others will not impede upon what we hope to achieve together.”
>His brow furrows, and there’s an almost feral look in the tiger’s eyes
>”You have my assurance that W.A.L.T. will not tolerate the aggressions of our community against Anon. I personally will pursue any...disciplinary action we will have to leverage against those who seek to do him or any of us harm.”
>Yikes
>It sounds like he’s trying to assure you of your safety here in Moreau, but in reality it just makes you sweat even more
>When your worst dreams of mysteriously “disappearing” from the company because of what Rox dragged you into first flooded your mind long ago, you imagined someone like Shearod-K being the shadowy figure to drag you off and erase you from the face of the planet
>Whimsey gets what Whimsey wants, and if the company or its affiliates want a world where anthros and humans get along, they’re going to have it
>One way or another
>Again, Whimsey’s influence can be pretty terrifying
>But par for the course, the cheerful façade returns in an instant
>”Now then,” the tiger says with a clap of his paws, “shall we take a walk around the plaza? I believe you said you wanted to purchase some gifts for your parents, did you not?”
>”Y-yeah, totally,” Rox says
>Shearod-K clears a path for the three of you to walk through, using the sheer aura of his lingering ferocity
>You and Rox hang back a little bit
>”Woof,” Rox mutters in your ear. “All the time I’ve spent in Sher’s office COMBINED doesn’t stack up to how much of my life the guy just took off there.”
>She does look a little shaken up, but your comforting look is all she needs to rebound
>Her paw digits flex, wanting to have your hands locked in them
>It’s still not safe to get too touchy-feely with each other out in the open, so the wolfess settles for being shoulder-to-shoulder with you as you walk
>Gently bumping you with her hip every so often

>Much like all the backstage anthro stuff in Whimsey World, you quickly realize just how much these animal folk live like humans
>The shops and businesses aren’t too different, and a lot of the name brands you’re familiar with are just as prevalent as anywhere else
>It’s a little disappointing not to see anthro companies with witty animal puns everywhere like in the movies
>When you point this out to Shearod-K, he has an answer ready just like everything else
>”Our communities have unique, regional brands as well, yes. However, it is often easier to get a much larger, widespread company to establish a separate marketing division for our specific needs. You will certainly find some recognizable franchises in cities such as Moreau.”
>And these big company franchises know they have divisions for anthros?
>”Not always,” Shearod-K says, though he doesn’t follow his words up right away
>Rox jumps in with some input of her own
>”It’s like bootleg stuff,” she smirks. “You’re getting the goods in the end, but it just might not be directly from the people making it.”
>”That might be an oversimplification,” Shearod-K says
>You can tell he’s a little offended by Rox’s explanation
>”What we produce is every bit as legitimate as the humans,” he continues. “In fact, I’m certain Anon would be interested to learn that we have been responsible for many ideas and inventions the humans benefit from to this day. The thermos, the rechargeable battery, many modern incarnations of the toothbrush...and of course, there was that marsupial entrepreneur responsible for the ‘fanny pack’.”
>Rox chokes back a laugh
>”Yeah, a real historical achievement,” she says. “At least it gives us something to laugh at when we see all the guests in the park with those dumb things on”
>”I find it to be a rather convenient utility...” Shearod-K says
>You can almost visualize the picture you saw of the young Sherry-K in the theme park with her parents, but now with her father wearing the pouch of a clueless tourist around his waist
>That’s a good mental image to hang on to whenever you start to get intimidated by him again
>And if you ever have to get a gift for the big guy, at least you have something in mind
>Rox’s own hunt for gifts takes her through most of the stores around the pond
>She looks completely stumped, and you can sense the frustration building in her
>It’s the frustration of someone who has to get a last-minute gift for a person who they have no idea what they’re interested in
>A little bit of guilt is mixed in there as well
>”What do you think?” Rox asks you countless times, holding up everything from shirts to kitchen appliances
>All you can do is shrug
>You’re not going to be much help to her with this
>It’s hard enough to find gifts for other humans sometimes, but a family of wolves?
>Like Shearod-K explained, a lot of stuff sold in these stores is similar to what you’d find in human cities, but once you eyes linger on something for a while you notice the subtle differences
>Pants with extra loops for tails, electronics ergonomically made for paws or talons...
>Finding a gift for the right species is probably a struggle even for anthros
>Rox is also growing impatient with how many anthros sneak up to meet you as you shop
>A group of them even follow you around from stop to stop
>The wolfess looks ready to chase them off, but thankfully she restrains herself
>It’s not Shearod-K’s warning that’s holding her back; it’s you
>”I’m going to have to learn to share you with the world, I guess,” Rox says with a weak smile. “And you’re going to have to do the same when I start performing as ‘me’ out there.”
>You rub Rox on the back out of sight of the other anthros, reminding her what she’s told you many times before
>You’re HER Anon; all hers
>Rox’s muzzle scrunches up in a goofy grin
>”Don’t do this to me right now, buddy,” she chuckles. “It’s not fair. Save all the sentimental stuff for when we can get some alone time together.”
>After roughly two hours of shopping, Rox settles for a bottle of cologne for her father and a gorgeous bouquet of flowers for her mother
>Even for being relatively simple gifts, they’re still specially tailored for scent-sensitive anthros
>Neither the cologne nor the flowers seem to have a noticeable aroma, but Rox insists they’re pretty strong for wolves
>Yeah, you weren’t going to be very useful for this errand
>”I was probably overthinking it anyway,” Rox says. “I mean, ‘it’s the thought that counts’ and all that, right?”
>The wolfess sighs
>”Not much of a daughter, am I?”
>She’s really going to need some ear scratches later on to lift her spirits
>It’s mid afternoon by the time Rox finishes her errands, and you can tell it’s about time to meet her father for a late lunch
>You were subconsciously honing in on any other wolves you saw wandering around the downtown plaza, wondering if you’d run into either of Rox’s parents prematurely
>Of course, once you realized what you were doing you quickly focused your attention elsewhere
>Don’t need Rox thinking you’re checking out another wolfess
>A little outside of the main plaza is a small sandwich shop where you’re scheduled to meet the elder wolf at last
>You drop off the flowers back at the SUV for now, and with a few deep breaths you and Rox are ready to face her father
>”Just gonna apologize in advance if something goes wrong,” Rox murmurs to you. “Remember, if things get ugly we’re walking out.”
>Even Shearod-K seems to be in full bodyguard mode

>It’s nice to see that not everything in Moreau is franchised
>The sandwich shop is a little mom-and-pop establishment run by a family of moles, and it’s a wonderfully cozy place to eat
>A young mole daughter waits to seat guests, and she gives a squeak of surprise when she sees you
>Fortunately, she’s not one of the terribly skittish ones
>Shearod-K is on point with organizing some privacy
>”If you would not mind, miss,” he says to the mole. “These two will be meeting a third diner very shortly, and I would like them to have a table someplace where they would not be bothered. Hopefully you have something available where I could also sit close by.”
>You can tell Rox is a little hesitant to have the tiger be hanging around so close, but she knows if things take a turn for the worse with her father then it’s better to have the only witness be the tiger than the whole restaurant
>”V-very well, sir!” the female mole says. “We have something in the back that might work.”
>The three of you are led to the rear of the restaurant, where a few tables are squeezed around some corners out of sight
>Shearod-K settles at a small table to himself while you and Rox are shown to one at the very end of a narrow hall
>”Hey, Mr. K,” Rox whispers to him before you continue following the mole. “Do you mind not...uh, eavesdropping on us? There’s some personal stuff I need to tell my dad when he gets here.”
>Shearod-K looks surprised by the request, but he doesn’t look too offended by the insinuation
>”Of course, my dear,” he says. “As I said, if there is something you do not need me around for, please feel free to speak up. Would you like me to leave the restaurant for now?”
>”No, no,” Rox quickly cuts in. “This is good. If you can keep people from bugging us, that’d be great. And if something goes wrong at our table...well, I’m sure you’ll hear it pretty easily.”
>”Understood. Enjoy the meal, you two.”
>Shearod-K pops open his suitcase again, taking out a newspaper and one of the oldest cassette players you’ve ever seen
>He daintily sets the headphones over his ears and gives the paper a good flick to unfold it
>All business, all the time
>The mole seats you and Rox next, and the wolfess is quick to put in some drink orders
>”Just something to calm the nerves, you know?” she says to you, rubbing her arm. “I, uh, want you to let me know if I start getting a little too crazy, alright? I mean, about anything. Please?”
>Now that you’re somewhat alone with Rox, you’re free to take her paws in your hands and give her your full emotional support
>Her muzzle darts forward and plants a kiss on your lips
>”Thanks, Anon.”
>You do what you can to calm Rox down, though the way she flinches when the drinks arrive gives away just how nervous she is
>By the time the server turns her back, half of Rox’s glass is already gone
>”Sorry,” she grunts, wiping her mouth with her paw. “I’ll slow down.”
>The two of you sit in silence as minutes drag by
>Eventually, Rox’s ears twitch and swivel
>You can hear Shearod-K’s low rumbling voice give a greeting to someone, followed by another deep voice in response
>”Here goes nothing...” Rox inhales sharply
>The male wolf turns the corner, stopping for a moment when he sees the two of you
>No doubt he was mentally preparing himself for the sight of the human to some degree, though his gaze soon changes over to his daughter
>Rox may actually have the old dog beat in height by a few hairs, though he’s still a bit taller than you are
>He’s definitely a big guy, though he’s not as athletic as Rox and his size comes from a little extra padding of fluff on his body
>His fur is faded and dusted with the gray of old age, but you can find some spots of darkness in the same shade as his daughter
>If you could describe the old wolf in one word, it would probably be “jolly”
>Your tension dissipates slightly, and you pray he’s as friendly as he looks
>Rox stands up from her seat, and you’re right there alongside her
>You meet with the old wolf halfway, though you give the father and daughter some space for a hug
>”It’s good to see you again, sweetheart,” the wolf says warmly as he embraces his daughter
>”Good to see you too, dad,” Rox says back with a sniff
>”Have you gotten taller, Rox?” the wolf says. “It feels like when I saw you last time, you were just a little pebble. Haw-hah!”
>”Pfft, thanks, dad....”
>The two break the hug, and Rox leads her dad closer to you
>”Dad, this is Anon. Anon...?”
>The male wolf looks you from head to toe, and then thrusts a strong paw out to meet your hand
>His eyes don’t have the same golden luster that Rox’s do, but they flash with spirit in a way you recognize all the same
>”Kale”, he woofs. “Glad I could finally see this mysterious human for myself. Didn’t honestly think too much about you showing up in Whimsey World until I heard you were hanging around my Rox. Father’s concern, hmm?”
>His viselike grip isn’t held back by his old age
>”I needed to make sure my little girl was going to be safe. Now that I see you...oh you poor soul! I really hope she hasn’t been beating you up too badly now!”
>The old wolf guffaws and slaps you on the back
>Rox covers her face with her paws in embarrassment
>Just around the corner, you think you can see Shearod-K turning his head in confusion from all the noise
>”Well, now that introductions are out of the way, we can get to all the important talk,” Kale continues. “All of the ‘howl you doings” and whatnot, right? Bwahaha!”
>It’s going to be a pretty interesting lunch
>”Dad, come on...” Rox groans
>Between her paws, you can just make out the hint of a smile on her face



[[ CHAPTER 32: Rox Salt ]]

>The three of you take your seats around the cozy little table
>Just you, Rox, and her father, with the protection of Shearod-K around the corner to give you all some privacy
>You’re still nervous about making a good first impression on the older wolf, but much of the tension has dissipated since shaking his paw
>Kale is very clearly Rox’s father in terms of personality and humor, and from the moment he starts making small talk you can tell he’s going to be a pretty easy guy to get along with
>”How’re things with Chee going? Any more crazy guest stories? Has that tiger girl still been giving you a hard time?”
>You can almost imagine Shearod-K’s ears perk up at the sound of his daughter being discussed, even through his headphones
>Rox is quick to answer her father’s every question, and the more she covers the looser she seems to get
>When the waiter comes to grab more drinks and take orders, she even holds off on the alcohol
>”Get whatever you want, you two,” Kale says as he scans the menu. “Lunch is on me today.”
>”You sure, dad?” Rox replies. “I can treat you for this one. You came all the way out here for me and everything.”
>”That’s treat enough,” the elder wolf says with a smirk. “It’s good to see you again, kiddo. Thanks for the offer, but I know money’s probably still pretty tight for you out here, right?”
>Rox pushes an ice cube around in her glass with her straw
>”Actually...I’ve, uh, gotten a pretty big promotion recently. I don’t want to ruin the surprise yet, though. I think you’ll be pretty impressed, though.”
>Kale’s eyebrows shoot up
>”Atta’ girl! I’m proud of you, sweetheart! Lookin’ forward to what this big surprise is!”
>”Yeah, me too.”
>The wolf father turns his attention to you next
>”So, how about you, Anon? You enjoying yourself workin’ for the Big W, or have you been getting your share of dog days? Bwahah!”
>Rox slaps her forehead with her palm, but you can tell she’s holding back a grin
>You tell Kale about your own experiences with the park, though mostly focusing on everything leading up to “that moment”
>When you get to the recollection of that fateful day, you have to pause
>”So, what happened?” Kale says in a hushed voice. “How did you discover all the little critters running around under the park?”
>”It was me,” Rox quickly blurts out. “I kind of...sort of...pulled Anon backstage that night. I, heh, might not have been thinking straight by the end of my shift. He’s my fault, you could say....”
>Kale nods solemnly, like a father listening to a child’s admitted guilt would
>”I see...well, what’s done is done, I suppose. I hope whatever lesson you learned stuck with you, but it sounds like you still have your job. And a promotion, to boot! So, it looks like it all came out in the wash, eh?”
>Rox chuckles meekly, spinning the ice cube around the glass even faster
>”You were always a bit of a wild child,” Kale continues, “but never a BAD one. I might be a little biased, but I couldn’t have asked to raise a better daughter. As long as you try to be careful — and stay honest to yourself — then I know you’ll make the best choices for your life. You got my support in whatever you do, kiddo.”
>”T-thanks, dad,” Rox says again, her muzzle sinking a bit
>The table becomes much quieter as you wait for your meals
>Rox is obviously waiting for the waiter to come and go so there won’t be any interruption for what she’s about to say
>Her father definitely knows her well, as he lets his plate sit untouched until the waiter is out of sight and Rox is ready to speak up
>”H-hey, dad....”
>”Yes, Rox?”
>You take a breath in sync with the wolfess
>”There’s something I’ve been holding on to...that I probably should have told you a long time ago. Please, don’t get mad, alright?”
>Kale folds his arms, but his expression is still a soft one
>”I suspected there was something bugging you,” he says. “After all I just told you, though, you should know by now that I couldn’t stay mad at you forever, kiddo. Whatever you have to say, I promise I’ll listen to the whole thing.”
>Rox gulps audibly
>Here it comes...
>”There’s a reason why I dragged Anon backstage that night...and why I haven’t been talking to you or mom much about him. I was just...pretty scared of what you’d think; of what EVERYONE was going to think.”
>Kale remains focused on his daughter as Rox lifts her head to look him directly in the eyes
>”Dad...Anon and I have been...together for a while now. Like, closely...together.”
>The elder wolf blinks once, but doesn’t say anything
>Rox takes another breath and continues her confession
>”I met Anon shortly after he started working in the park. It wasn’t just a recent thing like I’ve told you; he’s actually been living with Chee and me for a while. I wanted to meet him...I wanted to see more of him. So, that’s what led to...all of this. Dad....”
>Without a moment of hesitation, Rox takes your hand in her paw
>”Anon and I are in love.”
>Rox’s grip is stronger than the old wolf’s handshake
>Kale blinks again, then looks to you
>All you can do is nod and reaffirm what the wolfess said
>He then looks back to his daughter; now it’s his turn to take a long breath
>”So...is that all?”
>Neither you nor Rox knows what to make of his question, but he’s quick to follow it up
>”Not sure what I was expecting,” he says with a whistle, “but it was probably something much worse. But this? Ahh...I should have seen it coming.”
>The wolf’s chest quakes with a deep chuckle, and his lips curl back into a warm smile
>”I remember how much you loved those old Whimsey cartoons with the humans in them. ‘Heir of Dog’, wasn’t it? Then you wanted to dress up as one for Halloween that year. You tried to tape your ears down and everything! Took us ages to get it all off without ripping all your fur out!”
>Rox’s ears fold back in embarrassment and she covers her head with her free paw
>”D-dad, please....”
>”Yeah, just like that! Bwahahahah!”
>The old wolf slaps the table in amusement as you rub Rox’s back in support
>A few meek laughs escape her own muzzle and her body shakes slightly with the relief of getting that dreaded burden off her chest
>Once Kale comes down from his raucous laughter, his face changes back to a more serious one
>”So...” he grunts. “Had that locked up for quite a while, then?”
>Rox nods, still a little shaken
>Her father takes her other paw and clasps it in his own
>”That hurts me more than anything you could have said, I think,” he says. “To know that my little girl had so much worry she was struggling with for so long. I know we haven’t been the tightest-knit family out there but...I hope you understand that I’ve always wanted you to be happy.”
>Rox sniffles, though with both of her paws occupied she has to bury her snout in her shoulder to wipe her nose
>”Then...you’re not disappointed in me?” she says. “Or Anon?”
>”How can I be?” Kale says. “It looks like the two of you have figured things out better than your old man has. When your mother and I separated, I thought maybe we had scared you away from the idea of ever having a family. We were a little worried when you never had a boyfriend.”
>His words remind you of the night you had with Rox up in Whimsey Castle; she had said something very similar at the time
>When two wolves can’t stay together, the thought of ever having a human for a mate would seem like an impossibility
>Kale’s gaze is on you again, with a soul-piercing inquisitiveness
>”Not too many wolves I know of out there mixing with humans. That’s...probably going to be tough for you. But, if you show my Rox all the love and respect she could ever ask for — if you stay loyal to her and protect her when she needs it — then you have my blessing. Like I said, all I can hope for is to see her happy. The way she smiles now and talks about her job like she’s actually proud of it...I’d like to believe you’re the reason for this change I see in her. And if that’s the case, then you’re part of the family as far as I’m concerned.”
>Rox is joyfully speechless, so it’s up to you to thank the father wolf enough for the both of you
>Strange to imagine someday you’re going to have an anthropomorphic lupine as a father-in-law
>Kale claps his paws together and rubs them vigorously, staring down at his plate
>”Well, the food’s gonna get cold,” he chortles. “Dig in, everyone!”

>Lunch stretches on for at least an hour, thanks to the renewed discussions about Whimsey World and your adventures with Rox
>With Rox’s conscience cleared, she opens up even more about all the good times and bad you’ve shared
>She still doesn’t go into TOO much detail when it comes to the intimate parts, fortunately
>However, you get the feeling Rox would easily brag about having you as a boyfriend and leave nothing to the imagination if you were all gathered in a much less public space
>The two wolves share so much so openly with each other it’s a mystery why Rox wouldn’t try to keep in contact with her father more often
>Then again, you know first hand what kind of baggage she’s been carrying for so much of her life, and you can picture a younger Rox being much more of a rebellious firebrand than she is now
>The kind of young wolfess who wanted to run away and work at a theme park, thinking it would bring back that sense of wonder and magic she had almost given up on
>Now that she’s matured a bit — and you’ve seen her growth yourself — it looks like she managed to find what she was looking for
>Maybe this will be the point where she wants to bring her family back into her life once again
>Well, there’s the other half to the equation you still need to work through...
>”Have you told your mother yet?” Kale murmurs to Rox as the lunch winds down
>”No,” Rox says with a wince. “She’s next. We’ll be stopping by to see her in a little while.”
>”Ah, I see...well...I’m sure if you carefully ease her into the idea, she’ll be just as accepting of Anon as I am.”
>Rox and her father certainly are cut from the same cloth, right down to being unable to tell a convincing lie
>After the waiter collects the check, the three of you get up and head to the front of the restaurant, passing a rather relaxed Shearod-K
>The tiger has accumulated numerous empty cups of coffee, cleaned dessert plates, and an impressive stack of cassette tapes he’s already fully listened to since you arrived, all arranged neatly on his table
>Whether he was in some sort of meditative trance or just got tired of waiting, not even the copious amounts of caffeine he drank is stopping him from looking half asleep
>He jolts awake as the three of you pass by
>”We’ll be outside,” Rox mouths to the tiger as he scrambles to organize himself
>It’s getting late in the afternoon by now, and the crowds are slowly starting to thin out a bit
>Though there are just as many anthros preparing for a night of entertainment as there are anthros ready to turn in for the day
>You could probably settle down right now for some rest with Rox, but there’s still one more person you have to meet first
>The two wolves embrace for another hug as you wait outside for Shearod-K
>”Just remember, kiddo,” Kale says to Rox, “you got my blessing. I know that might not change however your mother feels, but you and Anon are always welcome if you ever find yourselves in my neck of the woods. And keep me posted about that surprise of yours, eh? I want to see what my little girl is going to be doing that’s got her so excited!”
>”Thanks dad,” Rox says. “I will. It was good to see you again.”
>After they break, Kale sticks his paw out for you
>When you grab it, he yanks you into a crushing hug of your own
>Even for a wolf, he has a very “dad” sort of smell about him
>Are you actually starting to pick up on anthro scents yourself?
>Or maybe it’s just that cologne Rox says he loves...
>Either way, you can definitely tell the difference between his fur and Rox’s, and it just makes you want to bury your face in the coat of your wolfess that much more
>”Was nice meeting you, Anon!” he says with another powerful slap on the back. “You’re part of the family now, alright?”
>His muzzle hovers close to your ear, and you catch a barely audible rumble from his throat
>”Keep her happy, please. I never want to stop seeing her like this.”
>”Dad, you’re making this awkward,” Rox groans as the hug drags on
>”Oh, sorry!” Kale snorts. “Wouldn’t be a proper father if I didn’t try to make you run away in terror, would I? Have a good night, you two! Bwahahah!”
>The old wolf’s laughter continues through his waves goodbye and all the way until he’s out of sight
>Shearod-K comes strolling out of the restaurant, briefcase in one paw and straightening his tie with the other
>”Well then,” he says, cleaning his throat. “I trust you did not need me to intervene after all?”
>”Nah, it was a good lunch,” Rox says
>Her eyes are still fixed on the last place she saw her father, and there’s a content grin on her lips
>”Splendid. Now, I believe you have one more meeting for the night?”
>The smile on the wolfess vanishes just like that
>”Yeah, my mom. She should have an extra room for Anon and me to stay tonight. Hopefully....”
>Shearod-K nods firmly
>”Then I will drop the two of you off as soon as you are ready. In the morning I will return to collect you.”
>Rox looks like she wants to say more, but she just ends up chewing on her gums

>The suburbs of Moreau are even more wooded than downtown, understandably
>There are small houses, large ones, and some built into hills or even the ground
>Guess there’s only so much of the animal instinct you can take out of an anthro
>Rox sits up front so she can point Shearod-K in the right direction, but whenever she’s not actively guiding him she’s looking at you through the rear-view mirror
>Preemptively asking for forgiveness, or maybe waiting to see if you’re going to bail out
>”Is this the place?” the tiger says
>He pulls up alongside a beautifully maintained ranch home, part of which looks as though it’s built into rocks and a small cave
>A wolf’s “den”, no doubt
>The tiger helps you and Rox unload his SUV, but right as he’s about to return to the wheel the wolfess stops him
>”Hey, Mr. K,” she says. “You’re not going to be too...far away, are you?”
>The feline cocks an eyebrow
>”I was planning on returning to the city square,” he says. “There is a hotel I am quite fond of with a wonderful continental breakfast. Is there something you would need my assistance for out here? It seems like a safe, respectable neighborhood.”
>”I, uh, would just feel better if you were close by for this,” Rox says, scratching her neck. “For a little while, at least. I could send you a message or something if we get everything under control.”
>”As you wish,” the tiger says with a bow of the head. “I will be in close proximity. You may contact me as needed.”
>”Thanks, big guy.”
>Shearod-K takes a slow drive around the neighborhood, leaving you and Rox alone to face the mother wolfess inside the house
>Rox takes your hand and the two of you slowly walk up to the front door
>You can practically feel the pulse in the wolfess’ paw
>”Here it goes....”
>She rings the doorbell, then gradually leans back farther and farther
>”If she doesn’t answer in the next thirty...uh, ten seconds—“
>*click*
>Too late
>When the door opens, your jaw unhinges and your mouth opens up
>It’s like looking at a second Rox; a bit older, but wearing her age gracefully
>And if Rox wore sundresses and jewelry rather than t-shirts and jeans
>There’s really not much else to say except that THIS is where your wolfess clearly got her good looks from
>”Welcome home, Roksa!” the mother wolf says with a voice that has Rox’s tone but far too much honey than the daughter could ever muster
>”Hi, mom,” Rox says in return, starting the next wave of hugs
>But as the mother’s head leans over her daughter’s shoulder, the older wolfess’ eyes go wide at the sight of you
>Rox must feel the change in the atmosphere, because she quickly pulls away and backs up to join you
>”Mom, this is my coworker, Anon. Anon, this is Lelea.”
>You don’t move until Rox nudges you forward, and Lelea doesn’t move even after you hesitantly extend your hand
>Rox makes a noise that sounds like a mix between a grunt and a huff, and her mother thrusts her paw out to take your hand
>Your skin hardly has time to register the incredible softness of her paw pads and the fur between them before your hand is lightly clasped, shaken once...twice...and then promptly released
>You pretend like you don’t notice the subtle wipe the older wolfess does on her sundress
>”Anon, it is...a pleasure to meet you,” Lelea says. “Would the two of you like to come in?”
>”Yeah, that’d be great, Rox mumbles
>The way she pushes you ahead of her makes it feel like you’re being taken hostage, even though you’re certain Rox wants to be in this situation even less than you do
>The inside of the house is remarkably well kept, and all the sights and sounds and smells evoke nostalgic, cozy feelings within you
>It’s a mother’s home, for sure, though there’s also a certain somberness to it
>You can quickly find numerous pictures of Rox throughout her years on mantles and shelves, but nothing to indicate Lelea was ever married
>Or currently in a relationship, for that matter
>”Sooo, mom...” Rox says. “Are you still alright with Anon and me spending the night here?”
>”Of course I’m alright with letting you stay in your own home, Roksa,” the mother responds
>The way she says it makes it sound like she was deliberately only answering part of the question
>”The spare bedroom — well, YOUR bedroom — is all prepared and ready for you. And...we always have the sofa bed available for guests like Anon.”
>”Anon should be fine with me,” Rox says. “There’s plenty of room in my old bedroom, right?”
>Lelea blinks, looking from you to Rox rapidly
>”W...do you mean on the floor? Well, I suppose....”
>”I’m sure we’ll work something out,” Rox says coolly
>The younger wolfess leads you to her former bedroom, with her mother giving a quick gesture to the sofa as though trying to sell its comfort to you
>The spare bedroom, though charming in of itself, has none of the “Rox charm” you’ve grown to love
>You wouldn’t even guess it used to be hers if it weren’t for the photos of the young wolfess spread throughout
>Rox must have taken even possession of hers to Whimsey when she moved out, which isn’t all that much
>”Can I get you something to eat, Roksa?” the mother says
>”We ate not too long ago,” Rox replies, with a heavy emphasis on the “we”
>”I see,” Lelea says. “Well, I do have some snacks available if you’re hungry. Maybe we could relax in the living room and catch up?”
>”Yeah, sure,” Rox responds. “I think a talk would be good.”

>The first time Rox’s mother addresses you without prompt is when you sit down on the living room sofa
>”Comfortable, isn’t it?” she says. “If you would prefer to sleep out here, I would be happy to—“
>”He’ll be fine with me,” Rox says bluntly
>”Of course. Roksa, there another seat over here so the two of you aren’t so cramped on the—“
>”I’ll be fine right here.”
>Off to a great start
>Lelea sips on some tea while Rox goes over her life updates for the second time
>She focuses on the positives of her job more than before, as if really trying to impress her mother, though the way she talks about things doesn’t have the same kind of pride or joy as when she explained everything to her father
>Her stories have less of the sort enthusiasm you’d expect from a child who brought home a straight-A report card, and more of the boastful kind of “take that” attitude from someone trying to prove to a life’s worth of doubters that she’s managed to reach her goals
>You DO think Lelea is genuinely proud of her daughter, and if the pictures all over the place are any indication she still has a deep amount of love for Rox
>But the tenseness is thick in the room, and it’s far worse than the seconds leading up to meeting Kale
>Doesn’t help that the conversation quickly becomes a tug-o-war of topics, with Rox trying to pull you into the discussion while her mother wants to hear more about her daughter
>Eventually, Lelea gives in and accepts that you’re going to be the one in the spotlight for a little while
>”So, Roksa, how did you and Anon, ah, meet?”
>”I pulled Anon backstage and showed him our part of the park one night. Now he’s living with me and Chee.”
>Gonna rip the bandage right off, huh?
>Lelea’s muzzle scrunches up and she looks as though someone dropped something foul into her tea
>”Wait, he’s...? But I thought you were just showing him around or...I-I don’t know?”
>”Yeah, that’s what I said,” Rox replies firmly. “I showed Anon around the park ‘in depth’, and then I got stuck with him. Or, he got stuck with me, heh. We’ve been roommates for a while now.”
>”Not...in the same room or anything, right?”
>Rox suddenly sits rigid, with a furrowed brow and claws digging into her pants
>”Mom, there’s something you have to know.”
>Oh boy, brace for impact...
>Rox inhales sharply
>”Anon and I are together. We’re dating.”
>It’s not a “spit take” moment, or a “breaking the fine china” moment, but it’s enough for Lelea to not realize she’s gradually spilling her tea on the carpet
>She saves enough of it to justify putting the cup down on the table rather than just dropping it, but the stain goes ignored
>The mother wolf mouths the beginning of about a dozen different sentences, but none of them are audible
>Rox seems to relish in waiting for a response
>Finally, Lelea gets something out
>”You’re, h-haha, that’s one of your jokes, isn’t it? The two of you aren’t actually...?”
>”Yes, mother, we’ve been dating for weeks. Anon and I LOVE each other. We even SLEEP together every night.”
>”ROKSA!” Lelea sputters. Her eyes bulge out. “I don’t believe this! That’s so...how could you joke about this sort of thing?”
>”Why do you think I’m joking?” Rox snarls. “Because he’s human? Because he’s not a wolf? That’s what you always wanted, isn’t it? For me to date some wolf boy?”
>”W—Yes, but....”
>Lelea’s eyes manage to get even wider when she realizes the can of worms she just opened up
>Rox shakes her head with a venomous glare
>”I thought I could open up to you about this. Dad was fine with it, why can’t YOU be?”
>”This has nothing to do with your father and me,” Lelea snaps. “This is about YOU, Roksa. You’ve said yourself things are getting better for you, so why don’t you wait for a nice wolf rather than degrading yourself—“
>”ENOUGH!”
>Rox’s voice shakes the room, and the wolfess leaps to her feet with a speed that sends both you and the mother wolf recoiling
>Rox storms off to the spare bedroom, leaving the two of you in silence until she lumbers back with all of your luggage in her arms
>”W-what are you...?” the mother says
>”I was going to give each of you just ONE chance to accept Anon,” Rox hisses. “I’ve made a life for myself with Anon and WITHOUT either you or dad, but I wanted to let you both back into it. Once chance, and you blew it. You’ve been nothing but horrible to Anon since we got here, so we’re leaving. Maybe I’ll call again in a few more years, but if you don’t think you’re ever going to change then just save me the trouble right now!”
>Rox storms to the door, beckoning you to follow
>”Roksa, wait!”
>”DON’T EVER CALL ME THAT AGAIN!” the young wolfess roars. “My name is ROX! I’ve told you that for YEARS! I tell everyone to call me Rox, and everyone else fucking listens! There’s only ONE girl out there I let call me ‘Roksa’, and I respect her a hell of a lot more than I do YOU right now!”
>You have to duck under Rox’s swinging, bag-filled arms to avoid being clobbered out the door
>Right on cue, the monstrous SUV of Shearod-K pulls up along the side of the road
>You’re right at Rox’s heels as the two of you make your way to the vehicle
>Just then, you hear Rox’s mother at the front door
>”Rok—honey, stop! Listen to m—!”
>But her words taper off into muteness as the burly tiger paces around his car to stand between you and the house
>You don’t look back, and the way Shearod-K glares at the older wolfess behind you makes you glad you don’t
>It’s enough to scare her back into the house with a slam of the door
>Rox throws all the luggage into the car before Shearod-K can even offer his help, so he squeezes himself into the driver’s side and waits for everyone to buckle up
>”Forgive my foolishness for assuming you will not be spending the night at this residence?” the tiger says. “Is there someplace else you know of that you would rather stay? It is getting fairly late.”
>”I don’t care, just drive,” Rox mumbles into her fist
>Her throat sounds hoarse and she’s biting into her paw hard enough to draw blood through her dark fur
>She’s trying her hardest not to look at anyone else in the car, but even through the reflection of the windows you can see the building, glistening moisture in her golden eyes
>Wherever the tiger is going to take you, you think Rox is probably going to be holding her breath the entire time



[[ CHAPTER 33: Bed Rox ]]

>The ride back to downtown Moreau is a quiet one, though for much different kinds of reasons than before
>It’s hard to say whether you’d trade the tenseness of the trip to Rox’s mother’s house with the heartbreak coming back from it, but in spite of the sadness in the car there’s a feeling of relief
>The storm has passed, even though what’s left over in its wake is still a mess
>You put your hand on Rox’s shoulder and the wolfess’ nostrils flare with a sharp breath
>She won’t look at you
>Knowing Rox, she’s not angry, disappointed, or ashamed of you in any way, though
>She’s much more likely to feel that way about herself, and she doesn’t want you to see her as such a wreck
>All you can do for now is what her father asked: show her love, and be there to protect her
>Looking into the rear-view mirror, you can tell Shearod-K is troubled by his own inability to help Rox
>You thank the tiger for returning so promptly to pick the two of you up
>Rox sniffs in agreement
>”No trouble at all,” Shearod-K says. “I do not wish to pry into personal or familial matters, but I am thankful whatever transpired between you three did not require any serious intervention from my behalf.”
>You’re just as glad
>Shearod-K has an air about him that makes you think he’s always ready to rip open his business suit and bare his teeth if he needs to, and for someone of his size the doomed victim would be lucky to pass out from fright before the tiger has a chance to tear them to shreds
>Family fights are ugly enough when it’s just words; you don’t need to see bloodshed from claws and fangs on top of it
>Speaking of fangs, Rox’s paw is now noticeably bloodied from how intensely she’s biting into it
>It takes some coaxing and a little bit of rubbing her arm, but you manage to get her to release the paw so you can take a better look at it
>Rox continues staring out the window as you examine the damage
>”Is everything all right?” the tiger in the front seat rumbles. “Ms. Rox was not abused, was she?”
>You quickly assure him that nothing happened...physically, anyway
>It’s as though the smell of blood makes his own start to boil
>Shearod-K really wasn’t kidding when he said he wouldn’t let anyone stand in the way of humans and anthros getting along; you’re almost afraid of what he’d do to Rox’s mother if she had actually harmed her daughter
>But the tiger’s temper melts and he draws a fresh handkerchief from one of his pockets
>The cloth feels amazingly silky-smooth, and it’s embroidered with the tiger’s initials on the corner
>”You may wrap her paw in that,” he says to you. “No need to return it to me. I have plenty of others just like it.”
>You thank him again and tend to Rox’s paw
>The wolfess flinches as you wrap her up; she really must have bitten into it deeply
>She tries to feebly take her paw back after you’re finished, but you hang on to her for support
>Her communication consists only of sniffling
>Lights peek through the dense foliage of the Moreau forests as you arrive back at the downtown square
>The reality of a secret town full of anthros seems even more mysterious and magical at night with the anthros’ glowing, watchful eyes piercing through the shadows
>You’ve been used to your coworkers for a while now, but the unfamiliarity of these strangers gives Moreau that sort of mythical quality to it as though you’ve stumbled upon the anthros’ hidden society for the first time all over again
>Throwing in that Whimsey aesthetic and polish doesn’t hurt the sense of wonderment either
>Shearod-K drives to the front of a pretty classy hotel, where a mandrill bellhop is already marching over to the vehicle in preparation to take your luggage
>”Good evening, sir,” the mandrill says with a bow. “And welcome back. Will this all be going to your room?”
>”Just the bags for these two,” the tiger says, motioning to you and Rox. “They will be using the room I already have reserved under my name, while I speak with the concierge to secure a second suite for myself.”
>The mandrill recoils in surprise when he finally notices you, but any opinions about you as a human (one way or the other) are disguised behind his professionalism
>”Very good, sir. If the two of you would please follow me?”
>You give the tiger a confused look, and even Rox lifts her head just enough to look him in the eyes
>He’s letting you use his room just like that? It can’t be that cheap of a place...
>”It has been a long day for the both of you, and I am certain the room is ready by now,” Shearod-K says with a wave of his paw. “Please, go head and use my suite for the night. I will join you for breakfast in the morning.”
>He hands you a keycard and shoos you off to follow the bellhop, not accepting any objections or even waiting for you to thank him again
>The mandrill has all your luggage under control, letting you give full attention to Rox as you walk with her arm around yours
>She’s practically in a trance the whole way, silently hanging her head and looking down at her feet while you guide her through the hotel
>This place is clearly one of the Whimsey-groomed businesses in Moreau, with immaculate cleanliness and stunning decoration from the fountains to the doorknobs
>It’s extremely quiet in the hallways, making Rox’s sniffles even harder to bear
>The mandrill stops you at a suite in the far end of the hotel, unlocking the door for you and depositing your luggage inside
>”Give a ring to the front desk if you need anything,” he says with a bow. “Enjoy your stay.”
>He strolls off with a whistle as you lead Rox into the room

>It’s a shockingly large suite, even for someone like Shearod-K
>Giant entertainment center, a bathtub that’s like a small pool, a fully stocked minibar that’s bigger than some refrigerators...
>But the strangest part is that it’s very clearly just a one-bed suite
>Did the tiger just assume one of you would take the couch, like Rox’s mother did?
>Or is the tiger much more observant about the relationship between you and the wolfess than you thought?
>Rox drifts out of your grip and staggers over to the king-size bed
>With a heavy *WHOOMPF* she throws herself onto the bed, face down in the pillows and lying motionless
>Well, sleep is probably the best thing for her right now
>You grab your bags by the door and move them farther into the suite, unpacking a few necessities before you get ready to turn in for the day yourself
>A horrible noise stops you cold: it’s like the sound of a dying animal
>That’s partially correct, anyway
>A brief inhale is all Rox prepared you with before she begins to bawl into her pillow, finally letting it all out
>All of the anguish she bottled up and suppressed since storming out of her mother’s house is released with wailing howls
>Her chest heaves and her back arches with every ragged breath she takes, shortly before the next series of sobs
>Her toes curl and push into the sheets like she’s trying to shove herself deeper into the pillows
>You can’t take more than a step at a time before you’re stopped by an even louder cry, as though she’s warning you not to get too close to her
>But what’s even worse than hearing your wolfess so stricken with grief is being unable to comfort her, and you’ve had to rein in your own emotions and affection for her ever since this morning
>You’re alone with her now, and nobody’s around to interfere or judge you
>You sit on the bed next to Rox and place your hand on her back
>Expectedly, she shudders at your touch, but it’s also enough to stop her crying for a moment
>You rub up and down her back for a while, then your hand wanders up to her neck
>The thickness and softness of her fur is pure pleasure to run your fingers through, but you don’t linger in one spot for too long
>This is for HER enjoyment, after all, not just yours
>Your other hand joins the first as you lean in to stroke the back of her head and the base of her ears
>Rox’s sobs get shorter and quieter while you begin scratching her, switching between deeply digging into her fur and gently running your fingertips along the edges of her ears
>Every so often one hand will return to her back for a little rub or a light pat, and then it’s back to giving full care to her favorite spots
>No more bawling, no more howling
>The wolfess whines and hiccups, but the worst is over
>Maybe you could have let her cry it out a bit longer, but part of you believes she wants this more than simply stewing in her own misery
>In fact, whenever you pause your scratches for too long her ears swivel around like periscopes searching for your hands
>When you resume the tender care, she lets out a sigh and a peaceful moan
>Rox is done with her sadness, and you’re done with seeing her that way
>Her neck muscles stiffen right before she slowly lifts her head up to look at you at long last
>And, unfortunately, you can’t help but let out a quick laugh
>Rox’s face is completely covered in the aftermath of her crying, from her red eyes to her tear-soaked cheeks...to the snot and saliva stringed on her muzzle
>It’s a pitiful image that is somehow too adorable to not find a little humorous
>”W-what’s so damn f-funny?” Rox snorts
>You fetch some tissues for her, along with a few damp washcloths
>Once she gets a chance to blow her nose you move in to help clean her fur up
>She sits up and lets you cup her chin while you blot her snout and dry her eyes, ending with a few kisses on top of her muzzle
>Next comes her paw, which has thankfully stopped the bleeding but still soaked through the handkerchief with a fair amount of blood
>Good thing Mr. K isn’t expecting this back
>She flinches some more and inhales as you clean the bite marks, but once you wrap fresh bandages over her paw it’s as though you’ve already taken all the pain away from the wound
>Her digits wiggle and curl around your fingers, and you give the paw pads each a kiss of their own
>You look into Rox’s eyes, and in spite of the sorrow in them you can easily find the beauty as well
>The redness mixed with her natural gold makes you think of leaves changing colors in the heart of autumn
>She sniffs some more and you dab her black nose again with a tissue
>”W-well,” she croaks. “One out of t-two isn’t so bad, huh?”
>You pull the wolfess in for a hug, and for a second you think she might break down again
>Yet she stays resilient, and rather than crying some more she chuckles weakly
>You can feel her head move as she looks around the suite
>”H-how did we even get here? H-haha...are we on vacation or s-something?”
>The two of you share the hug for a while, rocking side to side while you continue to comb through her fur with your fingers and scratch the back of her ears
>You only stop when she lets out a long yawn, but you keep holding on to her
>Without letting go of her good paw, you pull back the sheets and delicately slide the wolfess under the covers
>She looks so cozy all tucked in, though the content smiles come out in earnest only when you finally join her in bed
>There isn’t going to be any passionate lovemaking tonight like she joked about, but this works just as well
>You place a hand back on her neck while she puts her good paw on yours
>You and Rox touch foreheads, and you can hear the subtle swishing of her tail against the sheets
>”Thank you, Anon,” she whispers. “I’m...glad we could still find something nice to do on our little vacation. I love you so, so much....”
>No doubt it’s harder for her to breathe with her nose plugged up, but her faint exhales through her open mouth make you picture the wolfess blowing the last of her unhappiness out
>”So...so much....”
>These are probably the softest bed sheets you’ve ever slept in, and they still don’t compare to Rox’s fur
>Your petting is rhythmic, and you don’t even remember stopping by the time you fall asleep to the light snoring of the wolfess next to you

>There are a lot of negative things you can say about the Whimsey Corporation from an employee’s perspective, but there is no denying they know how to treat their guests like kings and queens
>You’re not even on the park grounds, but anything they have a hand in creating has that trademarked magic to it
>Was your mattress doing some crazy, high-tech massaging or conforming to your body while you slept in it?
>Well, there was too much else to focus on last night to notice if the bed had some kind of advanced features to it, but then again that always was a key part of Whimsey service: you never really stop to realize just how discreetly they work their care into every little detail
>What a surprisingly good sleep that was, and the morning is off to a gorgeous start with the sight of the wolfess right before you
>The redness in Rox’s golden eyes is gone when she opens them, and when she finds her human right where she left you her lips stretch into a satisfied smirk
>She taps a spot on the sheets right by her mouth where she must have been drooling all through the night, making a wet sounding noise with each pat
>”Hey, guess we got to make a mess in bed after all, huh?” she says with a snicker
>Rox puts her paw behind your head and tries to move it closer to the saliva puddle
>”Wanna feel? It’s really gross.”
>No...Rox...no
>When she can’t get your head to touch the drool, she instead guides you to her lips for a wonderful good morning kiss
>A little less gross
>”Probably gonna need a shower before we meet up with the big guy,” Rox says. “He said something about breakfast, right? Damn, haven’t eaten anything since our late lunch yesterday....”
>Her ears perk up at the sound of her phone buzzing
>She fishes it out of pocket right as it stops ringing, flipping though all the missed calls and messages
>You can see in her eyes some bitterness at what’s on the screen
>”Maybe later,” Rox says, tapping a quick text that you’re sure says something very similar
>The phone starts buzzing again, but this time she lets out an amused sigh
>”It’s Chee...hey, do you think you could take this one for me? Just tell her...whatever.”
>Taking a call for someone else is made even harder when Rox pulls you into her arms for some morning cuddling
>You answer the phone, and immediately you hear Chee’s confused gasp on the other side
>”Anon!? Is Roxie there? Is she alright? Are YOU alright?”
>Rox chuckles in her throat as you say what you can to console the frantic bird
>”I-I was just worried about the two of you,” Chee says. “I wanted to give you some privacy in case you were still with her parents, but...I couldn’t sleep! How did things go?”
>Rox’s nuzzling on your neck is like encouragement to go on, giving you the “okay” to explain things to your mutual roommate
>So you tell Chee everything in a condensed version: the trip around town, the lunch with Kale, and ultimately the incident with Lelea
>You’re quick to assure Chee that Rox, despite it all, is still with you in one piece
>”Oh, good! I-I mean, it’s not good what happened, but...I’m glad the two of you are safe. I was actually really worried about you too, Anon. It’s such a big world out there, and all your friends are way back here where we can’t protect you!”
>Now it’s your turn to chuckle
>It’s such a weird concept to think that “going home” means returning to your job at a theme park where animal people live right next door
>It took a while for many of the anthros to warm up to you — and some are still not quite there yet — but Rox really was right: this IS your family now
>”How has Sherry-K’s father been? He hasn’t been...too mean or anything, has he?”
>You let Chee know that Shearod-K has been more than a respectable bodyguard, and that he’s the one to thank for preventing the situation with Rox’s mother from being allowed to get too out of control
>”Good, good...I-I mean NOT good that it happened, again. Sorry....”
>Poor Chee
>It’ll be good to see her again
>You let the bird know you and Rox will probably be back home later this evening, and she lets out a whistling sigh
>”I can’t wait! Let me know when you’re on your way! If I can’t make you both a nice dinner tonight, then I at least want to so something special for breakfast tomorrow before you go in for work!”
>”Heh. Thanks, mom,” Rox whispers under her breath
>Not only was it not in her usually sarcastic tone, but there’s a sincerity to the wolfess’ words that make it sound as though she’s being serious
>If your friends at Whimsey World really are your family, then Chee plays double duty as the mother, too
>She’s been more of a mother to Rox than Lelea, and she’s been a pretty commendable substitute for your own ever since moving in with the two girls
>All this talk of breakfast and the tiger makes you realize Shearod-K’s probably been awake for hours at this point, being the punctual businessman and guardian that he is
>You say goodbye to Chee and even get Rox to mumble a quick greeting to the bird as well before hanging up
>You can’t quite stop yourself from seeing the leftover reply from Rox’s mother once you end the call with Chee
>[I understand. Please, know that I truly love you, sweetheart, and that I’m very sorry for what happened. I’ll be waiting whenever you’re ready to talk again.]
>Fortunately, Rox doesn’t notice that you saw the message
>Who knows when she’ll make the attempt to reconnect with her mother, if she ever even will?
>That’s for the wolfess to decide, and even though you want to protect her from anything that could do her harm or bring her sadness, you understand that some battles are hers alone
>For now, however, she seems fine with letting her mother think about her actions for a while longer
>Rox stretches her body out fully, pushing her limbs into you and rolling on top of your body
>”Hhhnnnggghhhaaa...hhh-alright,” she groans, “About that shower. Want to speed things up and share the water?”
>Her paw sneaks along your side and down to your rump, where she gives you a little squeeze
>You gasp as it catches you off guard, and Rox uses the moment of surprise to plant her mouth against your own
>She wipes your lips when the kiss parts
>”Might as well get some use out of the place as long as the big guy’s offering. If this is a vacation, we’re not leaving until we get some more enjoyment out of it, right?”
>You don’t think you’ve let go of Rox once since last night, and that streak continues as she leads you by the hand out of bed and all the way to the bathroom
>Now, let’s see if she can keep this up even when you’re changing clothes...



[[ CHAPTER 34: Rox Cake ]]

>You haven’t heard from Shearod-K yet, but you assume he’s waiting patiently for you and Rox to join him
>The wolfess, however, is more interested in the hotel room she ended up in than being on time for breakfast
>”It really IS like we’re on vacation,” Rox says with a whistle. “Someday, after I save a little bit of money, we’re coming back here to get a place just like this. We’ll lock ourselves in for a whole weekend and see what kind of trouble we can get into!”
>Curiosity gets the better of her, and she opens a few of the dresser drawers
>Large, immaculately folded suits in multiple colors and packaged up in plastic are neatly organized inside the drawers
>The same goes for a few dozen pairs of socks and even a few ties
>”Damn, is all this stuff really his?” Rox says. “Does he own this room or something?”
>It certainly seems that way
>The cabinets are filled with bags of imported coffee blends, cases of pens, and stacks of untouched notepads and puzzle books
>Everything that a business tiger would need to get through the day, yet despite the room being utterly devoid of any dust it doesn’t look as though any of these supplies ever go used
>Shearod-K takes the “better safe than sorry” mentality to a whole different level
>Once Rox is done snooping around she grabs a towel and lassos you into it
>She drags you into the bathroom, where the two of you proceed to strip down before stepping into the shower
>You’ve gotten quite used to bathing with her, though she doesn’t shower nearly as much as you need to
>The shower itself it larger than your whole bathroom back at the apartment, with spouts and jets at all kinds of heights and angles
>There’s even a full-body hair dryer for anthros
>You can tell Rox really wants to take her time and get a deep, intimate cleaning in, but responsibility finally wins out in the end
>”Yeaaah, we’re coming back here for sure,” she moans as you help rinse her down
>She hoists one of your arms up into the air, rubbing your side down vigorously
>”Gotta get nice and dirty first, though. The kind of dirty you’re gonna have to really scrub to get out....”
>She pats you on the thigh when she’s finished, letting her paw wander a little too closely to your groin
>”Alright, let’s dry off and go meet up with the big guy.”
>Rox grabs the towel and wipes you down, then rolls it up and starts cracking it at your feet
>She gives the towel a sniff before using it on herself, though she has to step into the full-body dryer for the rest of her cleaning
>The wolfess’ fur billows out as the air blasts her from head to toe
>You try to get dressed, but Rox holds you close while she spins around in the dryer
>”Feel it for me,” she says, guiding your hands along her pelt. “Believe it or not, you can tell if I’m still a little damp better than I can.”
>She snickers in your ear when she says this
>All that built up tension and she never got to blow off some steam like she was hyping up for the weekend
>Now you’re going to have to deal with a handsy, pent up wolfess the whole trip back
>”Maybe we should have toughed it out at my mom’s place,” Rox says bitterly. “Would have loved to have her hear us humping in the next room over, after the big stink she made about us being together.”
>She sighs heavily
>”There’s a LOT of things I wish I could have done or said before we left. I should have been a little more prepared for everything....”
>You go from simply checking her fur for dryness to giving the wolfess some deep scratches to calm her down
>What’s done is done, and there’s no sense in having Rox beat herself up over things that could have been
>”Yeah, you’re right, as always,” she says, nuzzling against your bare skin. “We got a much better place to stay out of it anyway. Sorry you had to see me be such a mess again....”
>You give her a kiss on the muzzle, and she gives you one on the cheek in return
>She has the confession off her chest at last; what happens from here is anyone’s guess, but at least she doesn’t have to keep hiding this from her parents anymore
>It’s a different story for you, but you’re not in any serious rush to be telling your own friends and family about the wolf girl you’re living with
>The two of you finish up in the bathroom and get dressed, packing your luggage back up and giving the room one last inspection
>This WOULD make for a nice little getaway, like for a honeymoon...
>”Let’s move, Anon!” Rox barks. “I’m starving! Didn’t eat a single thing since lunch yesterday.”
>She nips at your ears to keep you moving quickly

>As expected, Shearod-K is sitting at a table in the hotel dining room, already surrounded by numerous cups of coffee and empty plates
>”Sorry for keeping you, Mr. K,” Rox says. “Have you been waiting for a long time?”
>”Not particularly,” the tiger responds. “I knew you both would be quite fatigued after yesterday’s excursions, and so I decided not to make any time-sensitive plans for today. I had my morning exercise in the gym, and I have been enjoying some quiet downtime with a light meal.”
>”Do you wear a suit to the gym as well?” Rox says, her elbow poking you in the sides
>He definitely has the extra clothes to do it...
>But it’s not surprising that such a big anthro like him with such a willingness to be a physical guardian would stay in shape
>”By the way,” Rox continues, rubbing her neck, “thanks for letting us use your room, Mr. K. I know I wasn’t too appreciative last night after...everything.”
>”Say no more,” Shearod-K says. “It was of no inconvenience to me, and I was already prepared to organize lodging for you and Anon if you were not able to secure it yourselves. The important thing is ensuring your visit goes as smoothly as possible. If you do not mind me asking, are you feeling well today?”
>”Yeah, I am now,” Rox says, giving you a sideways glance and a smile
>The tiger nods his head and folds his paws on the table
>He drops his voice to a barely audible rumble, making his words resonate within you even more
>”From the moment our children are born — crying and unable to speak — it becomes a full-time commitment trying to make them as happy as possible. Even when they grow older and are capable of communication, a parent continues to struggle in understanding what their children truly need. Seeing distress in their eyes and being unable to rectify the situation is a terrible feeling; it makes a parent feel powerless and lost. I cannot ever hope to fully understand what sort of relationship you share with your mother, Ms. Rox. However, even if what she has said or done is something I would be vehemently against, I would be willing to bet my entire career that her actions were out of the utmost care for you. She only wants what she believes is best for her daughter, and I hope what transpired did not end a family relationship forever.”
 >”I know...” Rox mumbles
>”It is something I am all too familiar with,” Shearod-K continues. “I...often have great difficultly convincing myself that my daughter is happy. She has hidden her emotions from her mother and myself for most of her life, as well as any social connections she might have. I worry she does not have many confidants, let alone individuals she can truly call friends.”
>The tiger’s brow softens, and there’s a profound look of sadness in his grassy eyes
>”If there is anything you could tell me about her...anything at all....”
>You and Rox exchange uneasy looks
>Sherry-K was pretty clear on what she DIDN’T want the two of you to say around her father
>Before either of you can respond, Shearod-K lets out a weary sigh
>”Knowing my daughter, she has already asked you both not to reveal anything for this exact line of questioning. I...understand if you wish to honor her request. That can only mean she has people she can confide in. But...please, does she seem...happy?”
>”She’s getting there,” Rox says. “Sher’s been in a much better mood these last couple of weeks. Even saw her smile once or twice! Trust me, we haven’t given up on her yet.”
>You nod in agreement
>”Thank you, both of you,” Shearod-K says. “That is all I can ask for. Now then, if you would like to take a visit to the breakfast buffet, there is quite the selection for—”
>Rox is gone before he even finishes
>By the time you make it over to the food as well, she’s passing you by with a stack of plates
>The look Shearod-K gives Rox’s meal makes you think the wolfess might have a bigger appetite than even he does
>This whole trip has been people staring in your direction, though this time it’s from the wolf wolfing down her food
>It’s a feast that soon leads to some discreet, under-the-table belly rubs as the wolfess moans her regrets
>”Eyes bigger than your stomach?” Shearod-K chuckles amusedly
>”Sorry,” the wolfess grunts. “It just all looked too good. Not used to eating better than ramen....”
>The tiger stares blankly
>”As in, just the noodles? Nothing else?”
>”Hey, they come with flavor packets,” Rox shrugs
>”Remarkable. I cannot fathom how you manage to perform your park duties on such a meager diet.”
>”Well, I usually eat more than one at a time.”
>It looks like there’s a hint of genuine fear on the tiger’s face, as though he’s trying to imagine what such a frugal, barebones life would be like
>Once your meals settle, the three of you head back to the concierge for checkout and then Shearod-K’s car for one last trip into the downtown square
>There’s still notable excitement from the bystanding anthros who haven’t had the chance to meet you yet, and you spend a little time shaking paws and taking pictures
>”Overall, I would say this has been a successful first outing, no?” Shearod-K says as you pile back into his SUV for the return trip to the station
>”Sure. I’d come back again,” Rox says
>It didn’t end up as tragic and unpleasant as your worst dreams had worried you with, at least
>The anthros accepted you for the most part, as did one-half of Rox’s parents
>It could have been a LOT worse, all things considered
>”I feel much more comfortable allowing the two of you to return on your own in the future,” Shearod-K says. “Anon appears to be getting acclimated to our local populace quite nicely, and you, Mr. Rox, seem to have his safety and best interests in mind; very commendable behavior for both his guardian and a representation for the Whimsey Corporation. If you require my assistance for subsequent visits, however, do not hesitate to contact me.”
>”Thanks, Mr. K,” Rox says. “We’ll keep that in mind. It was a pretty memorable time...for the most part.”
>The anthros of Moreau look disappointed to see you leave so soon — the ones eager to see you in the first place, anyway — and there’s a small gathering ready to see you off
>If the next anthro town you visit is just as welcoming as this one, then things will only get easier from here on out 

>It’s a long monorail ride back, though you and Rox nap through most of it
>Not because you’re still tired, but because it’s a great opportunity to get some relaxing, cozy time together
>It seems like life in Whimsey World always finds ways to keep you both busy, and you realize you haven’t had many chances to take it easy and enjoy the companionship of your wolfess
>Sure, you share the same bed, but rarely do you use your free time to just do absolutely nothing together
>Hand in paw, you lean against Rox’s shoulder and lose yourself in her softness while the tiger sitting across from you is absorbed in his puzzles once more
>Without the fear of meeting the people of Moreau or meeting Rox’s parents, all of the tension of the trip is gone
>Now you’re practically looking forward to getting back to work tomorrow, as well as seeing what the future has in store with Rox’s new role in the park
>The three of you arrive back at the Cast Complex around late afternoon, and Shearod-K follows you all the way back to Rox’s car
>It’s strange how walking through the station makes it feel as though you’ve left the anthro world, even though you’re still very much in it
>Not as many strangers give you curious looks on the way back as they did going through the turnstiles the first time, and many regard you like they would one of their own
>It’s both relieving and a little disappointing; the feeling of being a rock star is just about over
>At least for you, anyway
>”I look forward to your opening performance, Ms. Rox,” Shearod-K says. “Just as Anon has taken a great leap forward in this integration process, your exposure to the humans will serve a much similar purpose. Although your role will be much less direct, it will be a momentous occasion nonetheless and open many opportunities for the company.”
>”Easy there...you’re gonna scare me out of it, big guy” Rox laughs
>You share your final goodbyes, and then it’s just you and Rox left
>The car ride back to the apartment, much like the rest of the return trip, has that same bittersweetness
>Still, it’ll be good to be home
>”We’ll go back soon,” Rox says confidently. “And next time we’ll take Chee with us. I kind of feel bad we didn’t get her anything to bring back. Man, I’m still terrible at getting gifts....”
>You try to think of some way to reassure Rox that your mutual roommate would probably be fine without getting any more presents, but luckily you don’t have to say a word
>As soon as you open the apartment door, you’re greeted with stacks and stacks of boxes all with [CHEE] written on them in thick marker and the same iconic Whimsey penmanship all the employees are encouraged to practice
>The oriole is in the middle of the living room, pulling a strangely familiar Whimsey tissue dispenser out of one of them
>”Aw, Chee!” Rox groans loudly, slapping herself in the forehead. “We were gone for ONE night!”
>”O-oh! Welcome home, you two!” the bird sings, hastily dropping the tissue dispenser and wading through the boxes to greet you
>”Don’t you have ENOUGH of this crap?” Rox says
>She tries to casually shove one of the boxes out of the way, but it’s far heavier than she expected
>”How much did you spend on all this!?”
>”N-nothing!” Chee whines. “Honest! This is all from Sherry-K! She brought it over this afternoon!”
>”...Wait, really?” Rox says. “Then where did SHE get all this stuff from?”
>Oh, that’s right...
>Neither Chee nor Rox probably knows the true extent of just how much of a Whimsey nut the tigress is, and how her collection put even Chee’s to shame
>”I dunno,” Chee says, “but she said she needed to get rid of it. It sounded like she said a ‘new roommate’ was moving in with her, but I always thought she lived by herself?”
>A smug look infects the wolfess
>”A new roomy, huh? Geeee, I wonder who it could be? Well, good for her! The kitty could use someone to keep around at night.”
>Maybe now Sherry-K won’t be so hesitant to let others come and visit either, if her apartment doesn’t look like someone blew up the world’s biggest Whimsey World gift store in her place
>Rox sifts through another one of the boxes, then slams the flaps closed
>”Still, you’re not keeping this all here!” she says. “You don’t have nearly enough space in your bedroom, and we’re not going to flood the living room with it!”
>”D-don’t worry, Roxie!” Chee says. “I’ll just get another storage unit! I’ll have it all cleaned up by tom—“
>”’ANOTHER storage unit?’ You mean you already HAVE one for your Whimsey hoard?”
>Boy, you honestly missed this kind of interaction, even though the poor bird looks like she’s on the verge of tears
>Rox must have missed it too, because her reproach quickly dies down and she’s left with an almost unsettlingly warm smile and an apologetic sigh
>”Alright, it’s fine, Chee. Just...have this stuff organized when you get around to it, okay?”
>Chee nods intensely, happy she has a little more time to go through her newly obtained treasures
>Rox beckons the oriole in for a hug, and you take the hint to join in on the love
>”What would we do without you, mama bird?” the wolfess chuckles
>Wrapped between fur and feathers, you can proudly say you’re home
>Home with your family



[[ CHAPTER 35: Soft Rox ]]

>It’s a relatively peaceful morning that eases you back into the routine of Whimsey servitude
>Chee made a filling breakfast for you and Rox, just as she said she would, then returned to sorting through her inherited Whimsey memorabilia
>The ride to the park was painless, and the crowds that showed up for today were small and manageable
>For the most part
>The cheerfulness that Rox entered with soon reverted back to her usual ways: grumbling about the guests and complaining about the stuffy mascot costume she has to wear
>It’s just like how she used to be, before her determined push to earn that spot in the mascot initiative
>Which is why you can’t exactly blame her; it’s not that she doesn’t care about her job, it’s that she’s looking forward to the day when she doesn’t have to be crammed into the Whirly Barf anymore
>It’ll be quite the new adventure for the both of you, so it’s best to enjoy how things are while you still can
>And what better way to make everything feel like the “good old times” than a trip to Sherry-K’s office?
>You’re summoned by the tigress halfway through your shift, putting Rox in a bit of a sour mood as she thinks you’re both in trouble for something...yet again
>”Shouldn’t have put your hands down my back out in the open like that, Anon,” Rox scolds you. “It didn’t need scratching THAT badly.”
>Great, you’re getting the blame as usual
>”Uh, I mean, you shouldn’t have LET me put your hands down my back,” the wolfess says when you give her a stern look
>That’s better, sort of
>”You didn’t even hit all the good spots, either,” she mutters under her breath
>You sigh and try to continue where you left off with Rox’s back scratching, but she dodges your hand
>”Nope, too late. We’re upgrading to ears and tail later, depending on how much trouble you put us...er, that WE got into.”
>What would you do without her?
>Sherry-K is waiting patiently in her office when you enter, though it’s Rox who gets the first word in
>”So, what’s the big idea flooding our apartment with all that Whimsey stuff?” Rox says. “Chee’s got enough of the junk already. I’m trying to get her to stop bringing so much of it home as it is!” 
>”Afternoon, Roksa, Anon,” Sherry-K says calmly. “Please let Chee know I have a few more things for her whenever she’s ready to collect them. There are some fairly large items I need to relocate as soon as possible.”
>”You’re not listening at all, are you?” Rox grumbles
>The tigress grabs a thick stack of fresh, shrink-wrapped books and dumps them into the wolfess’ arms
>”I don’t need any more stuff either!” Rox says
>”This is mandatory for your job,” Sherry-K says. “For BOTH of you. These are the employee manuals detailing extremely sensitive workplace guidelines regarding the mascot initiative. Included within are the expectations of your new roles, as well as the appropriate character scripts for your Meet-and-Greets and the updated Whimsical Nights performances. Tomorrow will be costume fitting and the first day of rehearsals. I trust you will be on time.”
>So much information is thrown at you at once that it takes a moment to parse it all
>Rox tries her best, stammering a response
>”Wha...the mascot...starting already? Tomorrow!?”
>”Indeed,” the tigress says. “Your debut will be during the revamped Whimsical Knights stage show when it returns one month from now. Not much will change apart from the second-act inclusion of the new cast of characters — such as yours — but upper Whimsey management has expressed the desire to begin rehearsing immediately so that all the stage actor are familiar with their parts by the time the show launches.”
>”No way...” Rox gasps. “Why now? Why didn’t we get any more warning?”
>”Orders from Mr. D. Whimsey Jr. himself,” Sherry-K says. “He has been trying to keep the details of the updated performance a mystery from the media and would like the first showing to be a surprise to everyone not actively involved in the production. Whimsey employment has an idea of what will happen, but the specifics are being kept under wraps for the most part. If you haven’t already spoiled your new role to everyone yet, I’d encourage you to remain quiet until the big day.”
>”Pfft, yeah, sure,” Rox says. “You asked the wrong wolf to keep her mouth shut.”
>Sherry-K gives her a stony glare, and the wolfess throws her paws up apologetically
>”E-easy, Sher! Joking! Only Anon and Chee know what’s going on. I’ve only told my folks that I got promoted; they don’t know anything else.”
>”Good. Let’s keep it that way for now, please. You may drop your belongings off at your lockers before heading back out. I expect the two of you to finish off the rest of your shift strongly. Barring unpredictable circumstances, I don’t expect either of you will be returning to these particular roles again.”
>The tigress dismisses you, and the walk back through the tunnels is silent
>You’d think Rox would be more enthusiastic, but she’s strangely reserved

>The remainder of your shift blows by like it’s nothing
>A few more photos and autographs, and the day ends with one last ride-along on Starlight Summit
>Rox manages to keep her energy level peaked the whole time, as though nothing has changed
>It isn’t until the two of you are sitting backstage waiting for the last few minutes of your shift to crawl by that the wolfess seems to crash
>She pulls off her mascot mask and stares into the Whirly Barf’s dopey, unfocused eyes
>”So...this is it, I guess,” Rox says. “May be the last time I’ll ever have the chance to wear this thing.”
>She runs her paw over the costume’s fake fur, stopping at all the little rips and seams that only someone as familiar with the suit as she is could find
>”Feels like every time I ask for something, I’m not happy with what I get in return,” she chuckles grimly. “Wanted some private time for the two of us, and we almost lost Chee. Wanted to show you the castle, and I had a meltdown. Wanted to get rid of this ratty thing for years, and now I almost...miss him already.”
>The two canines are snout-to-snout as Rox has a moment of reflection
>It’s a pause that gives you time to think of your own history with the costume, and how Whirly was technically all you saw Rox as for months when you started working alongside her
>It will definitely be weird to never see her wearing the costume anymore, though you try not to feel too broken up about it
>The suit is still unflattering and a struggle to perform in, after all, and some poor soul like Baggy will probably take up the mantle
>You don’t think it will take Rox long to get over it
>She breaks her moment of silence to slide her paw into your pocket, fishing around for one of your autograph pens
>The suddenness of her probing paw makes you flinch, and Rox blows you a kiss when she finds her pen
>”Relax, stud. We’ll save THAT kind of digging around for later.”
>It looks like she’s about to put the mask back on, but instead she peers around the folds and inner seams of the Whirly head trying to find something
>The perfect spot to leave her mark
>Rox reaches inside and carefully signs her name on a strip of fabric by the nose holes, where it would be impossible to see unless you were specifically looking for it
>”There we go,” she mutters, popping the cap back on the pen and giving the mask one last examination
>She kisses the mask on its bulbous black nose
>”Gonna feel weird not wearing you anymore, old pal,” she says. “Can’t say we haven’t had our hardships, but it’s been an honor working with you. Hope you get a good replacement.”
>Rox holds the Whirly Barf up to your face
>”Want to give him a goodbye kiss, too?”
>You think you’ll be fine without it
>”Aww, come on!” Rox says, waving the mask even closer. “You might not get the chance again! Just give him a little tongue....”
>She grabs the pink, food-speckled tongue and wags it by your mouth
>You dodge and lean out of the way
>Rox teases you for a while, and you make a break for it when you’re saved by the end of the shift
>”Don’t make him sad! Just a little kiss!”
>Rox chases you all the way to costuming, whipping the mask’s tongue at you the entire time

>The anticipation for the next day of work makes it hard to relax when you get home
>You sit on Rox’s lap on the couch — thankfully accessible now that Chee has cleared the living room of all her boxes — and the two of you skim through the employee manuals for a while
>There’s nothing really exciting about the manuals; it’s just the same kind of corporate jargon and rules you remember almost nodding off to when you sat through Whimsey orientation the first time
>What not to do or say when you’re on the job, warnings not to attack the guests, et cetera...
>You don’t learn much about the job, but at least you can honestly tell Sherry-K you read through it
>You can already tell you won’t get much sleep, whether from your own anxiousness or Rox’s
>The two of you decide to turn in for the night early, but it’s much later before your excess energy runs out and you’re able to fall asleep in the arms of your wolfess
>Rox just stares up at the ceiling, taking drawn-out breaths and occasionally nuzzling your face until she’s able to drift off into slumber herself after her routine of “I love yous”
>Morning soon comes, and your adrenaline is quick to wake you up before the alarm has the chance to
>It’s the first time in a while that Rox doesn’t need to be forcefully dragged out of bed, either
>In fact, both of you get up before even Chee does
>Seeing the bird trudge out of her bedroom rubbing the sleep from her eyes is a sight you should have gotten a camera ready for; a rare, white whale kind of opportunity you almost think you’re hallucinating
>”Morning, you two,” Chee yawns. “Sorry I couldn’t get breakfast ready by the time you got up.”
>”Don’t worry about it, Chee,” Rox says, handing the bird a plate. “I got it covered this time.”
>The Princess Glacika pancakes look deformed and slightly burnt, but the thoughtful gesture refuels Chee more than the food
>Everyone’s back at maximum energy in no time, and Rox doesn’t even wait until when you normally leave the apartment (on days you’re actually running on time) before she’s pulling both you and the bird out the door
>”R-Roxie! I still need my uniform!”
>The drive over is a blur, and poor Chee is racing along with you and Rox as though she believes she’s in just as much of a rush as you are
>Even when the bird splits off in the direction of her own park attraction, she’s hopping along like she’s about to be late
>”Have a good day!” she cries out seconds before disappearing down the tunnels, then shrieking as she collides with someone around the corner
>Poor girl...
>You and Rox are heading over to where the backstage of the Whimsical Knights attraction is, both of you feeling somewhat naked not being in your usual uniforms and costumes
>The curious glances from passing coworkers don’t help things either
>”Why aren’t you in your costume, Rox?” they say. “You didn’t get in trouble again, did you?”
>”Yeah, got the pink slip at last,” the wolfess says. “Anon as well. Well, nice knowing you guys!”
>The cheery way she says it and the unexpectedness of her announcement creates some very shocked, downright terrified expressions
>A few anthros even take off quickly in the other direction, either to spread the bad news or out of fear that the wolfess has snapped and is ready to begin her rampage through the park
>She might not be blabbing about the Whimsical Knights surprise like Sherry-K warned her not to, but Rox still managed to find a way to get everyone talking about her regardless
>The resulting gossip coming from all of this by the end of the day will certainly be priceless to hear
>You arrive at the backstage of the Whimsical Knights set, and both of you are immediately greeted with applause
>Stagehands, a few construction workers, some park coordinators...
>And in the center of them all: Chobbo the dog
>Rox laughs nervously at all the attention, and you have to lead her by the paw just to get her to talk to the old beagle
>”Well now,” Chobbo says, giving you and Rox a vigorous handshake. “The big stars have arrived! Are ya’ ready for a new adventure?”
>”Y-yeah, sure thing,” Rox stutters. “Good to see you again, Chobbo!”
>”Didn’t want to miss a day like this one,” the beagle says. “Junior couldn’t make it, but I’m sure he’ll be stopping in to check up on how things are getting along. Needs to give the troops some morale after all...and sign the checks, too! Bwohoho!”
>The dog roars at his own joke, getting everyone else to join in just by the humorousness of how loud he is
>He continues laughing even after the others are done, only stopping himself when his laughs turn into equally powerful coughing
>”You alright, Chobbo?” Rox chuckles weakly
>The old dog nods his head and dabs his mouth with a handkerchief
>”Heard the two of you took a little trip to Moreau recently,” Chobbo says. “Hope the locals treated you well and everything?”
>He looks specifically to you when he speaks
>You give him a quick recount of your visit, focusing on mostly the positives out of politeness
>Rox is the one who gives the more “unfortunate” side of the tale
>”Had some problems with my folks...uh, just one of them, anyway,” she explains. “But Mr. K made sure we didn’t get into any serious trouble.”
>”Bless that man,” Chobbo says. “He might be an uptight, no-fun pencil pusher at times, but he’s got his heart in the right place. Ahh, I’m sorry you had a little trouble while you were there, but Ol’ Whiskers called us up as soon as he dropped you off to say how well everything went. Sounds like he might have embellished a little bit of the story, but...well, it put a tear in Junior’s eye to get that news. Darwin was getting to be a jitterbug when he was told you two were going to Moreau. I think he wanted to be there with you instead of leaving everything up to Shearod-K.”
>Chobbo’s sagging brow lifts up just enough for you to see his dark, beady eyes and the hope he has in them
>”You two did a great thing this last weekend, more than you probably realize. Darwin is finally getting to see his daddy’s dream realized, bit-by-bit, but he still needs someone to carry on after us old farts are gone. Hearing all the hubbub coming from Moreau was like hearing the excitement of guests on Whimsey World’s opening day...all those years ago. It’s going to make this show so much sweeter when we can get everyone out there on stage, dancin’ and singin’ together like we might see outside the park grounds someday. In the meantime, I can’t wait to see the finished thing myself. I frankly haven’t been this thrilled myself in ages...probably not since I found a new favorite flavor of gelatin last week!”
>He grabs his chest and breaks out into even more laughter, though it’s much more controlled this time
>”Rox, Anon!”
>One of the show coordinators beckons you over, while several others hold up some costume bags as though trying to bait the two of you to take a look 
>Your new characters are in those bags, waiting to be worn
>”Well, I’d best leave you kids to your practicin’,” Chobbo says, patting you and Rox on the shoulders. “I’ll be back later to see how things are looking. Gotta take a nap first, then maybe raid the cafeteria for some of that good pudding. Better use that employee discount while I still have it, right?”
 >His hearty laughter follows him as he hobbles off to the tunnels, and his wheezes echo back long after he’s out of sight
>Rox has a smile of admiration on her muzzle, but you get the feeling there’s a bit of concern in her expression as well
>”Are you two coming?” the coordinator calls out again
>The wolfess snaps back to reality and grabs you around the chest, holding you close under her arm like she used to carry her mascot mask
>”Coming!” she barks, then gives you a friendly smile
>The absurdly goofy look on her face makes even the Whirly Barf look stoic and emotionless by comparison
>”You ready, buddy?” she says
>She nods your head for you as you’re jostled around under her arm, jogging you excitedly toward your new, shared future in the company



[[ CHAPTER 36: King of Rox ]]
 
>You’ve seen it hundreds of times
>A parent holding their child’s hand as they walk through the park, trying to keep the small human being from vibrating off the face of the planet with bountiful excitement that builds and builds the farther into the park they walk
>Many parents are tired before they ever get to the castle, just from the struggle of keeping their children within arm’s reach
>Occasionally you’ll see a parent sharing their child’s enthusiasm, and once in a rare while you’ll even see the grown adult act like an even bigger, giddier kid
>Although you can’t quite match her excitement, the way Rox shakes with joy as you hold her paw gives you that feeling of being the parent for a brief moment, giving an elated pup her first taste of Whimsey World
>Leading her to magic and adventure, while trying your hardest not to have your arm ripped clean out of its socket when she breaks out into a run for the last stretch up to the waiting coordinators
>”Rox, Anon. Plea~zure to meet you,” a female skunk says with a bit of an accent — one that feels a little forced and faked — and a lot of extra flourish
>You’ve seen her only once before since your induction to the “secrets” of Whimsey World; she’s the head of the costuming department for the various anthro species in the company
>Though wearing the same dorky pinstripes that all coordinators are subjected to, the skunk is so gorgeously groomed she actually manages to make the uniform look like a fashionable outfit
>She must even dye her fur, as the parts of her that would be black are in fact a deep plum color
>She waves a pen around like a conductor’s wand, pointing to the costume bags being held by some of the other coordinators nearby
>”Today I will be over’zeeing your costume fitting. Then you will be given your lines and meet with ze’ rest of your troupe. Come come.”
>You and Rox are practically pried apart as two coordinators take you to separate backstage changing stalls
>The next time you see Rox she’s going to be a completely different wolfess, at least visually
>You’re steered toward a private changing stall by a short male lemur with a mouth full of pins and his tail wrapped up in a tape measure
>Once inside, he tugs your clothes and mumbles instructions to disrobe
>Your mascot handler uniform never needed anyone else to help you put it on, but now it seems like you’re going to have to be getting dressed by someone else from now on
>The question is, will it always be an anthro?
>When you ask the lemur this, he gives a very detailed, extensive answer
>Too bad you can’t understand a word he said, though
>The number of components to this costume is staggering, and the whole process takes nearly twenty minutes of standing like a scarecrow while you’re layered with piece after piece
>The lemur is undoubtedly good at what he does, though you can tell he’s taking extra time to examine your human features
>He mumbles something that you can guess might be something along the lines of, “Never thought I’d see one this close.”
>The last part of the costume is the mask: a vibrant, emerald bit of headgear that covers your whole head except for the mouth, complete with sunglasses to cover the narrow eyeholes
>It’s otherwise completely featureless, making you think of a stickman except with green skin
>Kind of makes you feel like a superhero, or a pro wrestler
>The lemur lets you get a view of the entire costume in a full-body mirror
>You look a little like a groupie for some sci-fi rock band: baggy band shirts and dangling glow sticks over a layer of sleeker, futuristic clothes underneath
>The lemur pats you on the back and mumbles a compliment before leading you back out of the changing stall
>The other waiting coordinators clap for your debut as the skunk scans you from head to toe
>”Perfect fit!” she says, waving around a rolled-up poster. “Now, for the young wolf.”
>You turn to the changing stall Rox had been taken to, which is now illuminated with a spotlight from one of the nearby stagehands
>An otter coordinator slips out first, drumming her paw on a clipboard to build up the suspense
>The door then swings open, and out steps a new legend
>”Introdu’zing: Rokk-Woof!”
>You’ve seen the prototypes already, but the finished design tailored perfectly to Rox’s body is something incredible
>The wolfess looks like she just stepped out of the golden age of comics, wearing a mixed sleek and baggy ensemble of clothes and accessories of musical groups through the ages that make her seem like a veritable superhero
>She’s even wearing a domino mask to “hide her identity” and shield her golden eyes, along with a headset that you assume is to keep her ears from moving just as much as it is for giving her discreet directions
>Almost her entire body is covered up, except for her feet, tail, half of her face, and some of her voluminous neck fluff
>The overall silhouette of her wolfish shape is downplayed convincingly, and if this were the first time you saw Rox you would probably believe she was just a human in a (staggeringly convincing) costume
>Maybe in a few years’ time she’ll get a redesign that lets her anthro features be displayed more freely, but at least she’s not in the Whirly Barf anymore
>The applause breaks out again, and this time it’s from the whole backstage
>Rox can’t help but chuckle shyly at the attention
>”The two of make ze’ perfect pair!” the skunk says, unrolling the poster. “Rokk-Woof and one of her ‘Fan-Ons’!”
>Fan-On?
>”Indeed. Ze’ first human out’zide of the Whim’zeys to know our little corner of ze’ park should be immortalized as well, no?”
>The skunk holds up the poster; Rox’s stylized Rokk-Woof character takes up most of the image, but surrounding her are a dozen or so of the masked, featureless looking “groupies” just like you
>They come in a variety of neon colors with minor distinctions of flourishes and adornments, but the most prominent one of the bunch is the green fellow that you’ve been modeled into
>”It just came to me,” the skunk says with a shrug. “I think ze’ green one works well for you. It will be exclusive to you, as well. All ze’ other Rokk-Woof handlers will be in coz’tume, but only ONE will have the exact look that you have.”
>Rox gives the hem of your mask a gentle tug, and even through her domino mask you can tell her eyes are welling up with pride
>”Definitely my biggest Fan-On,” she says with a smirk
>”Zis is quite the honor, I must tell you,” the skunk says. “For Rox, too. Her name is also immortalized in her character.”
>The coordinator points to the stylized ROKK-WOOF logo on the top of the poster
>The double “KK” is actually designed to somewhat resemble an “X”, like “Rox-Woof”
>”There will be many others to wear the coz’tume after you,” the skunk says, “but you will always be the first. An honor indeed!”
>Speaking of others, two more female wolves arrive backstage seconds later
>One’s slightly lighter in color than Rox, while the other is a little taller yet a little more gangly
>You don’t remember ever seeing these particular two since working with the anthros, but then again you’ve only ever had eyes for one wolfess
>”Zey will be your backups, Rox,” the skunk says, motioning to the girls as they’re led by other coordinators to their own costume fitting. “We had to cast zem from out’zide of Whim’zey World. Zey will fill in for you when you cannot work, but otherwise you will be ze’ primary performer.”
>”My own backups...” Rox says quietly
>Technically they’re Rokk-Woof’s, but you’re not going to spoil the mood and take away her moment of feeling like a celebrity
>After all, she is THE main Rokk-Woof...the “Rox-Woof”
>All that hard work she’s put in during the time you’ve known her...not to mention the years she’s put into the company before then
>She deserves this fame
>It’s not you who’s going to be on stage performing for all those guests, but you feel just as proud to be there for the wolfess as she gets to live out the most important role of her life
>This isn’t just a role either: this is something that will bridge the worlds of the humans and the anthros, if only for the first step
>”Once zey are suited up, we will meet your fellow performers,” the skunk says. “And zen we will begin ze’ journey for real.”
>Rox pulls you close, letting out a faint squeal of excitement and whipping her tail around furiously
>You have never seen her looking forward to work quite like this before
 
>You and Rox are given a quick tour of the backstage area to Whimsical Knights as you wait for the wolfess’ costars to show up
>The other coordinators tell you that most of the daily rehearsals will be back here at first, but once it gets closer to the grand reveal of the anthros’ addition to the show you’ll be practicing at night up on the actual stage
>The show is only going to be closed for a few days while the stage itself is worked on for the renovations, so you’ll have to make due with your limited time “up top” to learn the ins and outs of the stage layout
>Not much is really changing overall with the anthros added in, but even the smallest tweaks to the show need to be readily prepared and look as though they’ve always been a part of the act
>Perhaps the biggest change to Whimsical Knights isn’t part of the performance at all
>Below the “front row” seats that the guests have access to is a series of large panes of glass, creating one-way mirrors that hide rows of seats underneath the human guests
>This is where anthro viewers will be able to sit and watch, hidden from the humans above
>It makes you think of The Booze Cruise, peering at the people in the bar below you while you sit up in the anthro-exclusive room
>The stage outside is empty for now, but later in the evening there will be an entire celebration of music, dancing, and fireworks
>”Mr. Whimsey’s idea,” a bison coordinator overseeing the renovations tells you. “Senior, I mean. He wanted this sort of thing to be put in for all the big shows right off the bat, but he didn’t have the money or the support to justify it. Guess his son finally decided there’s some worth to it.”
>While there aren’t nearly as many seats down in the “anthro gallery” as there are on the surface, you could definitely fit in a pretty large sum of viewers
>And the anthros would arguably have some of the best angles to see the performance, too
>”If you haven’t seen the whole show before, you’re going to,” the bison goes on. “Management wants you familiar with all parts of the performance, not just the ones you’ll be in. You’ll be spending part of your shift these first couple of weeks watching the show from down here.”
>Getting paid to watch a show?” Rox says. “Not bad. Kind of like getting paid to go on the rides, right?”
>The bison grunts, a little perturbed by the way Rox is wording it
>”There’s one thing we need to organize ahead of time,” he says, flipping through papers with his massive hands. “The first performance we hold will have a select audience. Company officials, members of the press...and so on. That will also include immediate family members for some of the cast.”
>Uh oh
>Rox’s headset keeps her ears held in place, but you can imagine them wanting to fold back out of concern
>”If there is anyone you would like to invite to the premiere,” the bison says, “please let us know as soon as possible so we can arrange some seats for them.”
>”Yeah...will do,” Rox mumbles
>Doesn’t look like you’re going to get the same privilege, but frankly you don’t think you’re ready to bring your own family down here quite so soon either
>The bison looks beyond the two of you, noticing the new arrivals
>”Looks like the gang’s all here, then,” he says
>The skunk coordinator is back, joined by two more heavily costumed anthro performers
>”Rokk-Woof,” the skunk says with a giggle, “I would like you to meet your co’ztars: the ‘Blue Suede Bear’ and ‘Queen Lulu-by’.”
>Your eyes are drawn to the bear first, mostly because of his sheer size
>Like Rox, he’s dressed like a rock star albeit in a much more “classical” sense
>As his name implies, he seems very heavily modeled after an Elvis stereotype, and his fur has been literally dyed blue as well
>The second one, the queen to compliment “the king”, looks to be some sort of female orangutan
>Her style is more about soothing music, with a jazzy sort of aesthetic and a working saxophone to go along with the whole outfit
>Both of them you think you’ve seen before briefly around the backstage of the park, and they’re very clearly older than Rox is
>No doubt Whimsey picked them because of their experience and tenure with the company, but you also wonder if they were also chosen because they would look the most like people in costumes
>Blue’s large, baggy body would easily house a whole human, while Lulu’s primate heritage already matches the human form extremely well
>Rox was probably the one they had to do the most work on; at least they can cover her legs with skirts and parachute pants, while someone like Chee may have been a lot more difficult to disguise with her avian features
>”Wow, you guys look great!” Rox says, shaking paws with her two costars
>”Why, thank you, dear!” Lulu says in a motherly tone
>”Thank you, thank you very much,” Blue rumbles, raking a claw through his head fur
>Three different icons of music, and three different species of animals
>The Whimsey designers really did a good job creating these characters for the show
>You can already picture toys of the three sitting on the shelves of the gift shops and sitting on the shelves of collectors like Chee
>Maybe Rox will be fine with the bird hoarding more Whimsey stuff if it’s merchandise related to her character...
>You hold back a flinch as you realize you’re now staring at the face of the orangutan, who had just slipped up to you
>”And we all know who YOU are, Anon,” she says sweetly. “My stars...I never thought I would see the day when we’d be working with the humans side by side. I joined this company when I was much, much younger than you...decades ago at this point. But even back then, the good man Whimsey’s dream stuck with all of us. He made us ALL want to see this moment happen. It is good to finally meet you, young man.”
>She cups your hand and shakes it vigorously, while the bear puts a massive paw on your shoulder
>”The pretty mama’s right on the money,” Blue says. “Can’t add much more to that. Looking forward to taking this tour with you, chief.”
>Rox manages to find some room to sneak in and get close to you
>”He’s a great guy!” she says, paw around your waist. “I know he’ll do us proud. I can vouch for him!”
>”We’re going to need a picture of this,” the bison coordinator says, motioning to all four of you so close to one another
>”I will hunt zomeone down,” the skunk coordinator says. “And then, we will go over the zcript, yes?”
>There’s a warm aura as you stay in the huddle with the anthros
>Even for the seasoned ages of the other two — and all the veteran experience they already have with the park — you can tell they’re just as excited as you and Rox for this new adventure
>You might be just a Fan-On in all of this, but the anthros are making you feel like you’re the most important star here
>The skunk returns moments later with a few cameramen
>”Zay ‘cheese’!”
>*CLICK*
>And now you’re seeing even more stars



[[ CHAPTER 37: Rox Opera ]]

>Whimsical Knights is a 3-act stage show in an amphitheater at the far end of Whimsey Park, held when the sun sets and the night sky makes the perfect backdrop for all the lights and fireworks the performance uses
>It’s said that the company spends an upwards of tens of thousands of dollars each show just on the fireworks alone
>It’s the last major live performance held in the park each day, capping off the night for most tired guests before they march back to the front gates and head back to their hotels
>For many park employees, the show is a quiet reprieve when all the other attractions are empty and the mascots get a moment peace before they have to line up by the exits to wave the guests goodnight
>You and Rox generally work the earlier shifts together so you don’t have to worry about hitting the crowds as they pour out of the park, but it looks as though that’s going to change pretty soon
>”Guess we’re on the night team now when this thing starts, huh?” the wolfess says, thumbing through the show script. “Whatever. Just means we get to sleep in a little more the next day, right?”
>Luckily none of the other anthros seem to pick up on the hidden meaning to her words, or the way she lifts her eyebrows at you
>”Nothing’s set in stone,” the bison coordinator says, overhearing Rox’s complaint. “You’ll be starting out at night for a while, but where we go from here depends on the fans’ reaction.”
>”What do you mean?” Rox says. “They wouldn’t get rid of us if the show, uh, doesn’t go as well as they want, will they?”
>”Not likely. Mr. Whimsey will not reverse his changes to the show. If the fans take a liking to you, then Rokk-Woof, Blue Suede Bear, and Lulu-By will be incorporated into other parts of the park. Daytime parades, photos and signings...the works. More face-to-face guest interaction once management feels safe letting you closer to humans in those costumes.”
>That brightens Rox’s mood a bit
>Even on the worst days of work, you know she truly loves being around the humans and making them happy
>If she couldn’t be allowed to pal around with the guests anymore, you know she’d end up being miserable at her job
>Her hopeful smile droops to a frown for a moment, though
>”So...what happens if they don’t like us?” Rox says
>Blue and Lulu look a little troubled as well
>For such a big guy, even the bison coordinator seems uncomfortable now
>”Mr. Whimsey...will make this work,” he says slowly. “Or, at least that’s what he’s told us. That might mean making up different characters and...retiring ones that don’t work until we find ones the humans will accept.”
>The anthro performers look to one another, as though worried one of them is already on the chopping block
>”Well then,” Lulu says firmly, “sounds like we’ll all have to give everything we’ve got to make those folks out there love us, doesn’t it?”
>”You’ve got a good point there, missy,” Blue says, adjusting a tiny pair of sunglasses on his snout
>You sneak a grab at Rox’s paw and she nods in agreement at your squeeze, then she buries her nose into the script and returns to studying it with even greater focus
>It’s going to be a rough month of preparing for the show, but as long as she can keep up this drive the big day will be here before you know it
>Her bear and orangutan costars follow her lead, and the whole room goes quiet while the three of them read their parts
>”We’ll do a rough an’ dirty practice for the last hour or so,” the bison says. “Then the same thing for most of tomorrow, and we’ll finish the shift with watching the whole thing for real from down here. Mr. Whimsey wants you all to ‘visualize yourselves in the show’ or something like that, so we’ll be ending the day with Whimsical Knights at least twice a week until we have to close it for the final renovations.”
>Rox nods as the bison speaks, though it’s clear she’s only half listening; instead she’s paying more attention to the script than the coordinator’s words
>With one paw holding the script and the other holding your hand, the least you can do is turn the pages for her as she reads

>”Aaannnd...action!”
>The three anthro stars spread out from their marked starting spots, moving along to the prerecorded music of Whimsical Knights’ second act
>Rox energetically stomps in wide arcs, Lulu sways around with a melody on her saxophone, and Blue gyrates his hips in graceful circles
>They’ve done this routine a few dozen times now between today and yesterday, and there’s been noticeable improvement with every attempt
>There isn’t much for you to do during the rehearsals, even though you’ve technically been included into the performance as well
>Your mission is to appear along with Rokk-Woof, join the stagehands dressed like her other Fan-Ons, and help them pull the pieces of the stage in the right spots as the show transitions into the second act
>Then you wait close to the audience and get them pumped up and ready to cheer for the newest stars
>Not the most glamorous or integral role in the show, but then again you’re not exactly a performer to begin with
>Still, you’ve been told your part in the show might get bigger down the line if you do a good enough job being the bench-warming sidekick
>After all, you ARE Rokk-Woof’s #1 Fan-On
>None of the other Fan-Ons even know who (or what) the new characters really are, and right now they’re probably practicing their roles with the other humans on the empty stage outside
>You’re the only one who gets to come out from backstage with Rokk-Woof when your part begins, and you’re the only one who’s allowed to get close to her at any point in the performance
>It’s just as much of an honor as it is a huge responsibility
>You watch the rehearsal quietly as the anthros move around in circles and wave to invisible audience members
>Their role in the show will be pretty short, comparatively speaking, but with this much tension and anxiety building up for the big debut each second will easily feel like an eternity to them
>Every second on stage is another chance to majorly screw something up or potentially blow the cover of every anthro in Whimsey World, and that’s a fear that’s doubtlessly going through all of their minds
>It sounds like management has contingency plans set up in case there’s some kind of “accident” that exposes what the performers really are, but if such an accident would occur it would surely mean someone’s losing their job in the company for good
>If everyone suddenly found out anthros were real, would the park close down for damage control or would things continue on as though nothing out of the ordinary ever happened?
>The three anthros hold their poses as the music peters out, then they reset back to their starting positions to prepare for another round
>The coordinator in charge of the choreography, an older mouse with massive round ears, claps his paws with a goofy chuckle
>”Alright, that’s a wrap for today, everyone,” he says. “Good work! You can change out of your costumes now, and we’ll end the day watching the show from the good seats!”
>”We’re gonna get so sick of seeing this thing, aren’t we?” Rox whispers to you as she begins to take her domino mask off
>But she breaks out into a grin and nudges you in the side jokingly
>She’s never going to be sick of the show when she’s seeing it from Rokk-Woof’s perspective
>Once back in her casual jeans and t-shirt, Rox wraps her paw around you and the group heads into the underground viewing room for Whimsical Knights
>You pick some seats away from the rest of the production crew and performers for privacy, and Rox kicks her feet up onto the chair in front of you
>”Ooohh-ho-ho-ho...” she groans, flexing her toes. “They’re killing me....”
>The wolfess leans in closer and practically sticks her snout into your ear
>”What am I gonna have to do to convince you to add some foot massages into the routine?”
>You can feel the tip of her tongue poking against your cheek
>It’s not long before the speakers turn on, and you can hear the growing commotion of the human guests topside as they file into the amphitheater
>It startles you for a second, as the walls are so heavily soundproofed (so that the humans don’t hear the anthros below) that you couldn’t hear the hundreds of people swiftly gathering above you
>All of the sound from the performance is going to be picked up from outside via microphones, which is a bit of a bummer for the anthros in terms of getting to hear the audio naturally
>Though at least they don’t have to worry about the outside weather as much as the humans
>And the view is still pretty amazing down here as well
>”Ladies and Gentlemen, boys and girls...” the announcer drones
>Rox mutters along with the entire opening spiel mockingly
>You both knew the whole thing by heart even before starting the rehearsals, as the booming voice can be heard across almost half of the theme park every single night
>The sounds of the show have been engraved into your mind, much like the safety recordings for getting on rides or entering the monorails
>Please stand clear of the doors...please stand clear of the doors...
>The number of times you’ve actually SEEN the whole Whimsical Knights show, however, is much, much lower
>Much like the name suggests, it’s a show about many of Whimsey’s iconic hero characters set to various classic songs as they repel the villains and bring all kinds of warm, gooey feelings to the world
>The first two acts are all about introducing the characters and dancing along to memorable Whimsey-film melodies, while the final act is the big showdown with the big baddies
>Sparklers and fireworks are shot off throughout, and the finale is a nonstop barrage of explosions seen and heard from all corners of the resort grounds
>Rokk-Woof and her partners are being added just to the second act for now (which has been notorious for being duller than the rest of the show), but once again only time will tell if they’ll be allowed into the finale to fight the final battle against the villains
>Knowing Rox, she wouldn’t think twice about getting the chance to be a hero like that
>You look over to the wolfess and see that she’s nodded off in her seat
>Now it’s your turn to nudge her in the side, trying to keep her awake for the rest of the shift so the coordinators don’t see her passed out
>Her eyes snap open and she instinctively tightens her hold on you, mellowing out when she sees that you’re still there safely next to her
>”Did I miss my cue?” she mumbles with a stifled yawn
>She’s going to be sleeping like a rock tonight...

>The first week and a half of rehearsals have gone extremely well, you’d say
>Rox drags you out of bed bright and early, and the two of you get suited up well before either of her costars do each day
>There’s an incredible amount of vigor in her body every morning
>By noon she’s well into her groove and settled into her element
>By the afternoon she’s panting and breathing heavily, but never without an enormous grin on her lips
>And by the end of the shift she’s exhausted to the point of unconsciousness
>You’ve had to help carry her back inside the apartment a couple of times now, with Chee doing her best to be a great roommate and caretaker
>She has dinner waiting each night, hovering over Rox’s shoulder begging to hear how your rehearsals went
>Though in truth she just might be trying to squeeze some early secrets out of the wolfess...
>”Ah, Chee, come on,” Rox mutters, waving away the bird’s prying questions. “You’re gonna have to wait until the big show like everyone else. Don’t you want it to be a surprise?”
>”Ooohhh, but I can’t waaaiiit, Roxie!” Chee pouts. “You said you were at least going to show me a picture of the costume!”
>Yeah, well, that was before I realized just how serious they are about this thing,” Rox says. “We don’t even get to have our phones close by. You should have seen what happened yesterday, too. I tried to head out to the cafeteria on our lunch break in my costume and they nearly had me strip naked on the spot before walking out!”
>”They wouldn’t do that...” Chee scoffs
>”Yeah, you’re right. I was just going to go and strip down myself to see what they’d say. Hah!”
>You roll your eyes
>Hopefully Rox’s success isn’t going to her head
>On the other hand, she’s always been like that; like pulling you into the girls’ locker room and peeling her costume off right in front of you with no shame
>”Well, fine,” Chee says with her beak upturned. “If you’re not going to tell me anything, then I’m not going to tell you MY secret....”
>Rox laughs at the bird’s bluff while the oriole folds her wings
>The longer the silence drags on for, though, the more curious the wolfess gets
>”...Why? What’s your secret?” Rox asks. “What happened?”
>”I’m not tel~ling you,” Chee sings. “You’re going to have to trade me a peek at your outfit first!”
>”Chee....”
>”Nope! Fair’s fair! You’ll just have to wait until the big night, then. Goodnight!”
>The bird may be curious herself to see Rox’s outfit, but she’s incredibly smug about having her own secret, and so she skips off to her bedroom teasingly
>Rox’s golden eyes have never looked bigger
>”What do you think she’s keeping from us?” she whispers to you
>You just shrug
>The wolfess tosses around ideas for a while, but just like every other night her accumulated fatigue from a full day of dancing soon wears her down to the point she can’t think straight anymore
>You have to drag her off to bed and tuck her under the covers, and only minutes after her head hits the pillow she’s already asleep
>Not before she gives you her nightly “I love you”, though
>In fact, she’s so concerned with making sure she doesn’t forget those three words that she’s been waking up in the middle of the night to remind you of her love again and again
>And for good measure, she starts adding the routine to the morning as well
>”Feels like we’ve been moving nonstop,” she laughs and yawns at the same time when you wake up. “Damn, we’re going to have to do something fun the next time we have off. I don’t want to waste the whole weekend napping, heh....”
>Admittedly, it sounds like a good way to spend the weekend
>With how crazy the previous weekend was in Moreau — and all the Whimsical Knights preparing that’s gone on since then — you’ll take whatever chill time you can get before the debut performance
>”Don’t forget, we need to save up and go back to Moreau soon,” Rox says, pulling you out of bed. “I want at least one night in one of those snazzy rooms again to celebrate when this is all over!”
>When she says “save up”, you don’t think she’s only talking about money
>Rox gives you a sly wink
>Chee has already left for the morning, so it’s up to Rox to make enough ambient noise for the whole apartment as she quickly gets ready for the new workday
>She’s humming for breakfast, whistling as you head out the door, and belting out a song as you drive together to the park grounds
>”Another day to give—it—our—all!” she pounds on the steering wheel before shooting out of the car and into the parking lot
>Then she pounds on your back a few times affectionately while you walk through the employee tunnels
>”It’s been fun so far,” Rox sighs, “but I’m aching to be OUT there on the stage and get this over with. The suspense is killing me.”
>The two of you pass a few other anthros in the tunnels as you usually do, but something feels...off
>Everyone you walk by looks glum and somber
>”Geez, what’s with these guys?” Rox says under her breath
>It really is EVERYONE who’s acting like this, and they’re all too absorbed in their dark clouds to pay you or Rox any attention
>You eventually pass Chee’s gull friend Petch, who’s actually in tears
>”Hey, Petch,” Rox calls back, “what’s...?”
>But she’s already gone, sobbing audibly off in the distance
>Never mind, THIS is the biggest you’ve ever seen Rox’s eyes before
>”I don’t like this, Anon,” she says. “What happened here?”
>On your way to the Whimsical Knights portion of the backstage tunnels, you pass by a very familiar office with the door slightly ajar
>Rox picks up her pace and slips inside with you following at her tail
>”Hey, Sher, what’s going on?” Rox says
>The wolfess tries to make it sound like a friendly greeting, but the panic in her voice is unmistakable
>Sherry-K, in one of the rare occasions you’ve actually seen her sitting down, jerks her head up in surprise
>Her ears, however, remain flat
>”O-oh, Roksa, Anon...how are you today?”
>Her grassy eyes are surrounded by a flare of red, like a burning sunset over the savanna
>”Sher...what’s wrong?” Rox says
>The tigress stands up and slowly paces over to you
>Rox’s breathing gets quicker with each step the tigress takes
>”You’re kinda scaring me here, Sher,” Rox says with a nervous chuckle
>”Roksa....”
>Sherry-K clutches at her chest, as if grasping at an invisible clipboard
>She takes a deep breath and looks from Rox to you, back and forth, unsure where to start
>”It’s Chobbo,” she finally says. “He...he passed away....”
>Rox’s breathing stops
>”No...wh...no...how?” she barely makes out
>”He’s kept the severity of his health issues private for a while now,” Sherry-K continues, sounding hoarser by the second. “He...didn’t want anyone to know how bad things were getting recently. In retrospect, I feel the signs were evident. But he...fortunately...went very peacefully in his sleep late last night, from what I’ve been told.”
>Sherry-K quickly spins on her heels and faces away from you, wringing her paws behind her back
>”Mr. D Whimsey Jr. would like to say a few words to everyone tomorrow evening. We will be pausing the rehearsals during that time so everyone can join him in the conference hall. It’s not mandatory, however. I would understand if either of you would not wish to be there.”
>There’s a long pause, then a single sniff coming from the tigress
>”I apologize for breaking the news to you like this. In spite of these recent developments, I hope I can trust the two of you to continue performing at your usual level of professionalism. I’m sure...I’m sure h-he would have wanted the same...from everyone.”
>Sherry-K stands like a statue, except for her writing, trembling paws
>The tigress doesn’t say another word, just keeping her back to you
>Keeping the silence heavy, her emotions blank, and leaving you and Rox to exit her office with a pall of gloom still hanging in the air
>You think Rox must have held her breath the whole time, not even blinking as you resume your trip to the Whimsical Knights backstage
>So of course it startles you a little when she lets out a sharp, sudden laugh that sounds more like a cough
>She’s shown her sadness before, but not this kind of grief
>It’s kind of a foreign emotion for her, and she can only express it with weird, broken chuckles and misplaced humor
>”Boy, that’s a shitty, shitty way to start off a shift, h-hah,” Rox says, still not blinking
>You put your arms around her, but the wolfess doesn’t respond as she normally would
>The tragic news completely stupefied her, sending her mind far away as she processes what she just heard
>But the more you hold her — squeeze her — the more she gradually comes back to reality
>”I would...really like to hear what Whimsey has to say tomorrow,” she says. “You, uh, think you want to go?”
>You feel like you’re obligated to
>It wouldn’t be right to miss it; not after the kindness and support Chobbo showed the two of you
>”Y-yeah...thanks,” Rox says, as though thanking you for a deeply personal request of her own
>Today’s going to be a struggle, that’s guaranteed
>And tomorrow feels like such a long way off



[[ CHAPTER 38: Psychedelic Rox ]]

>There’s a dismal smog over Whimsey World unlike any you’ve ever seen before
>This amount of gloom in what is always heralded as the “happiest place on the face of the planet” shouldn’t ever exist
>As an employee, you know full well that it’s not always smiles and forced positivity, but to see these looks of sorrow and defeat amongst your coworkers makes it feel as though the park was struck with an apocalyptic catastrophe
>For the anthros of the park, it might as well be
>Whimsey Jr. may be the face of the entire company, but Chobbo was the one many of them looked up to
>The old dog knew what it was like to have to live in secrecy, more than his closest human friend ever will, yet he always maintained a sense of optimism and joy
>And in the short time you’ve known him, it feels like he made an impact on you as well
>The news of Chobbo’s passing has already hit ever corner of the park, if not the entirety of anthro society by now, and despite the anthros’ best efforts to stay strong their pain seems to be leaking out into the rest of the grounds
>Over the course of your shift you hear the frustrations of the coordinators as they are given reports about how the performance quality of the employees is slipping
>The human guests have no clue what’s really happening behind the scenes, but they’re starting to suspect something’s wrong
>There are anthros running the rides, cooking the food, and answering customer service phone calls, and from the sounds of it there are a lot of slowdowns and mistakes being made
>All of the anthros in the mascot costumes are pulled from their positions and replaced with human performers for the day, and soon the anthro tunnels are barren from so many employees being sent home early
>In spite of everything, the newest trio of Whimsical Knights tries their best to keep their emotions out of their rehearsals
>Rox dances with most of the intensity she’s been putting into her usual practice, though her faked smile looks pained in a way that makes you think of someone constantly stepping on nails
>Blue and Lulu, meanwhile, are visibly distraught and make minor mistakes with each practice attempt
>Being quite a bit older than either you or Rox, they’ve no doubt known about (and looked up to) Chobbo much longer
>Eventually, even the coordinators seem too shaken up to continue rehearsal, and you’re all set free for the evening
>”We’ll pick it up tomorrow...” the mouse coordinator sighs before shuffling off with a slumped back
>No longer obligated to maintain her smile, Rox’s lips and ears droop down low
>You ask if she’s all right, and after a short pause the wolfess nods her head slowly
>”I will be, don’t worry,” she says. “But...hey, if we’re already done for the day, there’s something I want to do quickly before we head out.”
>She doesn’t say anything else as you shed your costumes and make your way through the tunnels
>You’re not heading toward the parking lot, though; she’s leading you deeper into the park grounds toward Rumble Rolloff
>None of the anthros working behind the scenes pay you any attention — just as glum as the rest of their peers — as you slip into the attraction’s backstage and through a familiar hidden passage
>Back to Rox World
>The chalkboard above the makeshift ticket booth advertising [ ____ World ] looks like it’s been written over and erased several times since you’ve last been here, though you can faintly see Rox’s ghostly name in the cloud of smudges
>The wolfess grabs some chalk and begins to write on the sign in large, thick letters
>You can guess what she’s doing from the first stroke she makes
>[ Chobbo World ]
>With little cartoon dog faces in the O’s
>Rox steps back to admire her handiwork, standing in silence and rolling the stick of chalk around in her paw
>You were almost expecting her to break down now that the two of you are somewhat alone, but the wolfess remains surprisingly resolute
>”We’re gonna miss you, buddy...” she mumbles, then flicks the moisture off her nose
>You give Rox some comfort in your arms, and she holds you tightly in return
>She rubs you on the cheek, then laughs in embarrassment
>”Whoops! Sorry, Anon,” she says, dusting the chalk off your face
>Rox wipes your cheek a bit before giving it a wet kiss to make up for it
>Seems she’s holding out much better than you feared she would
>”Yeah...I think I’ll pull through,” Rox says. “He was kind of a legend to all of us, but...I guess we never really knew him for too long, did we?. Probably would have been harder news to stomach if we were much closer to the guy. Still...man, this sucks. He was such a sweet dog, and funny as hell. I can’t imagine how the others are taking it.”
>Rox grimaces at the thought
>”Like Chee. The girl’s probably going to be beside herself when we get back home. Ah, we should get going so she’s not alone.”
>Rox walks up to the guest book and signs both of your names, leaving one final goodbye message to the old beagle
>”Thanks for everything, Chobbo,” she says. “We’ll keep your secret little part of the park running, I promise.”

>Rox sure called it
>Poor Chee must have been in the park no more than 10 minutes before getting sent home with massive tears in her eyes
>You might have even passed her on the roads when you and Rox were heading IN to work
>Rox doesn’t even make it halfway into the apartment before the bird throws herself at the wolfess, sobbing wildly
>It’s Rox’s turn to be the supportive roommate, though you can tell she’s misting up a bit as well just from listening to the sheer grief of the bird
>The two girls spend the rest of the day hugging on the couch, with Rox only getting some freedom when she pries herself away to make dinner for everyone
>You’re her placeholder in the meantime, wrapped up in Chee’s wings as the oriole resumes crying into your shoulder
>It’s soul crushing to hear the bird like this, but all you can do is let her get it all out
>For once, this isn’t sadness coming from uncertainty of the future
>It’s not like before when you were all scared Rox would be fired or Chee would have to quit her job
>Someone important may have left your lives, but the rest of your family is still here to carry the weight
>”How about a movie?” Rox says
>She pops “Frostbitten” in and the sobs of the young bird are downgraded to gentle hiccups
>For all the times Chee’s seen her favorite Whimsey film, it still manages to work its magic on her
>And for reasons not entirely certain to you, even Rox hums along to the songs
>The three of you watch the movie together all huddled in one big embrace, and by the time the credits roll everyone’s ready for bed
>Chee looks exhausted from a day’s worth of crying, and Rox tucks her in before coming to join you
>”She’ll be fine,” the wolfess whispers, as though there were any doubt
>There’s just too much bubbly positivity in the bird to keep her down for too long
>The next day arrives with the uncomfortable reminder of what the previous one brought, but Chee seems much better after a good night’s sleep
>Though the gray clouds still hang overhead, most of the anthros in the park appear to have accepted Chobbo’s passing
>Many still have heavy hearts, but others have come to the understanding that their dear friend and idol would have wanted them to focus on what matters most: bringing happiness to others
>Unfortunately, the mood will get worse one more time before it can get better
>There’s still the meeting with Whimsey Jr.
>The entire conference hall over in the Cast Complex is packed with anthros late in the evening
>Only a few anthro employees remained at their stations to help close the park — those who never had much of a connection to the beagle, or those who are too stricken with emotional agony to face reality quite yet — but just about everyone else showed up for the occasion
>A squad of coordinators and upper management is lined up by the podium, waiting for the man himself to arrive
>For just how many bodies there are in the room — animalistic ones at that — it’s disturbingly quiet apart from a few scattered sniffles
>You can only imagine this must be how everyone else in the company reacted when D. Whimsey Sr. passed away all those years ago
>That may have been even worse, as the man touched the hearts of both humans AND anthros
>Whimsey Jr. finally arrives once all the seats have been filled, walking up to the podium as though approaching the gallows for his own execution
>He looks as though he aged at least ten years since you’ve last seen him, and the smile he always had with him is absent
>The only strength he has is in the hands strongly gripping the corners of the podium, and you suspect that’s only to keep them from visibly shaking in front of everyone
>”Thank you for joining me tonight, my friends,” he croaks, barely audible over the microphone
>His voice elicits a few hushed sobs from the audience
>It takes Mr. Whimsey another minute before proceeding
>”I haven’t asked you all here to go over what you’ve already been told. I trust the news has been thoroughly spread by now, and...frankly, I still don’t want to believe it myself. We’ve lost a dear friend, and he will be on our minds for the unforeseeable future as we prepare to give him the proper sendoff he deserves. For those interested in honoring him, I will keep you all abreast of what we have in mind.”
>Mr. Whimsey swallows so strongly you can the lump travel down his wrinkled throat
>”When my father adopted Chobbo as a pup, he told me I had a new brother. Growing up surrounded by Whimsey films, having a canine sibling wasn’t out of the ordinary to me. My father made the reality he wanted to see in his work, and that became my reality as well. I understood the gravity of having to keep my brother hidden from the rest of the company, and the world as well, but that never obstructed the love we shared with him. We were not ashamed of him; we merely wanted to protect what was most special to our family. As far as I’m concerned, my mother always had two sons: a slobbering, hairy troublemaker...and Chobbo.”
>A corner of Whimsey’s mouth is tugged up with a smirk as sparse chuckling comes from the audience
>His hands begin to shake and his cheeks quiver, but there’s conviction in his eyes
>”He’s laughing at me now, too,” Whimsey says. “I know it. Never failed to see the humor in a bad situation, whether it was at my expense or his own. If there’s any lesson to take away from this moment, it’s to always keep that attitude our father always carried with him. It’s not easy to force a smile or forgive someone for his or her anger, but it’s even harder to carry a bitterness that you don’t deserve to be burdened with. We’re all deserving of happiness. Every last one of us.”
>A haunting chill runs up your spine at his words, and you think back to the day you spent at the Cast Complex with Rox and Chee
>The day you watched the last recorded speech by D. Whimsey Sr.
>Old man Whimsey’s final words to the public are channeled into his son, and Whimsey Junior — for one brief moment — almost seems to take on the very aura of his father
>He looks from one face to another, giving everyone a personal look of respect and love
>”We’re all deserving,” Whimsey says again. “Make each day magical; not just for yourself, but everyone around you as well. I’m so, so proud of everything we’ve accomplished together; proud of all of you. No doubt many of you have already heard rumbles of what we have in store, and in a few short weeks we’ll be unveiling the next step in our mission to introduce all of you to the humans. We’ve already made wonderful strides in bringing one in to our world....”
>Mr. Whimsey hones in on where you’re sitting, and you can feel dozens of gazes follow him to you
>”...And I’d like to thank him for his patience and cooperation. I’d like to thank all of you for the same, as well. The changes we’ve made might have been frightening to some of you, but I’m pleased with how much we’ve grown in such a small amount of time. To see so many beautiful individuals from both worlds sharing the same space is something my father always dreamed of, and when the day comes I finally join my dear friend and brother...I hope all of you will carry that dream on as well in our place. Thank you all for joining me tonight, and I wish you...all the best.”
>There’s not a dry eye in the conference hall when Mr. Whimsey finishes his speech

>The Booze Cruise
>Everyone has the same idea after a day like this one
>You’ve never seen the bar this packed before
>Just finding a table was a challenge in and of itself, and you’ve managed to squeeze a group of five around one of the smallest in the place
>Joining you and your roommates are Sherry-K and Mionra
>Surprisingly, it didn’t take much convincing to get the tigress to come along this time
>Either she was looking forward to a therapeutic shot or two herself, or she’s finally coming out of her shell
>Having a cute vixen girlfriend like Mionra for moral support probably helps as well
>Everyone has someone to sit with tonight, whether they want to or not
>Even the bartender doesn’t want to be on the other side of the counter all by himself; Cookie the panda shovels pretzels into his mouth as a few other anthros pat him on the back reassuringly
>Down below on the human level, the crowd is thinner yet no more jovial
>It’s as though the dower mood of the anthros is seeping through the walls, making the barflies on the other side of the protective glass just as gloomy for reasons they don’t understand
>The only happy faces in the entire bar are the two in the framed picture high up on the wall: the faces belonging to the late Darwin Whimsey Senior and Chobbo in their most iconic moment together
>Some of the anthros stare at the picture with unbroken stillness, while others are deliberately averting their eyes so they don’t break down in tears yet again
>At your own table, Rox appears to be taking the situation better than the others, though she has a bit of a grumpy demeanor influenced by a bit of alcohol
>”This sucks,” she grumbles again for what feels like the dozenth time today. “He was supposed to be there for the new show....”
>”Roksa,” Sherry-K sighs. “Think of his family. Their mourning is what’s most important right now. This is a little more serious than a parent not showing up to a dance recital.”
>”He was part of our family as well,” Rox grumbles, throwing back her drink
>”Speaking of which,” the tigress continues, “I was instructed to remind you of the deadline regarding invitations for the debut performance. Is there anyone in your immediate family you would like to attend on opening night?”
>”I’ll get back to you on that,” Rox mutters, barely audible
>Even the way the two girls banter doesn’t have the same liveliness as usual
>Chee is the most heartbroken of the whole group, and for once she’s nearly keeping pace with Rox in terms of drinks
>This puts a worried look on Mionra’s muzzle, no doubt because the vixen has been Chee’s friend possibly just as long as Rox has
>Mionra digs into her purse and pulls out a brightly-striped bowtie, holding it out daintily in her paw for the bird
>”Chee,” Mionra says sweetly. “If it would make you feel better, would you like something of Chobbo’s for your collection?”
>The sad oriole looks as though Mionra just offered to bring the dog back from the dead, and her wings shake as she accepts the bowtie with awe
>”This...C-Chobbo’s...?” Chee whispers
>”Mmhmm, that’s right,” Mionra says. “Came across it when I was cleaning out my old place for the, ah, ‘move.’”
>She gives Sherry-K a wink, who tries her best to hide her proud grin
>”Anyway,” Mionra continues, “I’ve had it almost as long as I started working here. It was in my first week, and costuming had run out of uniforms for Ratty ol’ Mansion in my size. I had to use a larger one with a few missing buttons at the collar. Well, to make a long story short, I ran into Chobbo one day and he gave me his bowtie to hold my uniform together. I even offered to return it to him later, but he wouldn’t accept it. It was a little while before I realized just how important he was to the company, and once I did I made sure to keep the bowtie safe ever since. Kept it hidden away ever since.”
>”Heh, are you sure they didn’t make you stop wearing it because it wasn’t part of the ‘standardized employee dress code’?” Rox sneers
>Sherry-K turns up her nose dismissively, but Mionra pats her on the paw to cool the tigress down
>At least the banter is getting back to its usual level
>”T-thank you, Mionra,” Chee sniffs. “I’ll make sure to keep it just as safe as you did...for Chobbo!”
>Rox gives a glance to the portrait of Mr. Whimsey and Chobbo, then she holds up her glass
>”For Chobbo,” she repeats. “And to the new show. He’s got the best seats in the house now, so let’s give him something to be entertained by!” 
>Everyone else at the table grabs their glass and gives a toast to the beagle’s memory
>Several other nearby anthros join in as well, and a friendly warmth grows in the bar
>After everyone finishes their drinks, Sherry-K rises from the table and excuses herself to go to the little kittens’ room
>Once out of earshot, Rox leans in closer to Mionra
>”This might be bad timing considering the, erm, last day,” the wolfess says, “but I gotta say, Mio, you must be doing something right. Sher’s been looking a lot happier overall ever since you two got together.”
>”You really think so?” the vixen replies
>Chee nods her head confidently
>”I think so, too! You both seem like really close friends!”
>”Yeah, ‘friends’,” Rox snickers
>Mionra swirls the last few drops of her drink around her glass, scrunching her face up as she tries to find the right words
>”There’s something I should tell you...SHOULDN’T tell you, actually,” she says. “But...well, I think it’s important to say. Plus, I’ve never been too good with secrets, as I’m sure you both know.”
>You catch Rox’s golden eyes do a quick roll
>Mionra pauses for a while, but once she realizes she’s under a time limit she suddenly speaks in a much more hurried, yet still hushed tone
>”I think Sher is more positive now, too,” the vixen says. “Which is why I didn’t want to say anything before. Still, I think it’s important to let her closest friends know there was a time — pretty recently, actually — that she...well...was thinking of quitting her job here.”
>Chee opens her beak to cry out in surprise, but Rox manages to catch her in time
>That doesn’t stop the wolfess from looking just as shocked, however
>”W-what!?” Rox hisses
>Mionra waves her paws frantically, trying to calm the girls down so they don’t draw attention to the table
>”It’s as I said: I think she’s feeling better about it now, and I don’t believe she intends on leaving us anytime soon. But even so...the stress was really getting to her; you all know that, right? Once she started packing up and getting rid of a lot of her Whimsey things, I think she got ahead of herself. She was overdoing it, like she was just about ready to close the book on this place and throw her whole life here away. I had to beg her myself to reconsider.”
>Chee whimpers through her closed beak, and Rox exhales deeply
>”Damn, Mio,” the wolfess says. “Nice job. Glad you were there to talk her out of it.”
>”Well, truthfully...” the vixen says, “I think the thanks goes to you. All three of you.”
>Mionra’s eyes narrow and a wide smile stretches across her muzzle, giving her a very “happy trickster fox” sort of look you’ve seen before in Whimsey cartoons
>”Sher hasn’t stopped talking about the show ever since rehearsals started,” the vixen says. “She’s EXTREMELY excited about it, even if she doesn’t show it much around work. You’ve all given her something to look forward to each day, and I can’t wait to see her reaction to the big debut...maybe even more so than seeing the show itself! So if there’s anyone who can take the credit for making her want to stay in Whimsey World, it’s you guys.”
>The vixen reaches out and gives everyone — hand, paw, or wing — a gentle squeeze
>”And that’s all I need to get through the day myself. You’ve helped me meet a great tiger, and you’ve helped bring out the wonderful side of her little by little. I never thought we’d see her go from such a cold person to the fuzzy sister figure she’s become to us all. As long as we’re all here together, I wouldn’t want things any other way. Thank you, Rox...Chee...Anon...and good luck to all of you at Whimsical Knights!”
>Rox nods thoughtfully, but her face suddenly contorts to a more inquisitive expression
>”Haaang on, Mio,” she says. “What exactly does Chee have to do with the show, though?”
>The bird makes a muffled peep and the vixen clamps her own mouth shut
>Mionra wasn’t kidding about her loose lips
>The two of them just shake their heads nervously as Rox looks from one guilty face to the other
>Now those two poor girls have another reason to look forward to the show’s debut: no longer worrying about spoiling their secrets



[[ CHAPTER 39: Rox Band ]]

>Every day since Mr. Whimsey’s speech has felt like one big training montage, like in the movies
>Determined to put on the best show possible in honor of Chobbo’s memory, Rox dials up her effort in the performance rehearsals to a level you didn’t think was possible
>You’re exhausted by the end of the day just from watching her
>Which is doubly ironic, because it feels like you’ve used your own legs less and less recently as the wolfess carries you under her arm to and from work constantly
>Just like the old days
>Even on the weekend she tries to fit in a little bit of practice at the apartment, much to the chagrin of your mutual avian roommate
>Not only does Rox forbid Chee from watching, but the bird is basically held hostage in her own room while the wolfess runs through the motions
>You can hear Chee whining from her room frequently, as though she’s on the verge of exploding
>She quietly opens her bedroom door one evening, only to get a mouthful from Rox
>”Chee, I told you no spying!” the wolfess barks
>”Roxieee!” Chee cries. “I have to go to the bathroom!”
>”Fine, make it quick!”
>Chee sprints into the bathroom, shielding her eyes with her wings so she doesn’t accidentally peek at anything she shouldn’t
>Poor girl’s going to start molting from the secondhand stress...
>You do what you can to ease Rox’s nerves with the usual scratches and rubs, hoping she’ll stop taking her own anxiety out on the bird
>Her throat rumbles in pleasure against your fingertips as you dig into the scruff of her neck
>”Take your time in there, Chee,” Rox sighs. “We’re done for the day anyway.”
>You and Rox take a breather on the couch as you get the sweet spot behind her ears
>She only breaks out of her euphoric trance when Chee finally exits the bathroom, and the wolfess once again apologizes to her roommate for the outburst
>Thankfully, the young bird continues to be understanding and supportive
>”You just want to be ready, Roxie,” Chee says as the two girls hug it out. “I know you mean well. Once the big night is over, you’ll feel much better!”
>”Yeah, you’re right,” Rox mumbles. “But I’m going to make it up to you for acting like such a hothead, trust me. First day we’re all off together, we’re doing something fun to let loose.”
>”Great! Do you have something in mind...or is it another surprise?”
>Rox chuckles at Chee’s little pout when she says “surprise”
>”Nope, can’t spoil anything,” Rox says. “Sorry. I think you’re gonna like it, though! There’s a secret to the park I don’t think even YOU know about....”
>Chee blinks, taken aback by the comment
>”Wh...? No, that’s not possible!” she says. “I know the whole park inside and out!”
>Rox gives you a sly wink
>”Oh, believe me, Chee. There’s still a little piece of Whimsey World you haven’t discovered yet, courtesy of ol’ Chobbo. Been waiting for the right time to show you. We’ll even call it ‘Chee World’ just for you! Doesn’t that make you excited to find it?”
>”OOOoooooohhhaaaaaaRoxieeeeee! Why are you torturing meee?”
>Rox just laughs at the poor bird’s frustration, holding her tight and spinning her in circles
>For how much the two girls have grown since you met them, they still find a way to get under each other’s skin
>Or fur, or feathers...
>It’s the natural way of the life for these two, though, and something wouldn’t feel right if you never got caught in the middle of their squabbling anymore like when you were first brought into the anthro world
>Just like the old days

>The night has arrived at last
>The very first Whimsical Knights show since it reopened; the first show to kick off the next phase of the mascot initiative
>Any tension you’re feeling tonight has to be plaguing Rox tenfold
>She hasn’t slept since yesterday, nor does it seem like she’s blinked a single time
>You both changed into your costumes at the very start of your shift, but for the last couple of hours you’ve been waiting for the big moment
>Sitting backstage nervously until the second act comes
>The show hasn’t even begun yet, adding to the suspense with every passing minute
>From what you’ve been told, both the human and anthro sections of the audience have been completely filled tonight
>Members of the press and diehard Whimsey fans forced their way into the seats ahead of the regular guests, making this a particularly important crowd to have to impress for a debut performance
>Everyone knows something new was added to the show, but Whimsey management miraculously kept the surprise under wraps the entire time up until now
>You haven’t been this pressured (and concerned for your life) to keep a secret since your introduction to the anthro world
>You’ve been told countless times how much the anthros have learned to trust you and accept you, but with the whole world watching tonight you have a dreaded, familiar feeling that your every move is going to be scrutinized
>Their eyes are going to be on you probably more intensely than any of the actual performers, making sure you don’t try to pull anything brash or stupid
>Well, at least the ones who matter most to you wouldn’t dare question their trust in you
>You take Rox’s large paw in your hand, and her digits curl over your fingers reflexively
>She breaks out of her meditative silence to give you a thankful smile
>”The waiting’s killing me,” she groans softly
>It won’t be too long now before the show begins, but the anxiety will only build from the second it does
>Like moving from the waiting room to the doctor’s examining table; you’re getting closer to the end, but the worst still hasn’t started yet
>Is it Rox’s pulse you can feel in her paw pads, or is she giving you little rhythmic squeezes?
>Her breathing gets quicker but her eyes droop dreamily
>Not sleepiness or fatigue, but infatuation
>You are her trusted reserve of energy, encouragement, and security
>She opens her mouth — either to say something or maybe to swoop in for a quick kiss — only to be interrupted by someone clearing their throat
>”Need I remind you two of workplace dating and open displays of affection AGAIN?”
>Sherry-K, of course
>The tigress drums her claws on her clipboard and her tail swishes like a predator ready to pounce, but rather than a stern expression her lips have a crooked hint of coyness to them
>”W-what?” Rox scoffs. “You came all the way from your office to peep on us like a weirdo or something? This isn’t your side of the park!”
>”The entire park is ‘my side’, Roksa,” Sherry-K says. “I simply choose to patrol the parts I feel are most likely to suffer operations complications...or produce troublemakers.”
>”Ha, so you ARE stalking us, then,” Rox says, sticking her tongue out
>”Perhaps.”
>The tigress paces closer, glancing from Rox to you, back and forth
>She shakes her head and clicks her tongue, taking in both of your costumes but reserving her harshest judgment for the Rook-Woof outfit
>”No semblance of coordination or synergy with those colors,” Sherry-K says. “I’m impressed. I didn’t think they could invent a costume even louder than the person wearing them.”
>A few months ago you would have expected a fight to break out between the two, but the tigress’ catty remarks just makes Rox grin smugly
>Much like the Rox versus Chee fights, the banter between wolfess and tigress is as normal as things could get
>”You always know the right thing to say, Sher,” Rox says. “Is your plan to keep us distracted until we hit the stage, so we aren’t sitting here sweating it the whole time?”
>”Absolutely not,” Sherry-K says. “After all, the Roksa I know would never be fretting something like this. Not even after callously dragging a human into our organization, I remind you.”
>”Heh, I might not be scared when you write me up for something, but I still have my limits,” Rox says. “I think you’re giving me too much credit.”
>”How many times must I repeat myself?” Sherry-K says firmly. “I mean everything I say with the utmost sincerity. You may not appreciate it when I lecture or punish you, but I will always give out my honest feedback whenever possible. I won’t hand out praises unless I genuinely mean them, and I’ve known you far too long to be convinced a little stage fright will stop you from leaping out there with overabundant confidence...and doing something I’ll surely have to reprimand you for later.”
>”Aww, Sher...” Rox says. “That’s so touching...I think.”
>Sherry-K’s grassy eyes meet your own, and sure enough there’s sincerity in the tigress’ eyes not unlike the night she spilled her soul to you in her apartment
>Sincerity AND respect
>”You deserve similar praise, Anon,” the tigress says. “Of course we’ve given our gratitude numerous times regarding your confidentiality and patience during this whole...transition. That we cannot stress enough. However, more attention should be given to what you’ve done to help our company...our family...and each of us individually. I don’t believe I need to explain the ways you’ve helped our friends and coworkers during your employment here, but I would like to thank you for all of it. Not since D. Whimsey Jr. himself have I ever met a more admirable human.”
>If you and Rox weren’t practically joined at the hip at all times — and Sherry-K could pry you away privately for just a moment — she would no doubt be much more candid about what she really means
>Rox may have discovered how Sherry-K truly feels about her, but the moment of weakness the tigress confided in you that night at her place remains between you and her alone
>She knows that nobody else knows, and so for the first time since that fateful night you can clearly see the respect Sherry-K has for you
>It’s not easy blabbing about a society of animal people to the whole world, but it can be even harder to keep a juicy, potentially damaging bit of workplace gossip under your hat for so long
>You have the assurance that you’re finally on Sherry-K’s best possible side
>...At least as long as she’s in the best possible mood
>There is so much fuzzy warmth in the room that a swell of music echoes around you, first figuratively, and then literally
>Rox inhales sharply at the music, bracing herself for the start of Whimsical Knights
>It’s time
>In just a few seconds, you’ll hear the booming voice of the announcer welcoming all the guests to the show and hyping them up for what’s in store
>A voice that has meant relatively little to you in the past, yet now has a LOT more significance
>But that particular voice never comes
>{“Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls!”}
>It’s not the deep tone of a male’s voice, but the airy, singsong pitch of a female’s
>A voice you know all too well
>Rox’s mouth swings open, like someone just stepped on her tail
>”CHEE?” she sputters. “When did she...!?”
>”You’re surprised?” Sherry-K says. “Chee was promoted to Senior Supervisor of Park Operations for good reason. She has the energy and the love for the Whimsey brand that is virtually unmatched by anyone within the company. When management was brainstorming how to revitalize other aspects of the show aside from just the second act, they turned to Chee and asked to record her voice for the entire Whimsical Knights narration. Needless to say, she was eager to accept the role. Hmm, I would have assumed you two of all people would have been the first ones to hear the news.”
>”Thatta’ girl!” Rox says, ignoring the tigress’ snark. “No wonder she wanted to keep that a secret!”
>Even with the Whimsical Knights spiel already engrained into your mind, it sounds fresh and captivating when delivered by the cheerful bird
>You don’t doubt that Chee would easily voice each night’s performance herself if given the chance, rather than just use a recording
>”So, now that she’s officially part of the show, is she getting one of the front row seats to check it out?” Rox says
>Sherry-K shakes her head amusedly
>”Always devoted to her work, that one. Chee has unfortunately declined the offer. She will be continuing her shift at Little Happy Planet as usual. However, I’m certain she will be keeping at least ONE of the backstage monitors tuned in to the performance. D. Whimsey Jr. has decided to do a live broadcast of tonight’s performance; it will be available for public viewing on The Whimsey Channel so that everyone can experience the reveal together.”
>Humans and anthros across the world will get to see it, then
>That’s an extra layer of pressure you didn’t really need right now
>That doesn’t seem to bother Rox, but something else is on her mind
>”Speaking of audiences...” she begins hesitantly
>Sherry-K nods knowingly, relieving the wolfess having to ask the question herself
>”Both of your invitees are in attendance. I believe they have already been shown their seats. Separate, as you requested.”
>”Great, thanks,” Rox mutters
>If there’s any saving grace to having Rox’s parents in the audience, it’s that at least there’s a one-way mirror that the anthros are watching from behind
>It’ll help keep Rox’s mind off of her mom and dad if she can’t actually see them once she’s up on stage
>You listen to Chee set the scene for the opening act for a while, until you’re joined by the remaining two performers of your team
>The Blue Suede Bear and Lulu-by the Orangutan look pretty nervous themselves, but their smiles keep them standing strong
>”How you holdin’ up, hon?” Lulu says to Rox
>”Just peachy,” Rox swallows
>”If you got the jitters, just let them carry your feet,” Blue rumbles, tapping his toes. “Works for me every new show. Don’t you worry, little missy. It’ll only get easier from here, uh-huh.”
>”I’ll keep that in mind, thanks.”
>You share a group huddle with the Whimsical Knights
>Everyone has their own role to carry out and their own cues to follow, but it’s a team effort to succeed
>That’s a lesson you were taught back when you first starting working at Whimsey World; no matter how badly the day beats you down, you’re at least sharing the misery with a bunch of people who know exactly what you’re going through 
>Sherry-K gives you time to enjoy the comradery of the Whimsical Knights, but as the first act rapidly approaches its conclusion the tigress hovers close by
>”If you wouldn’t mind, please take your positions,” she says
>You and the three anthros stand on the stage lifts, and the roof above your heads slowly opens up
>A smoky mist drifts down from outside, creating an obscuring haze for you to enter through
>The platform beneath you rumbles, then lifts you toward the stage above
>”Good luck, all of you,” Sherry-K says, while the other show coordinators salute and cheer you on
>You give Rox a look of encouragement before the smoke engulfs her completely
>The next time you see her, she’ll be Rokk-Woof for real
>The music is in the lull between tracks and the crowd is quiet in anticipation, making the ascent a very surreal, still feeling
>The mist is cool against what little of your skin shows through the costume, giving you a brief, chilling refreshment before you are thrust into the balmy night air
>Showtime

>{“Our heroes will need some extra support to beat those nasty villains! Luckily, help is on the way to give them a boost of confidence!”}
>Chee’s voice echoes through the park as the audience continues to hold their breath
>The stage lights are off, but you can see all the little trinkets and souvenirs of the guests glowing throughout the audience like multicolored fireflies
>Glow sticks, light bracelets, and the occasional camera blink hastily made before the guest is reminded not to use flash photography
>You don’t need to see the whole crowd to know just how massively packed the theater is
>Like a wall of humans that blocks sight of the rest of the park
>The Whimsical Knights theater is the biggest one on Whimsey Grounds, and you’ve never seen so many guests concentrated in one spot
>And somewhere beneath them, even more are watching
>You can picture all the species of anthros on the edge of their seats, praying the show will go off without a hitch just as much as they are hoping to get an entertaining performance from the second act
>Again, you’re really thankful for the one-way mirror hiding them from your vision
>A powerful gust from a wind machine blows away the mist, and each of the three anthros are illuminated with a powerful spotlight
>That’s when you spring into action
>The crowd applauds in excitement as you hop down from your platform to assist the other Fan-Ons, each one a unique neon color and style
>You slide chunks of the new stage together and sweep debris from the last act away, turning the set into an entirely different landscape in seconds
>One by one, the anthros come to life
>First Rox, striking a few electric poses and strumming away at an air guitar
>Then Lulu, blowing a few shrill notes on her saxophone
>And finally Blue, rocking his hips like he’s trying to keep an invisible hula-hoop going
>The applause from the crowd quickly dies down and is replaced by gasps of surprise and awe
>You can instantly read the expressions on their faces; many of them clearly thinking things such as, “They look so lifelike!” and “How are they doing that?”
>Meanwhile, you look from one anthro performer to another and try to imagine them just being some human in an elaborate character suit, hoping the illusion hasn’t already been broken
>You can see why the guests are so impressed: it’s pretty difficult to tell yourself these two-legged animal people aren’t real
>You’ve been living with them for a few months now, but it’s almost as if you’re seeing them for the first time
>Technically, you are
>Rox is finally performing amongst the humans, no longer confined to her bulky mascot suit
>She still can’t move her mouth or swing her tail too much, but it’s really her out here — fur and all
>Each of the anthros gets their own time to shine, complete with a musical leitmotif composed in the style of their outfit
>Rokk-Woof starts the rotation off with a rock ballad for the ages, jamming out to everything from classic to techno with amazing speed and footwork
>She moves from one end of the set to the other with staggering speed, jumping at the crash of cymbals and sliding with the riffs of guitars
>She was born to play this role
>There’s a hint of her old Whirly Barf routine in her motions, but everything else seems tailored specifically to her new persona
>The other Fan-Ons are scattered all over the stage, hanging around like the Rokk-Woof groupies they are but luckily instructed not to get too close to their “idol”
>You’re the only one she approaches directly, slapping your hand each time she passes by
>The nerves are all gone, and she’s completely in her element
>Rox parades around with such confidence and grace you nearly forget it’s the wolfess you’ve fallen in love with
>With a spin and a flip, she makes one last pose before the final cords of her solo reverberate through the stage
>It’s enough to earn her another round of applause, and you join in with the audience
>The music transitions to a smoother, jazzy melody as Lulu takes center stage with her instrument, but Rox isn’t finished showing off just yet
>She’s staring directly at you, then points to a spot right beside you
>You look over your shoulder to see a young human girl leaning against the front-row guardrail with her mouth agape and her eyes filled with wonder
>When you glance back to Rox, the wolfess nods firmly
>Her part in the performance is done for now; she doesn’t have to do anything else except wait for Blue to wrap things up
>She SHOULDN’T be doing anything else, really
>You know what she wants to do, and what she wants to do isn’t in the script
>Nor do you think she could get away with it
>But something inside compels you to follow her lead, and before you know it you’re returning her nod
>You face the young girl and offer your hand
>To the girl and her parents, this is just part of the show
>The small human child doesn’t hesitate to grab your hand, and she hops up and down as you lead her from the audience seating up the steps to the stage where Rokk-Woof is kneeling in wait
>Just as Rox whisked you away that unforgettable evening into the world of the anthros, now it’s your turn
>You guide the girl up to the wolfess silently
>The two are frozen in place for what feels like forever
>Neither one blinking or saying a word
>At last, Rox takes the first move, reaching out and tussling the young girl’s hair
>She pats the girl on the back gently and then bops her lightly on the nose, and the girl’s eyes manage to get even wider
>This is probably what Chee would look like as a human child, with her mouth open and her eyes sparkling with fantasy
>The two finish their interaction with a high-five, and Rox lets you take the girl by the hand again to return to her seat
>Now you’re the one the little girl is looking at with those saucer-plate eyes
>”Is she...real?” the little girl says breathlessly
>What do you say?
>A long time ago at Whimsey Orientation — what feels like another lifetime by now — you were taught the rules and philosophies of the company, set in stone and passed down from D. Whimsey Sr. himself
>There was one in particular that management always stressed above any other: the magic is always real
>Everything you see in Whimsey World is genuine, and the moment you step past the main gates the only barrier remaining is your own imagination
>You just aren’t instructed to act out your role, you’re encouraged to live it and believe it
>Whirly Barf is a real character
>Starlight Summit is a real place
>And every automatic door in the park is really the spirit of D. Whimsey himself, personally ushering you through the threshold with promise of adventure and priceless memories
>So when this little girl asks you if the anthropomorphic wolf in the rocker costume she just met is a real creature, what choice do you have?
>It’s in your very job description to tell her the honest truth
>You give the girl a discreet nod, hoping you don’t suddenly have crosshairs lined up on your head from someone hidden in the shadows
>But disbelief is perhaps Whimsey World’s biggest defense for the anthros, and nobody the little girl tells is going to believe her when she enthusiastically tries to tell them Rokk-Woof is real
>It’s a little sad, but maybe she’ll hang on to this moment until the day she’ll finally get to discover the truth
>Maybe you’ve even created a future Whimsey employee, one who will return someday looking for anthros the same way anthros like Rox came here looking for humans to meet
>The girl’s parents are fervently snapping pictures on their cameras as you guide her back to her seat, trying to immortalize the beaming smile she has
>Surprisingly, she doesn’t immediately blurt out about meeting a real anthropomorphic wolf
>Maybe she’ll keep it as her own secret after all?
>Well, as long as you don’t hear about this from an enraged Sherry-K the second you’re backstage...
>And at least you won’t be alone in your deed, either
>Following Rox’s lead, Blue had his own encounter with a young audience member while Lulu played her Saxophone solo, and once it’s time for the bear’s opportunity in the spotlight — gyrating around the stage to some old, funky rock — the orangutan takes her own turn greeting some guests
>The audience loves it just as much as the children do, but none of them are enjoying this moment quite like the anthros are
>You can tell they’re trying their hardest to remain stoic and keep up the facade of wearing masks, but the sheer rapture they’re overcome with gives away some subtle clues in their faces
>The second act flies by before you know it, and soon you’re joining Rokk-Woof on her platform
>She claps you on the shoulder and you all wave goodbyes to the crowd, right before the four of you disappear into the mists again and descend underground
>Not even the fireworks finale gets as much applause as the Whimsical Knights are getting right now

>The cheers continue on as you’re lowered backstage, and you’re quickly surrounded by coordinators and anthro employees waiting to celebrate the overwhelming success
>Though the anthro characters get more (admittedly deserved) credit than just the green human Fan-On, both Blue and Lulu grab hold of you in joy as they’re caught up with emotion
>”Oh, I feel so young again!” Lulu says, flicking away a drop of moisture from her eye
>”I hear you, pretty mama,” Blue sniffs. “Never thought this old bear would ever get that kind of love again.”
>There isn’t much room for Rox to squeeze in, but she’s already looking out for someone else to celebrate with
>The wolfess darts through the cluster of coordinators toward Sherry-K
>The tigress casually flings her clipboard away and braces for the hug that Rox tackles her with
>”You were incredible out there, Roksa,” Sherry-K says proudly
>”Thanks, Sher,” Rox says, tail wagging. “And thanks for believing in me... for giving Anon and me this chance. We wouldn’t be here without you!”
>Knowing Rox, she’s talking more about the bigger picture than just Sherry-K vouching for her for the mascot initiative
>The bear and orangutan release you long enough for you to get closer to the hugging girls, and you can just barely hear Rox mutter in Sherry-K’s ear
>”I hope you never leave us, Sher,” Rox says. “This place just wouldn’t be the same without you.”
>A brief look of guilt washes over the tigress’ face, but with a defeated sigh she quickly breaks into a grin
>”I don’t plan on abandoning this place anytime soon, Roksa,” Sherry-K says. “You have my word.”
>Before you can get much closer to the two, a shrill squeal draws your attention
>It’s Chee, hopping madly toward you and looking as though she’s trying to take flight
>She actually gets a fair bit of altitude as the bird dives at you, taking you under her wing as you join Rox and Sherry-K in the group embrace
>”You guys were UNBELIEVABLE!” Chee trills. “Amazing! Best Whimsical Knights ever! I’m so proud of you!”
>”Hey, I thought you’re supposed to be running Little Happy Planet right now?” Rox laughs
>The bird ignores her joke and continues to sing praises
>”Best part of the show! Better than the fireworks! Oooh, I can’t wait until we start selling the new merchandise!”
>”You did pretty good yourself with the voice recording, Chee,” Sherry-K says. “It’s definitely a fresh, welcome change compared to the outdated narration Whimsical Knights has had in the past. You have the perfect voice for the job.”
>”You don’t live with her, Sher,” Rox says. “Let’s wait a few months and we’ll see if you feel the same way.”
>Chee sticks her tongue out and Rox pulls her in tighter
>”Sorry, Chee. Couldn’t help it!”
>”Always skating on thin ice, Roksa,” Sherry-K scoffs. “I hope you realize the kind of paperwork I’m going to have to do tonight to clear that little stunt you pulled with upper management.”
>”Sorry, Sher....”
> Rox isn’t dragging you into the flames for this one, but she’s still your partner in crime
>And your ride home as well, so you’ll be sticking with her for whatever punishment she’ll have to endure before the end of the night
>But it doesn’t look as though Sherry-K has reprimands on the mind this time
>”Given how quickly you’ve won over Mr. Whimsey, I’m sure he won’t mind a little...creative alteration to his show,” the tigress muses. “Don’t worry about it, Roksa. Go and enjoy the rest of your night. I think you’ve earned it.”
>Rox shakes her head
>”Thanks, but I’ll be sticking around for a little while longer anyway,” the wolfess says. “I’m sure the folks are going to want to say ‘hi’ once the show’s done.”
>Can’t say you’re exactly looking forward to seeing her mom again, but Rox doesn’t look too worried about it
>She just grabs you around the shoulder and gives a thumbs-up to Chee
>”If you beat us home, don’t wait up for us,” Rox says. “We’ll all go out and celebrate the right way tomorrow evening. I think Anon and I are going to be turning in early tonight once we get back.”
>With how bad Rox is at lying, it’s a miracle none of the others pick up on the suspicious way she says “early”
>And not even her domino mask can hide the dreamy, lustful look she has in her golden eyes
>She has something in mind for the two of you tonight, and as the adrenaline from the show slowly drains from your body it’s replaced with new anticipation for what she has in store
>You might be celebrating “the right way” tomorrow, but it looks like you’re going to be celebrating with Rox HER way tonight
>Provided you don’t have to carry her unconscious body into the apartment again, that is



[[ CHAPTER 40: King of Rox ]]

>Whimsical Knights still has one final act to go, but for most of the anthros the show is already over for the night
>Only a couple of anthro employees have a part in the finale, and those are the ones still stuck in the traditional full-body mascot costumes
>The Whimsey Corporation doesn’t like to shake up its classic shows TOO much — as many hardcore guests absolutely hate drastic changes to their nostalgia — but after the excitement the second act generated tonight, management might want to spice up the third act a little bit as well to keep the audience invested
>Not even the fireworks can top “lifelike” anthropomorphic animal people
>Still, it’s the first time getting a chance to see Whimsical Knights in its entirety for many of the anthros sitting in attendance, so you and Rox have to wait until the very end before getting the chance to see her parents
>Several anthro journalists try to sneak in a few words with the performers, but the Whimsey coordinators are quick to block them off until friends and family of the cast have the first chance
>Your group is given privacy away from where the Whimsical Knights audience slowly spills out of, and friends of the performers are sent in your direction
>A pair of young bear cubs dash over to be scooped up in each of Blue’s massive arms, while an old gentleman orangutan hobbles over on a cane to have a sweet moment with his wife Lulu
>You can’t ask for bigger fans than family
>For better or worse, the first of the two wolves to approach you and Rox is the one you were much more inclined to see
>Rox’s father walks up in a rather dressy suit and with his arms stretched out wide
>You try to step out of the way to let the two wolves share their hug, but Kale pulls you in before you can get far
>You’re crushed between the two wolves, surrounded by fur on all sides
>”What a show!” the elder wolf hollers. “That was amazing, sweetheart! And Anon, my boy, you made that little human girl so happy! I was so proud of both of you I was clinging to the poor guy next to me with tears in my eyes!”
>”Thanks for coming all this way, dad,” Rox says. “Glad you could make it.”
>”Wouldn’t miss it for the world, kiddo,” Kale says. “That was quite the surprise you kept. What a promotion, indeed!”
>The elder wolf glances around the backstage area with a nostalgic look in his eyes
>”Ahh...I almost forgot how neat this place is. Someday, when your old man retires, I’ll have to move to this side of town. Who knows, maybe I’ll even get a part-time job working here in the park? That way I can embarrass my little girl and my son-in-law like this every day. Bwahahaha!”
>”Daaad...” Rox grumbles
>Knowing where Rox gets her sense of humor from, Kale could be a good fit over at Gallery Guffaw, telling corny dad jokes each show
>Or maybe even take up his daughter’s legacy and don the Whirly Barf costume
>The three of you hug it out for a few more moments before the elder wolf gives you and Rox a few last affectionate pats on the back
>”Keep me in the loop, alright?” Kale says. “I’d love to see whatever new things you two are up to.”
>Kale gives you a firm nod; you’re unmistakably one of the family
>”I’ll keep coming back whenever you ask...just as long as the ticket’s free. This place hasn’t gotten any cheaper over the years! Bwahahaha!”
>”I’m sure we can work something out, dad,” Rox chuckles
>Kale’s raucous laugh continues as he walks off to head home, drawing the surprised stares of more than a few anthros
>Once his voice trails off into silence, a feeling of dread is left behind
>Now comes the rougher part
>The spitting image of Rox as an older wolf slowly pads up next
>Much like Kale, the mother wolf is dressed elegantly for the occasion
>Quite the stark contrast to her daughter, who looks like she was just ripped out of a 90s comic book
>But unlike the previous family interaction from moments ago, nobody is smiling
>Lelea looks from her daughter to you, not exactly sure whose crazy outfit she should be focusing on, yet at least making more eye contact with you than she did on your first meeting
>”Roks...ah, Rox,” she says, catching herself quickly. “Anon....”
>”Mom...” Rox replies flatly. “Thanks for coming tonight.”
>”You did really well tonight, sweetheart,” Lelea says. “Erm, both of you. You did good as well, Anon.”
>The mother wolf tries her best to be cordial with you, looking like a timid dog that would run off if you try to pet it
>There’s an awkward, extended pause
>The silence is killing you, and you realize it’s Rox who’s waiting for her mother to make the next move
>Whether they’re communicating through subtle “wolf signs” or they already had a private conversation earlier, Rox knows Lelea has something she’s supposed to say now
>The mother wolf inhales deeply, then keeps her gaze fixed on yours
>You still hope Rox ages just as gracefully as her mother
>”Anon, I...would like to apologize to you,” Lelea says. “We didn’t exactly start off on the right foot, and...that was entirely my fault. I was ignorant and a poor host, and I understand why you and Rox would be upset with me.”
>She holds out her perfectly manicured paw
>”It’s clear you make my Rox happy, and that’s a side of her I haven’t gotten the chance to see in years. I want to be in her life again to share that happiness, but I only made things worse. If you’re the one who can bring that side of her out, then I want to support you. I don’t expect your forgiveness, but I hope you can accept my apology. I’m sorry for how I’ve treated you.”
>Her words are careful and deliberate — perhaps to avoid any speciesist missteps — but they’re still honest
>She’s not just reciting a practiced, insincere speech to save face, and you can see the genuine hurt in her eyes from the bitter memory of how she treated you
>It will no doubt take a while for her to truly see you the same way she would if you were a wolf, but as Rox has said before, that’s her problem
>You’ll continue to love Rox with or without her mother’s blessing, and even if it takes years to win the elder wolf over you’ll still love Rox the entire time anyway
>You take Lelea’s paw and give it a firm shake
>Her grip, while not as strong as Kale’s, is at least friendlier than the first handshake you had with her
>Little steps
>It’s enough to bring a grin to Rox’s muzzle
>”Thanks, mom,” she says. “Hope you had a good time tonight.”
>”I have to say, it was a very impressive performance,” Lelea says. “I only wish it were a little longer.”
>Rox snorts; something else is clearly on her mind
>Something she’s waiting for as soon as the night is over
>The two wolves make some small talk for a little while before Lelea parts ways as well
>She even gives you a polite goodbye, which is as much of a relief as it is a compliment
>With familial obligations finished, a few of the anthro journalists are allowed to approach the performers in controlled numbers
>Many of them predictably swarm Rox and the others, but you get a couple of eager interviewers looking to get “a human perspective” on the show
>Granted, they make it sound like you were in the audience watching instead of actually BEING on the stage yourself, but whatever
>A few questions, a few photos, and soon Rox has had all she can take for the night
>Whatever she has in store for you, it’s becoming rapidly more difficult for her to hold it off

>It’s an eerie shift to have the whirlwind of activity and attention so suddenly stop
>You weren’t necessarily expecting to become a big celebrity constantly bombarded with followers once the show ended, but the world seems to much quieter than usual after coming down from the highs of the performance
>You and Rox get back to the apartment later than usual, and it looks like Chee took the wolfess’ advice to heart
>The bird is already in her room for the night, making the silence of the apartment even more apparent
>”Bet all the excitement tired her out,” Rox whispers as the two of you sneak through the living room. “Can’t say I blame her. I’d be dead on the couch already if I hadn’t slammed a coffee a little while ago.”
>You balk at her confession
>Caffeine THIS late at night?
>But the wolfess doesn’t say anything more as she leads you to the bedroom for the night
>You crash on the bed as she slips into the bathroom, and it takes a great deal of energy just to keep your eyes open
>The bed feels like the embrace of a long-lost friend after everything you’ve gone through today
>It’s still just barely big enough to contain both you AND Rox, and it’ll probably be a while before your promotions bring in enough money to pay for some nicer furniture
>Rox will probably want a more private place for the two of you as well, but not before she makes sure Chee has someone to keep her company, too
>Little steps
>The tug of fatigue almost makes you shut your eyes, when you’re suddenly jolted awake by a sharp clearing of the throat
>Rox is standing in the doorway of the bedroom, wearing the domino mask from her Rokk-Woof outfit
>And nothing else
>The gloriousness of her nude body is almost overshadowed by your surprise that she managed to sneak a piece of her costume off of Whimsey grounds
>Rox brings a finger to her lips
>”I won’t tell if you don’t. ”
>The wolfess tiptoes over to the bed, creeping closer like a predator on the prowl
>You suddenly realize just how spent your body feels, making you even more vulnerable to her advances
>”Just take it easy, champ,” Rox purrs. “Let me do the work tonight.”
>You laugh and ask if she intends on keeping the mask on, and Rox just cocks an eyebrow innocently
>”Rox? Doesn’t sound familiar. It’s just Rokk-Woof tonight, here to make her number-one fan’s dream come true.”
>Memories of your clumsy “first time” with Rox come racing back, including her admission that wearing a costume would probably have helped her overcome her anxiety about having sex with you
>You can only laugh again
>Guess she wasn’t kidding after all
>At least she isn’t wearing the Whirly Barf mask like she joked about
>Rox’s claws dig into your clothes, and she disrobes you with impressive quickness and gentleness
>Someone’s been practicing, for sure
>”Truth be told, I got it all backwards,” she says, keeping her voice low to a seductive rumble. “I’m here because I want you to make MY dreams come true. Rokk-Woof might get top billing in the duo, but she couldn’t do it without her Fan-On.”
>Now you’re completely in the buff as well, but the heat coming off of Rox’s body protects you from the chill of nudity
>The wolfess dips her head down and nibbles on your neck and shoulders, giving little love bites as her body presses down on your own
>”You don’t get nearly enough credit for what you do around here,” Rox says between nips on your skin. “They might treat you like an extra in the show, but you’re the most important thing in MY life. I wouldn’t be where I am without you, Anon.”
>She moves her hips up closer, and your growing arousal brushes against her toned belly
>The sudden stimulation makes you gasp, and Rox takes the opportunity to lock her lips with yours
>Her tongue darts around inside your mouth, while her paws rub and knead your skin to massage your muscles
>Your length is teased by the fur of Rox’s stomach, while she shifts her hips and grinds her heated folds against your legs one at a time
>The wolfess continues massaging your body after she disconnects the kiss, nibbling at your lower lip a few more times
>Taking control of the situation is out of the question with her weight keeping you pinned down and your muscles turning to putty in her leathery paw pads
>”Just relax for a bit,” Rox whispers when you try to shift around. “I know I have a habit of, well, getting the better deal when we mess around. Tonight’s just for you, Anon. Like I said, you don’t get rewarded nearly as well as you should. I want to make that up to you, starting...right...now....”
>She lifts her hips up and your tip slides down her belly, flicking against her own arousal as she hovers over you
>”Just gotta keep the wild noises down, alright?” the wolfess breathes, running a digit of her paw over your lips
>You nod slowly, and each bob of your head brings the lupine down bit by bit like a jack
>The scandalousness of trying to keep your actions quiet from your roommate pumps more adrenaline through you, and by the time Rox’s hips settle against yours you’re already feeling the countdown commence
>Rox’s tongue flops out of her mouth in pleasure as she wiggles down, followed by some heavy gyrating
>Combined with her costume mask, the whole image of her goofy look makes you let out a chuckle
>”Hey!” she growls quietly. “Knock it off. I’m doing this for YOU!”
>It’s playful banter, though even Rox seems to realize how ridiculous she must look right now
>But if this is how she shows her love for you, then you’ll take whatever she wants to give
>She plugs your mouth with her muzzle again, and the intimacy resumes
>The wolfess drains you dry late into the night, taking only brief pauses to listen for the stirring of your avian roommate



>[[ Some time later... ]]

>When was the last time Rox got frustrated at work?
>There was a time you’d be sharing your daily grievances with each other at the end of a long shift dealing with annoying park guests
>It doesn’t sound like the worst types of guests have gone away or gotten any more tolerable — if your coworkers’ rants are any indication — but you and Rox almost never have to interact with them
>It almost makes you feel guilty
>Almost
>As a matter of fact, these days the two of you get to hang out with the most adoring fans possible
>Tonight is one such example: Cast Night with the anthro kids
>After some careful planning by Whimsey management, a decision was made to extend the timeframe of Cast Nights and allow a larger crowd of (anthro) guests into the park once all the humans have gone home for the day
>Darwin Whimsey Senior dreamt of a world where humans and anthros could share the same space and live in harmony, and while such a day is still far off in the future it seems like a logical step to allow the Children of Aesop to enjoy the park they’ve helped him build
>Cast Nights used to be times when a scattered attendance of Whimsey-employed anthros would prowl the park grounds to enjoy a few short hours of entertainment, but now the streets are filled with crowds that almost rival the lowest, out-of-season numbers of human guests
>Humans in the day, and anthros at night
>The change is sudden and kind of magical, and you’ve grown to prefer the later hours of the day so you can see all the excited faces of the anthros who have never gotten the opportunity to see the fabled Whimsey World in their whole lives
>But on these kinds of nights, you’re often still on the clock
>You and Rox are dressed up as Fan-On and Rokk-Woof, following one of your Whimsical Knights performances
>And you’re not alone either; it’s your joint duty to remain in character as you accompany a small group of anthro children around the park and go on whatever rides they want with them
>A handful of pups, kits, and chicks buzz around you, thrilled to get the chance to meet their heroes (and stay up past their usual bedtime, of course)
>One poor otter girl only had so much energy for the day and is currently being carried in Rox’s arms as your group strolls through the park
>The wolfess doesn’t look the least bit bothered, however
>She actually has a warm, rather motherly sort of grin as the otter girl naps over her shoulder
>Meanwhile, your hands are nearly as full
>You’ve been holding the paw of a young lion cub for the last hour, making sure he doesn’t trip over his own furry feet since his gaze has been locked on you the entire time
>Cradled under his other arm is a Fan-On action figure, the same green-faced one modeled after the very character designed in your likeness
>The lion cub is positively awestruck at getting the chance to be so close to you
>Rokk-Woof and the other anthro Whimsical Knights still have the biggest following, but more than a couple fans seem to find you the coolest one of the bunch
>They’re probably too young to really understand the significance of who you really are and what role you’ve played in the human-anthro relations of Whimsey World and beyond, but that’s not what’s important right now
>You’re a superhero to them, and the thought that some of them want to come to Whimsey World just to see you is an incredible feeling
>As the night goes by, eventually you have to turn the anthro kids over to their parents
>The otter girl is sound asleep as her mother takes her off of Rox’s shoulder
>For one brief moment, you can sense some reluctance in Rox’s face to hand over the child as the little otter is transferred out of her arms
>With nothing left to hold, Rox’s arms hang limply at her sides
>There’s one last thing the wolfess could possibly want in her life to make all her dreams complete, and it’s arguably the most difficult one to fulfill
>Maybe impossible, even
>Rarely do people get EVERYTHING they want in life, even in a place like Whimsey World
>But Rox has gotten pretty close already, and you know she’s fine having something left to work toward
>The anthro kids say their sleepy goodbyes as their parents lead them to the park gates, and you and Rox are left on your own
>The masked wolfess stands in contemplation for a minute, but then turns to you with a spark of life you’ve been waiting to see all night
>”So, how about we check in on our dear friend?” she says, rubbing her paws together. “We gotta kill some time before my ‘surprise’ is ready.”
>Again with the surprises
>Rox has been looking forward to this night for the last week, but she hasn’t told you why
>She grabs your hand and the two of you dash off toward Little Happy Planet
>It’s still not one of the more popular rides, even for the anthros, but you know you’ll always find a welcoming smile running the attraction behind the scenes
>You slip into the backstage of the ride and make your way up to the control station, where a chipper oriole is organizing her collection of Whimsical Knights
>”Oh! Hello there, Rokk-Woof! Fan-On!” Chee says with a giggle. “Are you finished with the little ones for the night?”
>”Just dropped them off,” Rox says. “How have things been for you tonight, Chee?”
>”Quiet, as usual,” Chee says, shrugging her shoulders. “But at least I have some friends to keep me company!”
>The bird motions to her little Whimsical Knights figures
>She’s got a whole set for home, work, and even her car
>Everything Rox gets for free goes directly to Chee, but evidentially that wasn’t enough to satisfy the bird’s ever-growing collection
>Rox opens her mouth to chastise the bird, but she freezes when something on one of the attraction monitors catches her eye
>”Heh, speaking of friends....”
>Floating along the ride on one of the boats are Sherry-K and Mionra
>Wearing matching Whimsey shirts and leaning against each other intimately, paws interlocked
>The tigress and vixen are completely ignoring the attraction; instead they’re nuzzling each other and whispering inaudible things that you can only assume are heartfelt confessions
>The shorter vixen’s head is nestled in the neck of the larger tigress, though Mionra’s tail is bushy enough to fit on both of their laps
>It’s wondrous to see Sherry-K in one of her rare “out of work uniform” moments, but the blissful expression on her face is even more priceless
>She’s earned it
>Chee coos sweetly, then reaches ominously toward a button on the control counter
>Her wing is intercepted by Rox’s swift paw
>”Chee...” Rox scolds. “I don’t think so. Remember what happened the LAST time you took someone’s picture without their consent?”
>”Ooohhh, but they look so cute together!” Chee pouts. “Besides, everything worked out in the end anyway for you and Anon, didn’t it?”
>Rox turns to you, beaming proudly
>”Yeah...I guess you’re right. But still, you’re on your own if you try to pull something like that again. We’re not bailing you out of that one.”
>”Fine...” Chee sighs as the boat with the two lovers drifts out of the camera frame
>The three of you watch the tigress and vixen for a while as they float from one monitor to the next, until you’re joined by another familiar face
>The door to the control station opens up, and a sharp beak is the first thing to enter the room
>”A-ah, found you guys!”
>”Yo, Ace!” Rox says
>”Hello, Amadeus!” Chee sings
>The pheasant boy drops a wrapped muffin off on one of the tables, then rubs his neck with his free wing
>”You, uh, didn’t show up for your break again,” Ace says to Chee. “Figured you were busy, s-so I thought I’d bring you a snack.”
>”Oh!” Chee says. “You’re right! Guess I got preoccupied with the ride again. Oh well. Thanks for coming all this way up here, Amadeus!”
>”S-sure thing, no problem,” the male bird chuckles
>He turns to Rox, and you’re hit with a feeling of déjà vu
>”That, uh, ‘thing’ is all ready, whenever you guys want to stop over.”
>”Cool,” Rox says. “Thanks, bud. We’ll head that way in a little bit.”
>The pheasant disappears, giving a quick, nervous wave to Chee first
>The oriole waves him off in return, then leans in to you and Rox
>”Hey, Roxie...” Chee says in a hushed voice
>”Yeah, Chee?”
>”Do you think...do you think Amadeus LIKES me?”
>Oh, Chee...
>That poor, poor, naïve girl...
>Rox’s paw winds up for the mother of all facepalms
>But the wolfess stops herself and instead places her paw on her avian friend’s shoulder sympathetically
>”You know what, Chee? I think you might be right. I think Ace might have a bit of a crush on you....”
>Chee’s eyes go wide and she covers her beak bashfully
>”O-o-oh, I see.... I, uh, actually think he’s...k-kind of cute myself....”
>The bird glances to the monitors, catching a glimpse of Ace at the attraction’s entrance
>”Why don’t you take that break now, Chee?” Rox says. “Anon and I can show ourselves out.”
>”O-ok, thanks. I’ll see you guys later!”
>And off she goes, chasing down the pheasant through the streets of Whimsey World with her arms flapping
>Now that it’s just the two of you, Rox finally unleashes that forehead smack
>”That girl is something else....”

>Rox still doesn’t tell you what the ‘surprise’ is, but you start to get a few ideas as she leads you toward the center of the park
>Toward Whimsey Castle
>The crowds of anthros are starting to thin out as it gets later into the night, but the groups you pass still want to get one more picture with Rokk-Woof and her Fan-On
>You know Rox loves each interaction she has with her fans, but she pulls you down one of the less-populated streets so you can get to your destination faster
>It’s a good thing she did, because now you get to see something you’re glad you walked in on
>In a quiet part of the park is a cluster of anthro coordinators, with one unmistakably large tiger standing at the front of the pack
>Shearod-K looks like he was poured into his pinstripe uniform, and that any sudden move might rip the straining shirt clean off
>But the tiger’s comical appearance doesn’t detract from the ferocity of his size and authority, and the audience he’s speaking to clearly understands what he can be capable of
>His audience consisting of four human Whimsey employees and their anthro partners
>The humans stare unblinking at the tiger, just as afraid to make any sudden movement as the tiger is
>You can vaguely recognize them as some of your fellow seasonal workers who eventually were hired on full time, but it’s been ages since you’ve had any lasting interaction with the other human employees
>They recognize YOU pretty quickly, though, despite your masked appearance
>”Ah, it appears we have some celebrities in our midst,” Shearod-K chuckles humorously. “Come to inspect the new recruits, have you?”
>”Hey, Mr. K!” Rox says. “You’re looking pretty sharp tonight.”
>”Many thanks,” Shearod-K responds, spreading his arms out as comfortably as he can without tearing anything. “It felt appropriate to wear the traditional Whimsey garb for such an occasion, though it does not breathe as well as I would have thought....”
>”Try wearing one of the costumes sometime,” Rox snorts. “So, who do we have here?”
>Shearod-K wiggles a pen toward the quartet of humans, none of whom can seem to speak at the moment
>You don’t blame them for being in shock
>”These are the most qualified candidates we have scouted out for the next phase of Mr. Whimsey’s plan,” the tiger explains. “We are confident that these upstanding members of the Whimsey family will be able to work alongside a designated ‘sponsor’ in order to foster a bond not unlike the one demonstrated by you and Anon.”
>Shearod-K gives you a knowing smirk
>Each one of the other humans is accompanied by one of your anthro coworkers
>Chee’s seagull friend Petch is among the four anthros, as well as a somewhat nervous looking black panther: your short-term mascot partner, Baggy
>If you had to take a guess, Baggy’s role in getting assigned a human partner may have been more “accidental” than voluntary, similar to how a certain wolfess got paired up with her own human...
>”Glad I could be the start of something!” Rox says, puffing out her chest. “Just as long as they, you know...keep their noses clean. Don’t want them ending up like the ones that came before Anon....”
>Rox bears her fangs in a wicked smile, and the four humans swallow in unison
>Well, fear DID work on you too in the beginning, after all
>The humans are keen on giving Shearod-K their unbroken attention as he resumes explaining the procedures of Cast Night to them, while you and Rox continue toward the castle
>”Seem like nice people,” Rox says. “Can’t wait to mess with them.”
>Good grief, Rox...
>”Hey, you made it through the hazing just fine, right? Plus, they’ll be running to you for advice in no time. I’m sure it’ll be nice to have some other humans to talk to again, won’t it?”
>Now that you think about it, does it matter?
>The anthros have become your new friends now, and even though it’s relieving to have the freedom of leaving the park grounds without constant supervision you’re never in any rush to leave
>You get enough human interaction with the guests of Whimsey World, but you’ll never get bored with the animal-folk you rub shoulders with
>Still, if you absolutely HAVE to work alongside the humans once again, so be it
>It’s for a good cause, and there are those out there depending on you to keep the human-anthro partnership strong
>You and Rox approach the looming castle in the center of Whimsey World, passing by the newest addition to the park waiting just before the drawbridge
>A bronze statue of Darwin Whimsey Senior in his prime, with a young Chobbo standing next to him, hand-in-paw
>They both have those iconic goofy smiles sculpted into their faces, immortalized from the legendary picture they both shared
>Father and son, together for all time
>”The show’s going great,” Rox says quietly to the statue as you walk by. “All thanks to you, buddy.”
>She immediately turns and plants a wet kiss on your cheek
>You enter through one of the hidden employee backdoors to the castle and ascend up the stairs
>Higher and higher you go
>When you get to the top level, you notice how much more thematically decorated this area looks since the last time you’ve been here
>What used to feel like the storage space of an attic now truly feels like the upper floor to a royal castle
>You and Rox walk down a hallway, lined with gorgeous wooden doors that each have a name of one of the Whimsey princesses on them
>”They’re bringing back the ‘royalty rooms,” Rox says when you get to the right one
>What else? The Glacika Suite
>The wolfess opens the door and ushers you inside with a flourish
>”Letting guests use these rooms once again on special nights. Contest rewards mostly, I think. Can’t imagine how much it would actually cost to RENT one of these things for the night. Woof! But they need to do a bit of a test run first; make sure the beds are comfortable enough, you know?”
>Rox runs a claw along the billowy covering of the king sized bed
>She isn’t kidding about the rent
>The total cost of a whole family’s entire Whimsey vacation probably doesn’t stack up to a single night in a room like this
>Everything in this room is exquisitely designed with white gold and little snowflake embellishments
>It makes you think of winter, and even with how hot it is outside you find yourself wanting to enjoy the warmth of Rox’s fur and get out of “the cold”
>Near the stunning stained glass window is a chilled bottle of wine, patiently waiting for you and your wolfess
>Rox snatches it up and pops the cork, and at the same time you begin to hear the booming of distant fireworks outside of the castle
>They always begin at the edges of Whimsey World and work their way up to the middle, ending with the finale right over the castle itself
>Even for being so far away, every flash of light illuminates the stained glass and shoots rays of colorful light into the suite
>”Ever since that time we snuck up here, I wanted to make up for what a bummer that night turned out to be,” Rox says, pouring your glass
>Guess she never quite forgave herself for that night, but now it’s all going to change
>The wolfess hooks her drink arm with yours and peels her mask off with her other paw
>You get an unobstructed look at those sultry, breathtaking golden eyes
>”They say only princesses are supposed to be allowed up here,” Rox says. “I guess that’s why they bent the rules just for us. After all, you make me feel like a queen, Anon.”
>She sticks her tongue out at the cheesiness of her line, then plunges it into your mouth to give you a passionate kiss
>You haven’t even gotten to taste the wine yet, and it’ll probably be a while before you do
>When Rox finally breaks the kiss, she runs her muzzle all around your face
>”You make me so, so damn happy,” she whispers. “Even the worst days we’ve been through together have been better than the best days I’ve had to live through alone. Heh, I still don’t think I deserve someone as great as you. I don’t think I’ve been able to really show you just how much I appreciate having you around, either.”
>Rox sets her glass down, and you follow suit
>She steps forward, forcing you to step back as your legs are tangled with hers and your body moves along her curves
>”But I’m ready to do all I can to keep you in my life forever. Even if we get sick of this place somehow...I need to have you next to me wherever we decide to go.”
>Rox moves you backward until you trip onto the bed, then hops up herself and straddles you on all fours
>The wolfess hangs over you, nose to nose as she stares into your eyes with unmistakable, unparalleled infatuation
>”Hope you weren’t planning on going anywhere anytime soon though, champ” she says coyly. “We’re staying in here until they come to kick us out. Who knows when the next time we’ll ever get to try out a place like this?”
>Rox slowly lowers herself, aiming her muzzle for another deep kiss
>Right before you touch lips, the thunderous bang of the fireworks right outside the castle catches you both by surprise
>Rox flops down on top of you, grabbing hold tightly before she realizes what happened
>”Alright, screw this!” she growls. “This place never works. Next time, we’re going someplace quieter and as far from the park as we can!”
>Her frustration soon turns into laughter, keeping you in her powerful embrace as she rubs and nuzzles you
>The laughing continues for a long while, to the point where Rox is almost in tears
>Her furry body even shudders for a brief moment as she’s gripped by joyous emotion
>It’s bliss like she’s never felt before
>You stroke her fur and let her know just how deserving of happiness she really is, and how you’ll go on any — and every — adventure with her
>Rox sniffs and burrows her head into you even stronger
>”I love you, Anon...love you....”
>Her nightly routine already?
>Is it time for bed?
>”Give me a break, I’m just resting my eyes a bit,” Rox murmurs. “We had...a long day...you know?”
>Her voice gets slower and her words are punctuated with a yawn
>The only part of her left moving is the content wag of her tail
>You get the feeling she isn’t going to last much longer tonight after all, but that’s fine with you
>There’s no rush; you have your whole lives ahead of you, just as she’s said
>You’ll be there for the wolfess no matter where she does
>Whether that’s outside of the Whimsey grounds...
>Or right here in the happiest place on the planet



>The end
