>Due to a clerical error, you were loaded onto a prisoner transport vessel bound for Euren- an all-female prison located on an asteroid
>A maximum security prison
>On top of being sent to the wrong facility, you had been sent to the wrong KIND of facility, and your protests had fallen on deaf ears
>Long rows of benches stretched down the length of the ship, with several armed guards on each lane; your wrists are restrained to a metal ring between your legs
>You're seated with your back to the hull, attempting to block out the jeers and catcalls sent your way by the other prisoners
>Your neighbor, a musclebound Tigris woman, is attempting to show off her (admittedly) impressive physique by flexing her biceps
>Each time she flexes, she quickly glances in your direction to gauge your response
>So far you've ignored her, but this is getting old
>You shift in your seat to face her and her ears swivel towards you
>"Hey, nice gains", you say
>Her head whips around toward you and she beams
>"HAHA! THANKS!" she booms
>You flinch
>Holy shit, is that her inside voice?
>The Tigran goes back to her odd display, and sends you more glances than before
>Great
>The woman to your opposite side chuckles
>"I believe she's courting you," she whispers
>You turn towards the woman, a lean Lutra
>”Oh?”
>She nods
>”Tigran females are the breadwinners in their culture, so they’re more proactive with finding potential mates- there’s a male for every four females, so you can have any number of them courting a single male. They’ll participate in feats of strength-”
>”FEATS OF STRENGTH!” you shout, laughing
>”Uh, what?” she narrows her eyes at you
>”My bad, old Earth TV reference. Please continue.”
>”Anyway- they compete to show the male which of them is the most capable. It’s been that way for millennia, apparently.”
>”Hmm”, you say. You rub your face on the rough fabric of your uniform, hitting an itch on your nose
>”Their males sound like limp noodles,” you say, after a stretch of silence
>The otter-like woman snorts
>You turn towards the Tigran woman to see her going all out on the flexing
>....
>Apparently she was trying to get your attention while you were speaking to the Lutran 
>Haha, was she jealous?
>Her arm, shoulder, and back muscles are flexed and prominent
>She grunts from the strain
>The fabric of her shirt is stretched tight across her back and you swear you hear a seam rip
>She sees that she’s caught your attention, and her eyes gleam while she holds the pose
>It seems she’s waiting for another compliment- fuck it, you’ll humor her
>”Wow,” you say, “you must be very strong.”
>She smiles at you and nods violently
>An idea strikes you, and you flex right back at her
>You’re nowhere near her level of physique, but years of jiu jitsu had left you with a decent body
>The tiger’s eyes glitter and she gives you a tight nod of approval
>You spot another Tigran an aisle over attempting to join in on the muscle display
>You choke down a laugh
>”You two are perfect for each other,” the Lutran deadpans
>The Tigran gives a saintly nod
--------
>The three of you introduce yourselves and chat for a while before the Lutran, Sari, addresses the elephant in the room
>”You’re male, right? May I ask why you’re being sent to-”
>”A women’s prison?” you ask, finishing her question
>She nods once, before looking away in embarrassment 
>”Not sure, honestly- everyone I’ve spoken to has just given me the cold shoulder. Makes me wonder if my being here is something more than a simple error.”
>”If that’s the case, then I don’t envy you. You’ve already gotten a lot of looks from the other prisoners- it’ll only get worse when we arrive there”
>Jesus
>”Is that supposed to make me feel better?”, you laugh
>”Shit- I mean, uh- you just-”, she blubbers
>You suppress a laugh as she squirms in her seat
>You sit back and let her backpedal a little longer before you decide to spare her
>”Relax, I know what you’re saying; I’ll have to play it safe,” you say, winking at her
>She exhales in relief and visibly relaxes
>”Maybe cozy up to a mafioso,” you continue
>”That’s not what I meant,” she giggles
>Mae bumps her head against your shoulder, and shoots you a winsome grin
>”AND I’VE GOT YOUR BACK, HUMAN- SO THERE’S NOTHING TO FEAR.”
>Your ears ringing, you thank Mae and remind yourself to have the inside/outside voice talk with her in the near future
--------
>The ship docks and the prisoners are escorted out without incident
>You’re brought to a large atrium where the inmates are lined up in orderly rows, and guards process each person by scanning their subdermal implants
>It’s finally your turn, and once scanned you’re directed to a bare room with two female guards
>You’re instructed to strip
>”CHEEKS OUT, BALLS UP”, the first guard shouts
>"Always wanted to say that," she says, turning to her sniggering coworker
>Oh no
>”About that, I’ve been-”
>”CHEEKS OUT, BALLS UP”, she repeats, pulling on a pair of disposable gloves
>Please, no
>You sigh
--------
>The guard had looked you over twice, taking much longer than was necessary
>“Just in case”, she’d told her giggling coworker
>You wanted to curl up and die
>...
>After what feels like an eternity, the second guard clears her throat and taps her wrist
>Your molester slaps your ass and tells you you’re free to go
>You quickly dress and scurry from the room
--------
>You’re directed to a mid sized assembly hall, where the warden will (presumably) address the group of prisoners
>Guards are stationed across the room, closely watching the assembled inmates
>You make your way through, searching for your two shuttle buddies while ignoring the jeers and catcalls of the other prisoners
>”How’d it go?”, Sari asks, once you find her in the crowd
>”My ass hurts, and I might be traumatized. Other than that...”, you shrug
>She frowns
>”Your... ass hurts?” she asks
>”From the cavity search”
>”From the cavity search?” she repeats, frowning
>”Uh-huh. Do you not remember that bit?”
>”Uh, I’m sorry to be the one to tell you this- but, ah-”
>”Spit it out”, you snap, getting irritated
>”Cavity searches are outmoded- they aren’t necessary, you were scanned as soon as you entered that room”
---------
>The acoustics in the hall were fantastic
>After your outburst, the room went dead quiet, except for your echoing “FUCK”
>And now they’re all staring at you again
>It seems it caught Mae’s attention, she bounds up to you excitedly
>”HI HUMAN!” she shouts, grinning down at you
>Your poor eardrums
>You didn’t notice this when you were seated next to her, but she’s fairly tall, standing roughly a head and a half higher than you
>”HI MAE!” you shout, grinning up at her
>She beams
>Sari grimaces and rubs her small furry ears
>”Mae,” you begin, “we need to talk abo-”
>”Wanna ditch those two, handsome? I’ll keep you safe, for a lil’ sumthin’”, a voice behind you cuts in
>You turn around to reveal…
>Nobody
>”Down here”, the voice huffs
>It’s a literal shortstack
>A Marmotan, you think
>The small rodent looks you up and down, raising an eyebrow suggestively
>”What’s a ‘lil sumthin’?” you ask, innocently
>She snorts
>”You know what I mean, honey. ‘Favors’.”
>”Favors?”, you continue, feigning confusion
>”SEX!”, she shouts, dragging a paw down her face in exasperation
>You giggle
>An orange furry paw rests on your shoulder
>Mae gingerly nudges you aside to kneel down in front of the small woman
>Her ears are laid back, and her pupils are dilated
>”FUCK OFF, CUNT!!” she roars
>The poor woman scampers away
>You shoot a concerned look at Sari, you hadn’t expected such a reaction out of the friendly Tigran
>”Com-pe-ti-tion”, Sari mouths, pointing at the fleeing figure and then at you
>Suddenly, a horrible, screeching feedback assaults your ears
>"Whoopsy, fuc- fricking thing. Ms. Peabody, could you-" a small attendant rushes on stage and immediately fixes the mic for the warden
>"Ah, yes- thank you Ms. Peabody."
>The warden stands tall at roughly three and a half feet, some kind of squat ferret
>She's dressed in a charcoal suit and skirt, but her countenance betrays her business attire- she's positively beaming
>"Now then! HELLLLLLLO LAAAAAADIES!" the warden announces
>"WELCOME TO ST. EUUUUUUUURENS!"
>She's addressing the audience like they're attending a pep rally!
>You tell your thoughts to Sari, who shushes you and faintly smiles
>The warden spends the next half hour instructing everybody on what to expect during their time at the prison
>Take away message: toe the line and you'll be alright
>You weren't so optimistic, eventually you were going to be forced to be somebody's bottom bitch
>If not the whole prison's
>Christ, how is she so chipper?
>The warden then spouts some inspirational bullshit about perseverance and believing in yourself, but by this point you've completely tuned her out
>You're then instructed to form lines and wait to be sorted (again), which you do
---
>A guard approaches you shortly after the lines are formed- she's another species you're unfamiliar with, but resembles a dolphin
>"EEEEEE EEE EEEEEEEE EEEEEEE", she ululates 
>You tilt your head, confused
>"Uh?"
>The dolphins huffs and leaves, bringing another guard back with her
>"EEEEE EEE EEEEEE E EEEEEE", she says to the guard, pointing at you and then herself
>"Warden wants to see ya, follow her", the guard translates
>You laugh
>"Why didn't she just say that?"
>This apparently pisses the dolphin off, she quickly closes the distance between you and begins furiously ululating, forcefully prodding your chest for emphasis
>"EEEEEE," poke "EEEEEEEEE," poke "EE," poke "EEEEEEEEEEEEEE EE," poke
>"Her-" 
>"translator's"
>"broken"
>"is why", the other guard translates, miming the dolphin's cadence
>"hot stuff", the translator finishes
>The dolphin glares at the other guard, who winks at you- apparently the last bit was the second guard's addition
>You hear Sari choking down laughter
>Mae looks pissed that the dolphin touched you, but is demonstrating an impressive amount of restraint
>You make a mental note to reward her later, maybe you'll touch her bicep while she flexes
---
>The dolphin shoves you into the warden's office, apparently having had enough of your company
>The room smells of perfume, a spicy, fruity scent
>The warden looks up sharply from her desk when you enter, and quickly tosses a dogeared paperback behind her
>You catch a glimpse of a bedroom-eyed, shirtless and muscled Lupan male on the cover
>The dolphin situates herself in the far corner and the warden motions for you to have a seat in front of her desk
>The warden's desk is scaled down to her size, so you're practically looming over her in your chair
>Her office is about what you expected
>Countless cutesy porcelain figures clutter her desk
>Thick, serious looking tomes sit on her bookshelf
>MACRAME AND YOU
>THE KITTEN COMPENDIUM
>There's even a number that have been turned backwards, so the spines aren't exposed
>Probably more garbage romance novels
>She clears her throat to catch your attention, and opens up a file- presumably yours
>She smiles up at you
>"Now then, Jaime- I'm sure you're wondering what you're doing here, correct?"
>"Yes ma'am", you reply
>"Well, I'd like to assure you that it was no mistake. It's part of a recent initiative we've undertaken to ensure our inmates' happiness- think of yourself as, uh... a mascot... for the prison!"
>"....A mascot, ma'am?"
>She nods her head vigorously
>"Oh yes, a mascot."
>...is she serious?
>"Can I be straight with you, warden?"
>"Of course, I want you to be!"
>"I'm a little worried about my safety, being the only male inmate."
>"Hah, nonsense! My ladies would never lay a hand on you", she says, almost hysterically, attempting to wave your concerns away
>Your concerns have just doubled
>"I'll tell you what, though-" she says, continuing "considering your circumstances, I'm willing to give you a few special accommodations. How about a cell with a shower? I'll even allow you to pick your cellmate."
>You breathe a sigh of relief, you'd been especially worried about the shower situation
>"That'd be fine, ma'am. I'd like to have Mae as my cellmate- she's the Tigran who sat beside me on the transport."
>"Consider it done- Tina here will escort you to your new quarters and get you situated."
>"EEEEE EEE EEEEEEEE E", Tina chirps
>The warden frowns
>"Please get your translator fixed, Tina"
--------
>You're currently sitting on the bottom bunk in your cell
>It suddenly occurs to you that you never asked what your capacities were as the prison's "mascot"
>You'll have to ask the warden next time you see her
>The door opens, disrupting your thoughts
>It's Mae, escorted in by a guard
>Her face lights up when she spots you
>"HUMAN!"
>She pulls you in for a bonecrushing hug
>The fur poking out of the neck of her uniform tickles your face as she starts rubbing her head over yours, a deep, rolling rumble filling her chest
>She abruptly pulls away, looking embarrassed
>"AH! SORRY, HUMAN!"
>"Don't sweat it- I'm glad to see you too, buddy", you grin, nudging her side with an elbow
>She flashes a bright smile at you, exposing her sharp teeth
>You suddenly remember the reward you'd promised yourself to give Mae
>"Oh, hey! Could I ask you for a favor?"
>Her tail, which had been lazily flicking back and forth, suddenly goes still
>You've caught her interest
>"OH? SURE!" she says, attempting (and failing) to appear nonchalant
>"Can I- alright, this is going to sound weird. But, can I touch your biceps?"
>"HAHA, THAT'S ALL? OF COURSE!"
>Mae looks ecstatic
>She takes your hand and places it on her arm, flexing
>You squeeze- solid as a rock
>"Jesus Christ you're ripped. Very impressive, 10 out of 10."
>"Thanks for indulging me", you say, winking
>Mae giggles, beaming at you
-------
>You head to shower in the lavatory, which is separated from the cell by a door
>Thank god
>You were relieved, you'd always been uncomfortable bathing around others- and the prospect of doing your business in front of someone else had really freaked you out
>Stepping into the hot stream of water, you sigh
>The next few minutes are pure bliss
>The water abruptly stops as your time runs out, cutting you off heaven
>You towel off and step back into the cell, dressed in a fresh uniform
>Mae's doing crunches next to your bunk, heavily sweating
>"Mae. You going to have one? Hot water, I was surprised."
>Mae jumps up
>"SURE!"
>As she passes you, she sniffs your head
>A brief frown crosses her face
>"Everything alright there, Mae?" you ask, puzzled
>"O-OH, IT'S NOTHING, HUMAN. HAHAHAHAHA." she says, laughing longer than necessary
>She practically flees into the bathroom
>You'll have to tell her your name at some point
>Collapsing onto the bottom bunk, you sigh in relief- your first day in prison could have gone worse
>You had your own digs, a shower, and a very enthusiastic bodyguard
