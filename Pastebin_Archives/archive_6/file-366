>You groan in anticipation as your girlfriend approaches the bed, small bust kissing the cool air; freed from its cloth prison.
>Sitting up, your lower self stands at attention as Jade crawls up onto bed with you.
>Her large ears flick as she takes you in her paws and runs them up and down your length.
>You groan and thrust lightly against her pads.
>She giggles, angling her wide emerald eyes down at you before maneuvering her face to the tip and opening wide…
>She begins to take you in, squeaking around you as your girth fills her.
>Slowly she slides down, taking you farther and farther until you’re halfway down her throat.
>Her cute little neck is so tight it almost hurts; you can see the impression of your cock beneath her fur.
>But you’re only a few inches in. The majority of you remains free-hanging in the air.
>Jade tries valiantly to take just an inch more in, only to grunt in exasperation as yet again your penis refuses to fit in any one of her orifices.
>She pulls back and tries to push forward again, to set up some kind of pace, only to fail again as her throat constricts painfully around your too-large member.
>She’s hurting both you and herself at this point, there’s no way.
>Reaching down you lift her up and off your dick, lugging her to your chest and holding her there.
>The bunny slumps dejectedly against you, sniffling quietly.
>Just give her time, run your hand through her fur.
>You know how much this hurts her; you’ve done this before. You hum softly as you stroke her.
>After a few minutes of clinging to you and holding back tears she begins to calm down.
>”I just… I practiced all week for tonight,” she says with a sniff, burying her face in your chest.
>Oof. So that’s why she’d been so excited.
>Also explains her recent banana diet.
“Shh, shh baby it’s alright. We’re fine.”
>You cradle her in your arms, rocking back and forth.
“You know I don’t care about that stuff. I love *you*.”
>A few seconds more and she lifts her head, wiping at her eyes.
>Snot dribbles from her nose.
>Ew. Also, cute.
>You grab a tissue from the bedside table and offer it to her.
>The rabbit takes the proffered cloth, blowing her nose and throwing the balled-up paper off the bed to the floor.
>Messy little thing.
>”I’m sorry Anon,” she huffs, sitting up on your chest. Her weight pushes against you, but it’s not enough to hurt.
“You have nothing to be sorry about. Do you want to stop?”
>That snapped her out of it. “NO!”
>She gives you an angry glare, scooting back until her butt presses up against your softening manhood.
>You flex your abdominal muscles to avoid being painfully jabbed as she puts pressure on her front paws, lifting herself and turning around.
>She throws a determined look over her shoulder, rubbing you until you’re hard again.
>”The one thing I don’t want is for my… Problem to get between us.”
>Reaching down, you lay a hand on her head and scratch at her ears, earning a molten sigh.
“You don’t have any problems, babe. You’re perfect exactly as you are.”
>A non-committal grunt returns before she begins to lick up and down your shaft, sending bolts of pleasure up your spine.
>Squirming under her touch, you decide to return the favor and grab her small butt.
>The lagomorph stops licking for a second, squeaking as you lift her rump from a sitting position to lay it flat and give you access to her sex.
>The two of you have been together long enough, you know all her little patterns.
>Like for instance how she can’t focus on you very well when you slide your index finger across her slit.
>Yup, she’s completely given up on doing anything but cling to your cock as you slowly tease her lips apart.
>You pause, holding her in suspension as she pants against you.
>The rabbit whines, gyrating her hips against your fingers, until she remembers to resume her efforts on you.
>”S-sorry,” she mumbles around your rod.
>You hum by way of reply and slip a pinky slowly into her.
>Her back arches reflexively, thrusting her hips up and into your hands as she moans your name.
>”Fuuuuck…”
>It’s always like this. One little pinky is more than enough to set her off.
>The small mammal does her model best to continue giving you a… Whatever it is she’s doing down there.
>A whole-body dick massage?
>Whatever it is, it’s awfully fuzzy.
>But she’s losing ground; you’re up to the second knuckle and debating whether or not to switch to a ring finger.
>The rabbit slips a hand down to your sack, playing it through her fingers even as she licks and strokes your length.
>Alright, that’s it then.
>You go for gusto, pulling your digit out before sliding the larger one in forcefully.
>It glides in much more easily despite its increased size, her walls now sufficiently lubricated.
>”A… AH! Shit!” Your girlfriend calls out below you, gripping your legs tight and shuddering under waves of pleasure.
>You keep going, doing a ‘come hither’ motion with your finger inside her.
>Immediately she clamps down again, unable to speak save nonsensical gibbering.
>Well, she’s not going to be doing anything for you down there for a while. Might as well go all out.
>You lay back and drag her hips up to your face before digging in.
>Her familiar taste coats your tongue as you lap at her juices.
>Pressure builds on your skull as Jade squeezes your head between her thighs.
>Well, her legs. She’s a little short to actually get her thighs all the way around your head.
>Your pappy did always tell you to give it your all. Said something about life being ‘harder for people like you’ before laughing.
>Old jackass.
>You spell out the alphabet and receive more pressure in response.
>The bun doubles over, hugging against the top of your head and burying your face in her snach.
>You can’t breathe but it’s not really a big deal. You can take care of this quick.
>Picking up your pace, you locate the rabbit’s hood and tease the clit out from under it.
>You tug the now naked pearl lightly with your teeth and she spasms, rocking back and forth as she rides out her orgasm.
>The worn-out girl collapses to your side, breathing heavily before snuggling into your embrace.
>You return the hug, stroking along her back as she warbles happily.
>Suddenly she bolts upright; “Wait fuck! I forgot about you!”
>You chuckle softly, pulling her back down to you.
“We can take care of me anytime. Let’s just lay here.”
>You would never tell her that it’s difficult to reach orgasm with her usual method, that would destroy her.
>You’re just going to take care of yourself later, as usual.
>She struggles a bit, trying to get back up and return the favor but it’s for naught. She’s held fast. Stuck in the mud.
>Her thrashing dies down and she gives up; “I’m gonna fix this. I’ll find a way.”
>You shush her, pulling her closer to your chest.
>Sighing, she snuggles into your side again and mutters a few “I love you”s before drifting off to sleep.
>You do the same. Such is life with a smol bunny gf.
>It’s nicer than she thinks. You chose this. You chose her.

…

>The sun kisses your neck as you stride up the stairs to Jade’s apartment.
>You kick a loose piece of brick out of the way as you climb, glancing about the sunlit sidewalks.
>It’s been about a week since Jade came over to your place.
>You’re both tired during the week so you hang out on weekends usually.
>Neither of you are the inseparable kind of lover that can’t stand not seeing each other for a few days.
>Still you cherish these days together.
>Shooting off a quick text to the rabbit in question, you browse your favorite Botswanian butterfly enthusiasts’ forum.
>A few minutes later the door in front of you unlocks and opens, revealing the waist-height shining green eyes of your favorite anthro.
>You smile down at her;
“Hey babe. Long time no see.”
>Hm… Something’s wrong here.
>She’s looking around nervously and fidgeting her paws together.
>”Ah… Hey, Anon!”
>She doesn’t move aside to let you through the door.
>You cross your arms, gazing down with interest at the suspicious display before you.
“Okay, what.”
>”Wuh, uh, what do you mean what?” She responds innocently.
“I mean why are you just st—”
>You’re interrupted by the bunny’s phone buzzing. Once, twice. A text message.
>She quickly removes it from her pocket and glances at the screen before popping a relieved grin and opening the door wide.
>”Come on in, Anon! I’ve got everything set for today.”
“Oh?” You reply, stepping in through the door with her before shutting it behind yourself.
>Whatever that situation was, apparently it doesn’t matter now. You hope she’s not being stalked or something.
>As you step into the apartment… Wow. She really went all-out.
>Rose petals are scattered about the floor and a few scented candles are perched, lit, around the room.
>Her table is dressed up with a red tablecloth and a set of tall candles along with a bottle of red wine.
>She was never one for this kind of display, what exactly is going on here?
“Wow,” you breathe, taking the scenery in. “I think I might be a bit underdressed. Did I miss our anniversary?”
>”Hah, I just felt like getting all romantic tonight.” She walks excitedly to the kitchen where she rummages around for a bit before calling out, “Have a seat! I got food coming.”
>You do as you’re told, claiming one of the two undersized chairs set at the small table. Hell, she even laid out silverware for this.
>This must be her attempt at making up to you for last week. Aww.
>You’re inspecting your clothes self-consciously when Jade paces back into the room, balancing two plates on her hands.
>Holy shit. You didn’t even think she could cook.
>Steak and biscuits for you, a thick cut drowning in sauce, and a salad for herself.
“...Wow, Jade.”
>She beams, fiddling with her fork in embarrassment before digging into her salad.
>She seems oddly intent on avoiding your eyes tonight. Guess she’s really embarrassed about this side of her.
>But she can share anything with you.
>You give a reassuring grin before starting in on your own plate.
…
>You pat your stomach appreciatively.
>The two of you have been sitting and chatting for about ten minutes now, talking about the events of the week.
>Every once in a while she’s distracted by her phone, receiving and shooting off texts.
>Jade is excited about a potential promotion for herself and some new friend she’s really getting along with.
>You listen for the most part, contributing your own little stories when appropriate.
>The food is long gone and it was delicious.
>Apparently your little bunny is quite the cook, although she seemed apprehensive to accept your compliments when you tried to give them.
>”Anon…” She stirs you from your thoughts, “I actually had a bit of an… Ulterior motive for doing all this tonight.”
>Okay, that’s fine.
>Wait.
>Fancy romantic dinner, texting someone else before letting you in, some new ‘friend’, and now she wants to confess...
>She’s breaking up with you! She found someone else!
>She had said she’d ‘fix the problem’. She found some little rabbit guy that’s actually compatible with her body.
>God fucking damnit you really thought this one was special.
>You screw your eyes shut, praying to god that you’re wrong and it’s all a coincidence.
>You don’t want to look at her as she says it, and you really don’t want her to see your tears.
>You were really invested in this relationship.
>”Anon? You there?”
>Reluctantly you open your eyes, breathing heavily from your settling panic.
“Wuh… What is it?”
>Jade looks around nervously before pulling something out from under the table.
>What…
>She reveals a dark black, padded cloth.
>It’s got a pair of circular pads joined in the middle, from which strips extend with clasps at the end. Is that…
>A blindfold?
>”I just wanted to try something new! I swear it won’t hurt or be too weird.”
>Thank the lord, she’s just a fetishist.
>You breathe a sigh of relief, sinking down into your chair. Now this you can deal with.
>”A-Anon? You okay? If you don’t want to it’s alright…”
“No, no, I’d love to do whatever you’re into with you. Just… Got myself worked up over nothing there.”
>She lets out a bubbly laugh, she must have been just as scared as you were.
>”Okay, put this on.”
>Taking the article you admire the soft felt of its interior. This is some nice stuff.
>You take one last look around you before sliding it over your eyes and clasping the strap behind your head.
>The sounds of Jade pacing up beside you calm you before she pulls down on your sleeve, bending your head down to her level.
>She grabs the strap and tightens it before giving it an experimental tug, making sure the cloth won’t fall off by accident.
“Okay, now what? Are the candles really for pouring wax on me?”
>The rabbit gives another giggle, patting you on the shoulder as a sign you can stand up.
>”No, it’s much better than that. Follow me~”
>She grabs your hand and leads you through the room. You can only assume you’re heading to her bedroom.
*BONK*
>Yep, you’re headed to the bedroom alright.
>That was her low-ass awning colliding with your forehead.
>”Sorry! Oh my god I’m so sorry!” She gushes through anxious laughter.
“S’alright, no biggie,” you reassure, cradling your head for a second or two.
>The two of you continue through the apartment, this time with Jade warning you about potential obstacles before you run into them headfirst.
>Finally she stops you. You’re about to ask what next when she pushes you onto what you assume to be her bed.
>Chuckling, you roll over and sit up.
“Man, if I’d known you had a dominant streak I would’ve let you do this a long time ago.”
>You can practically hear her blush as she approaches you over the bed.
>”Sshhhhhut up,” she quips before grabbing your right arm and lifting it above your head.
>You’ve never heard of a position like thi—
*click*
>Oh that clever little bitch.
>She’s handcuffed your wrist to the headboard.
>Before you can react, she’s grabbed your other arm and cuffed it as well.
“You know, you’re a lot kinkier than I took you for,” you joke, before she grabs your chin and silences you with a forceful kiss.
>”Okay, stay right there~” she trills, as if you have any other options.
>You can feel her shift across the bed and dismount before her steps pad away.
>While she’s off you try to test the strength of your restraints. They don’t do much more than rattle when you try to tug them away from the bars, and your hands can’t reach each other so you can’t feel for the thickness of the chains.
>You also note, with a tinge of pride at your girlfriend's ingenuity and more than a little worry, that you also can’t reach your face to remove the blindfold.
>You really hope she’s not into pegging…
>You hear her open the closet. Oh god, she’s not getting her toys out is she?
“Babe, if you wanna get adventurous I’m fine with that, but I don’t know if I’m ready to do it blindfolded yet…”
>A deep snort follows, quickly covered up by Jade’s loud laughter.
>”Jeez, don’t worry. You’re gonna like this,” she says, and you can hear her padding quietly closer.
>”Now no more talking, okay?”
>The bed shifts as she gets up on it, inching closer to you.
>She rests some object by your head, you think?
>She’s almost on you now and she stops speaking, instead grabbing your belt and undoing it slowly.
>Your pants are pulled roughly down, taking your underwear with them.
>You can’t deny at this point, all the dominance play and mystery has definitely gotten you worked up.
>With pants no longer there to hold it down your dick springs free to bob in the air.
>A happy rumble emanates from between your legs before stopping abruptly.
>Was that a growl? Wow, she’s really getting into this roleplay thing.
>You feel fur play along you before she grabs you, running her paws up and down your length.
>You’re pretty hard by now, and there’s no chance to lean down and grab the little minx to show her a piece of your mind.
>You guess that’s why she did this, so you can’t stop her fro—
>Your train of thought comes to a screeching halt as a long tongue slides nearly all the way around your cock, dragged up and down in a vice-like grip.
“What the f—”
>Your cries are muffled by the weight of one bunny rabbit plopping her ass directly on top of your face from out of nowhere.
>”Shh, I said no more talking baby,” the rabbit atop you soothes, leaning back and letting her paws drift across your chest as she positions her thighs perfectly on either side of your chin.
>”Let’s put that mouth to a better use, yeah?~” She finishes before slamming down, forcing her vagina into your face.
>Her fur tickles your cheeks but it really doesn’t matter at this point.
>You try to protest as whatever is at your groin continues to slobber all over your cock, but your words only serve to stimulate the horny rabbit atop you.
>What the fuck, Jade?
>Who the hell is that down there? How is she okay with this?
>You gasp as the mystery person between your legs suckles on your tip before driving their head down, taking your entire length into what you can clearly feel is a long muzzle .
>You barely make it an inch past the maw and down their throat and they’ve already bottomed out against your pelvis.
>The feeling of their lower jaw slapping against your nuts reverberates through you, causing you to shudder and curse, much to your girlfriend above you’s enjoyment.
>”Aah, that’s it, just enjoy,” she croons, continuing to gyrate her hips against you, “and you know you’re allowed to use a little tongue, right?”
>This cheeky fuck. God you hope whoever’s down there isn’t a dude.
>But you trust her, and she apparently wants to do this so…
>You lap at her cunt obediently, sticking your tongue as far in as you can in your compromising position.
>You’re rewarded with loud moans and more pressure, a challenge you’re more than willing to meet.
>Meanwhile downstairs your new friend has begun to whine loudly as they slam down on you again and again, taking you deep each time.
>Their voice is definitely feminine, you discern through the sounds of vigorous sucking and whining.
>It’s been a long time since you’ve actually had successful head; you’re getting close...
>You signal your impending release by yanking at your cuffs.
>”I think he’s getting there,” Jade sings from above you, not slowing or letting your mouth free from her folds.
>A moan of understanding echoes through your dick and the unknown soldier speeds up.
>The mystery throat kneads and sucks on you through each stroke, pushing you over the edge as you climax directly into it, hips bucking and toes curling.
>Holy shit.
>You, Jade, and the creature beneath you ride out your orgasm for a few seconds.
>Your member pulses as it shoots burst after burst of pent-up lust into the maw of… Someone who is not your girlfriend.
>Speaking of, the rabbit in question now dismounts your head. You feel her lie down beside you, trailing a paw across your pecs.
“Wuh, urgh,” you sputter, “what the hell Jade?”
>She lets out a peal of laughter before reaching up and pulling off the blindfold, simultaneously turning your head toward hers.
>Your vision is filled with her viridian irises before she closes them and kisses you deep, shoving her tongue into your mouth.
>She breaks the kiss a few seconds later, leaving you panting.
>You haven’t been doing a lot of breathing these last few minutes.
>”I told you I’d fix the problem,” she coos, before looking down.
>You follow her gaze to see a brilliant white husky between your legs, licking cum off her muzzle and smiling happily at you with bright blue eyes.
>”Anon, this is Kyra, a coworker of mine. She came down here as a favor to me.”
>”Oh shut up, I was more than happy to help the two of you out. And Hiya! Nice to meet you, ‘Non. Thanks for having me. I heard you’re a fan of my cooking!”
>You glance incredulously between the dog and your girlfriend.
“Uh, same to you, Kyra.”
>You level your best ‘let’s get serious’ face at Jade.
“You know I only ever wanted you, right? You didn’t have to do… Whatever this is.”
>She hums joyously, snuggling up against you. “I know. But it’s totally worth it to see you finally get off for once.”
>”Now hush, let’s watch the action~”
>You’re about to question her when the husky below you takes her que, licking at your receding erection.
>Usually you can’t go another round immediately, but somehow this situation quickly gets you rock hard again.
>You consider yourself a loyal man but you’re starting to doubt your own body.
>Smirking smugly, the dog gives you a pat on the thigh as she continues her ministrations. “Boy, you really like me, huh Anon.”
>You blush and prepare to defend yourself before Jade silences you preemptively.
>”It’s okay, don’t worry. I love you, and I know you needed this.”
>She clutches onto you tight as the dog lifts herself off of you.
>Thank god, a moment of respite.
>Wait… She’s stepped forward a few feet and is squatting over you now, directly over your…
>Kyra reaches down and angles you into her triangular hole softly before descending.
>You gasp and she lets loose a bark as she continues to slip down, inch by inch, until you’ve hilted firmly into her.
>Her butt rests solidly on your pelvis and she gives a victorious howl, straddling your midsection tightly.
>She’s conquered you entirely.
>Jade, for her part, has been rubbing herself this entire time. She’s at a furious pace at this point.
>”Oh my GOD I’m so glad you don’t have a knot,” the dog pants, rising up before slamming home again. And again. And again.
>Her insides are burning, it feels like she’s trying everything to coax the cum out of you.
>But it’s too soon since your last explosion, it’ll take more than that.
“Wait wait, stop, we need protection! Get a condom!” You shout over the din of slapping flesh, fur, and liquids.
>Holy shit what are you going to do if you get her pregnant.
>The husky’s tongue lolls out as she struggles to answer you, only to give up after a few yips and pleasured moans come rather than words.
>You look to Jade, desperate to get Kyra off you before you all make a terrible mistake.
>She’s… Smiling? “She’s not in heat, hun. Perfectly safe. Just lay back and enjoy.”
>Fuck. You’re really gonna be doing this.
>The bunny, for her part, seems to notice the lack of progress.
>With a sly wink she rises and crawls around the warzone at your abdomen.
>You can’t see her anymore, hidden behind the dog riding your dick like a rodeo bull.
>Then you feel her.
>Warm air rushes over your balls as she breathes in your musk before sucking one nut into her mouth.
>The feeling is ungodly.
>Sharp bolts of sensation race through your body and you struggle against your cuffs and the weight on your lower half.
>Kyra takes this as encouragement and rides harder, leaning down and digging her claws into your now bunless chest.
>She brings her snout up to your face, deep sapphire eyes gazing into your own before she locks against your lips in a passionate kiss.
>Somehow, even as she shoves you inside her once again, the kiss feels lewdest and most forbidden of all.
>For a brief moment you find yourself wishing Jade was in a position to see it, to confirm that she was okay with it.
>These thoughts are interrupted as the mass of white fur above you begins to quake with the familiar signs of an impending orgasm.
>Jade seems to sense it, and works to make sure you finish on time as well.
>She’s practically shoved her nose into the bottom of your dick, surely being hit by Kyra’s ass as she descends over and over, as she suckles on your nuts.
>You feel her hands creep up your thighs until…
>Oh no.
>She worms a finger into your ass and you can’t take it.
>You release just as Kyra spasms atop you, clamping down and milking every last drop of cum from you.
>Jade continues to lick and suck on your emptying balls, finger held firmly in place by your tight clenching.
>WOAH, not fucking coo— Oh my GOD JESUs you’re not fucking into—
>Kyra looses an ear-splitting howl before muffling herself; locking her snout against your lips.
>She shoves her tongue much farther into your mouth than Jade ever could, practically slipping down your throat.
>You stay like this, pumping shot after shot of your seed into the dog as she viciously fucks your mouth with her flat muscle.
>You feel your girlfriend rise from her position, extracting her finger from you.
>Jesus Christ thank you.
>She slides up alongside the two of you, reaching up and unlocking one of your cuffs.
>Your hand drops to your side and she frees the other one before grabbing your chin and pulling you away from your unwilling congress with Kyra.
>She stares deeply into your eyes before planting a chaste peck on your nose, humming contentedly.
>Kyra still lays panting atop you, your softening member embedded deep within her pussy.
>Not looking away from your eyes, Jade speaks; “Thank you so much for doing this for me, Kyra. really.”
>”N... No.. No problem Jay,” she gasps, rolling off you and releasing your dick with a ‘pop’.
>She lays on your other side, paw on her forehead, completely spent. “Any… Anytime.”
>Jade perks up at that. “Really? You mean it?”
>The dog rolls to her side, looking over your chest to your girlfriend. “Yeah, this was… Great! I’d love to go again in the future.”
>You’re about to rebut, to argue that you only want your rabbit, when you take a look at her peaceful form.
>She looks practically euphoric, drinking in your exhausted form with her eyes.
>The protests die in your throat and you merely shrug instead.
>You lay back, taking your girlfriend in one arm and this… Eager canine in the other.
>The three of you lay still, breathing slowing as you drift off into sleep.
>You’ll figure all this out when you wake up.
