>Be Anon
>Moving from my old house in the countryside to a city apartment after finding a new job close to said city
>Apparently I’m gonna be living with a roommate
>”Let’s do this.” I say as I open the apartment door with my newly-acquired key
>Door-lock clicks and I open the door to a living room
>No lights on, which a bit weird
>TV is on and appears to be playing a old western movie
>Walk past the door, take off shoes, close door and walk further into the TV-lit living room
>”Hello? Anyone here?” I ask, scanning the room for any signs of life
>A noise somewhere between a groan and moan rises up from the couch, along with a female figure of busty size (mostly in the chest-area)
>”Umm… Are you my roommate?” I question as I try to find the light-switch with my left-hand
>Feel something plastic with my pinky
>Push and click
>And God said: Let there be light
>”Ah, my eyes! Who the…?” A female Lynx, I notice by the black tufts on her ears, almost shrieks and turns to me
>”Oh sorry, I was just…”
>...
>Wait a minute, that face...
>”That you Anon?” The Lynx dips her head to down a little while rubbing her eyes a little
>”Nope, It’s Chad from high-school.” I retort
>”Heh unlikely, he doesn’t smell as nice as you.” She laughs as she opens her eyes and flips herself over the couch
>The first thing I take note of, as she steps closer to me with her long legs, is the fact that she’s literally wearing nothing but a bardot top and black panties
>From her chin to the inner-thighs, ran white fur and the rest of her body is covered in a goldish-brown coat of fur
>That, combined with the clothes she wore (or lack thereof) made many things hard for me
>Such as my attempts to hide the most biggest boner I think i’ll pop in my lifetime
>”Uh...Can I go set my stuff and maybe take a shower? I’ve got some stuff to drop off.” I turn my gaze from her towards the wall on the right
>”Yeah, that’s cool. Use the room near the window, since that’s empty.” She turns on her feet and points at the window-side room
>I speed-walk towards it, open the door and enter
>Close the door and drop my bags
>I sigh and turn my head to look at the current room i’m in
>It’s really empty, leave a single bed, a shelf opposite of it and a desk to side of the bed.
>Lay down on the bed and just relax
>Jeans feel so tight I think they’re gonna rip
>Cast them and  my jacket aside, leaving me wearing only boxers and turtleneck
>Tent still pitched, but not as tight
>Close my eyes and think about her
>Move my hand
>”Ja-
>Hear the door open and I snap my eyes open, was the door that loud before?
>”Anon, I’m gonna ma-”
>She opens the door fully open and sees me, laying on the bed with a massive hard-on tent and hand halfway downtown to faptown
>My eyes instinctively turn to her body and I feel my erection throb with vigor
>”-ke dinner…” She finishes her sentence while her eyes wander down and she seems to shiver a little
>”So uh, you can go take your shower while I cook…” She turns away to leave, clear awkwardness in her voice as she closes the door
>’Dick why?’
>I slowly get up and open the door
>Can’t see her anywhere, probably went to cook
>Walk to the door that looks like it could be the bathroom
>Open door and walk in, noticing the dark-red carpet on the tiled-floor
>I guessed right
>Close the door and start taking off my shirt 
>My mind wanders into thoughts of her walking in on me right now
>’Am I really that desperate?’ I think as I throw away my boxer and pull the shower curtains away absent-mindedly
>The curtains move away and well, I find her standing behind them
>”Jamie!?” I step back in shock and she almost knocks me down with a sudden hug
>”Anon, you’re pretty dirty, getting excited like that~” She snarky tone is clear, even though her face (and rest of her body) is pressed up against me, her arms feeling my back
>Boner gets up and I feel her right paw swirl around it while she smugly turns to face me
>”You’re so hard~ Guessing you haven’t fapped in a while?” She whispers to my ear
>Feel my erection throb in her paw, and I shiver as she starts to move her paw back and forth
>”Ah, Jamie…” I close my eyes and call her name as she continues her movement
>She speeds up slightly and I feel my legs shake a little
>Feel her kiss my lips and then her wet and warm tongue entering my mouth
>I respond with my own, both of our tongues feeling the other
>Open my eyes and see her seawater blue eyes staring at mine
>I pull her closer with into an embrace and feel my member sliding between her thighs
>”A-Anon, give it to me…” Her pleading voice whispers to me and she lays herself on her back on the carpet and I follow her body, hands tracing her sweaty, furred legs
>She shiver at my touch and my hands reach her hips
>I turn my eyes upwards to see her face, breathing heavily
>Breasts moving slightly with every breath in and out
>My hand move upwards again, feeling her fur, skin and ribs
>I then reach her breasts, feeling their soft, round shape
>Then I trace her nipples with my finger as I move my pelvis closer the hers
>Inch myself closer to her, me sitting on my knees and her legs spread above mine
>”A….Anon…” Her breathing gets louder as I get closer
>I feel the warmness just by being close to the entrance of hers 
>”I’m gonna do it.” I whisper, sweating slightly
>I push myself forward and raise my knees as well
>”Ah!....Ah~” Jamie shivers and almost screams as I enter her
>She feels like slick and warm inside, and I start moving
>”Oh God...Anon!” She unsheathes her claws and digs them deep into the carpet
>”Jamie..Jamie!” I repeat her name while continuing to thrust
>Her breathing and shaking gets intensive as does my movements
>She then holds me close, pushing my face to her breasts
>”Anon! I…Ah~” She digs her claws into my back, but I’m too far in to stop now
>”Jamie, I’m about to..!”
>”Anon, let it all in!” She desperately holds me even closer
>She tightens and I cum immediately after
>”Ahh!!~” She moans louder than before, arching her back
>Both of our bodies shake in a wave of pleasure
>We stay there for a couple seconds, just listening to each other breaths
>”Anon, I love you…” She kisses me
>”I love you too, Jamie…” I return the kiss and I get off top of her, flopping next to her
>We layed there for a couple seconds before I get up, legs a bit wobbly still
>”Your claws are really sharp.” I comment as I look in the mirror at my back
>Small cuts, nothing major
>”Oh, sorry…”
>”Don’t worry about it. By the way, need me to carry you?”
>”Nah.” She slowly raises herself and pulls her panties from a hidden drawer
>”Oh so that’s where you hid your clothes.” I say as I put on my boxer
>”Yep.” She pulls up panties and turns to me
>I pat her: “We’re sleeping in your bed tonight, right?”
>”Of course!”
>We walk side-by-side to her room, which is almost identical to my room, except hers is has a bit more stuff in it
>”You first.” She pulls me to her bed and I slide myself under the blue covers, with her snuggling to my side
>”We should have done this those 4 years ago.” She point outs, embracing me
>”I know, but better late than never right?” I pull up the cover on our mostly-naked bodies and return the gesture
>I close my eyes and take in her and her room’s smell
>”Oh, I probably should have mentioned that I’m in heat.”
>”Yes, and?”
>”...Wonder how many kids we’ll have?” She asks with a curious tone
>”Well, we’ll find out someday, but tonight we’re gonna go to sleep.”
>”Agreed. Goodnight.” She shifts herself a little
>”Goodnight.”
