I was actually writing a story about that, but I kind of dropped it for a few reasons. I now use the story as a sort of scrapyard that I pull ideas from to apply in some form to the other things that I'm ̶w̶o̶r̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ procrastinating on. Basically how it went was:"
 
Character names:
Human - Jeffory Hayes
GP's ex - Andrew Baker (The furboi who appears in most ghost pupper images)
Ghost pupper - Alice Foster
 
>Start off with Jeffory hanging out with Andrew
>He mentions that he used to be in a relationship with Alice, explains that they parted ways a few months ago
>This greatly interests Jeffory
>They talk about her a bit more, the furboi giving Jeffory pro tips about her, as well as where she lives
>Goes directly to her place as soon as Andrew heads out
>Oh shit, she's real
>He talks to her for a bit, spends the night on the couch, heads to work the next day (never got to the part where I mentioned his job, but I recall intending to have him work in a warehouse), and researches her murder on the internet when he gets back to his apartment
>He finds pic related (https://s1.desu-usergeneratedcontent.xyz/trash/image/1555/80/1555803997221.png)
>He just stares at the picture for a while, observing the terrified and confused look on her face
>He was already immensely interested in Alice, but this is where his crusade to find a way to save her begins
 
>Buys a shitload of books on magic and time travel, trying just about everything that has a chance of working
>Creates a study/laboratory in her kitchen, spending just about every afternoon in there working on ways to save her
>Takes breaks, either to go to the spot where she was murdered and practice takedowns and infiltration tactics for when he actually has to save her, or hanging out with/interviewing Alice
>Eventually, as the weeks drag on, her neutrality towards Jeffory fades as she realizes that he's not going to stop wasting his life on this wild goose chase any time soon
>She starts trying to convince him to give up and accept what happened, with her assertiveness gradually increasing as he continues to ignore her
>Eventually gets to the point where she strikes at him, gets him out of the house, and tells him that she'll have to kill Jeffory if he comes back again
>He just comes back with a jug of holy water
>Has a jug that he keeps secured on the kitchen counter, pretty much keeping her presence out of the room entirely
>A dropper that he uses to apply holy water to his gas mask (to protect himself) and along the sides of a storm lantern (so that its radius of light acts as a sort of reality anchor)
>During this period, he develops a symbol - two rings connected by an arc which runs through just a small portion of one of the rings, and then through the entirety of the second ring
>This represents him only being around for only a short period of Ghost Alice's existence, but going to another world he saves her, and they can spend their lives together happily ever after
>He makes a wooden carving of this symbol and applies it to the shoulders of his jacket and the nose of his gas mask
>One of his nicknames in the story was going to be "the cultist"
>This carries on until he eventually finds a method of creating a time portal that actually works
 
>Cue scene of the stoic cultist silently marching through the rotting house as the hallways drip with blood, twisting and shrieking at him; rotting limbs reaching out, only to be cast away by the illumination of his lantern.
>Marches up the stairs while Alice futilely tries to stop him at the top of the stairs before being repelled by the lantern
>He sets up in the bathroom next to where she died
>Does the portal thing
>Gets his knife
>Hops in and stabs the (furboi) murderer in the throat
>He's done it
>In spite of all the spirit's resistance, all the odds in the world being against him, he managed to go back in time and save her, and there she was right in front of him
>Scared and confused, but alive
>He rescues her and explains the situation (conveniently leaving some parts of the story out)
>Convinces her that they should bury the corpse in the woods, as the police would otherwise find out that he's a time traveler and almost certainly lock him up in a laboratory for the next 30 years
>Because he won't own his apartment until several decades from now, and he doesn't have a job, she agrees to let him stay
>He goes to bed (either with her or on the couch, I hadn't made my mind up on that part), and later wakes up in the middle of the night
(For this part, I'll actually post the scene itself, as it's one of the few parts of the story that I actually finished.)

>In summary, Alice comes back in her monster form in the middle of the night, and without his gas mask or lantern to protect him, she ceases his vital functions in a rather unpleasant way
>He later wakes up as a ghost
>Goes downstairs to find her waiting there
>Jeffory is a bit miffed that she just fucking murdered him in his sleep
>She apologizes but reminds him that she warned him that this would happen if he came back, and he came back anyway
>He didn't actually go back in time; ghost Alice just bamboozled him with her ghost powers
>Tricking him with a very elaborate and well-planned illusion was the only way that she could get his defenses down, and the only way that she could put an end to this madness
>Jeffory greatly dislikes this fact
>Eventually, however, Jeffory starts to accept being a ghost and accepts her being a ghost now that he can better relate to her
>Their relations quickly being to heal now that his obsession is out of the way
>Over time, they become a /hmofa/ ghost couple, silently walking through the forest together at night, watching movies and Youtube videos together via the neighbor's internet, ghost sex, etc. etc.
>Even though he's accepted the situation, Jeffory tries desperately to keep a sense of normalcy whenever guests are around, never appearing in any form other than his "alive" form and trying not to use any supernatural abilities when around the living
>And so they un-lived together, happily ever after, like a couple of adorable, rotting cadavers.

The story's over now, fuck off
