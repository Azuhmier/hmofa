>you are anon and you just pulled into your driveway for the second time today
>you park the car, turn off the engine and gather up the spoils of your travels before getting out and walking towards the front door
>glancing in through the window on the door you're greeted by a sight thats half familiar and half unexpected
>coco is there, bouncing in place in place from happiness as you expected
>but bailey is also there and she doesn't seem nearly as happy to see you
>she glares at you from behind the glass, using 1 hand to hold back coco, probably the only thing keeping her from inadvertently pressing her breasts up against the glass again
>coco also seems a lot quieter in the presence of bailey then she would normally be in this situation
>you have a pretty good guess as to why bailey is mad at you
>you gently lay your cargo next to the door since you know if you don't then as soon as you open that door it's going everywhere
>fishing your keys out of your pocket, you unlock the door and let yourself in   

"Hey girls I'm home"

>the words had barely left your lips when bailey grabs you by the collar and yanks your head down to hers
>this is exactly what you were expecting and you're much better prepared for it then when coco tried a similar trick on you
>not content to let the enemy be the one to make first contact you fearlessly press on, catching bailey's lips with yours 
>despite losing the element of surprise bailey still went ahead with her offensive, pushing her lips against yours in a desperate bid to reclaim the initiative
>it would all be for naught as your forward forces began their double flanking maneuver, your left hand reaching down and grabbing her by her soft tush and lifting her up to your level thus regaining the height advantage, forcing her to either hold onto you for support or dangle her limbs uselessly
>just as according to plan she chose to support herself, wrapping her legs around your waist as she simultaneously used her hands to try to push you away, a blatant attempt to retreat and regroup to go in for another assault
>this is where the second half of your flank came into play, right hand reaching up to cup the back of her head, cutting off any hope of retreat  
>with victory nearly in your grasp you throw everything you have into this attack even as bailey still weakly struggle against you, frantically looking for a path of retreat
>the realization of defeat, that all paths to victory are closed off to her, causes her to, in a moment of weakness, whine pitifully into your mouth
>she probably hoped this would net some mercy for her but you will accept nothing less then complete and unconditional surrender
>that moment of weakness left her completely defenseless against your final assault, exploiting a tiny opening you forcefully push your tongue inside her mouth to to do one on one combat with her tongue
>baileys tongue is a worthy foe, covered in tiny spikes any brush against it is like rubbing against sandpaper
>but the superior size and strength of your tongue ultimately wins the day, forcing your opponent into submission you're allowed to run wild inside her mouth, running your tongue along her sharp predatory teeth, caressing the inside of her cheeks and the roof of her mouth
>even her bodies struggle against you has ceased, now only holding herself close against you, letting you do whatever you wanted to her body
>with that final admission of defeat you let up on the pressure, removing your mouth from hers and easing her to her feet
>that should get the jealousy out of her system 
>it takes a second for her to regain her composure, but when she does all she can manage is an embarrassed look at you and coco before turning and running down the hallway towards the living room without a word
>luckily for you coco has a few words to break the silence

"Me next! Me next!"

>quickly bounding up to you coco is able to plant her lips right on yours since there is not nearly as much of a height disparity between you and coco as there is between you and bailey
>after coco takes a few quick licks against your lips you decide the best course of action is total surrender
>you know that coco could keep up the fight all day if she needed to and letting her do what she wants would be far better than any pyrrhic victory you could eck out against her
>throwing open the gates you let her tongue past your lips and into your mouth
>as she hugs herself against you, you offer no resistance as she plunders your body for all the pleasure she can get out of it
>you're even complicit in it as you raise your hand and begin to pet her head causing her to moan out into your mouth
>once she has satisfied her lust for you she lets go of you and tells you that she loves you
>you offer a scratch under her chin which she gladly accepts, tail wagging slowly, before turning around to gather your loot  
>closing the door behind you, you make your way down the hallway with coco close in tow

"Ooooh what do you got? I thought you were just getting money, Is it food?"

>you tell her to just be patient as you round the corner into the living room/kitchen, not wanting the surprise to be ruined for her
>bailey is lying on the couch as she holds a large pillow against herself, still not saying a word as you entered
>you lay all your stuff on the counter and put everything except the tub the old lady gave you where it belongs as coco watches you closely
>as soon as you pop the top of the tupperware container you can already hear both coco and bailey sniffing the air in interest
>you use your body to hide what your doing as you portion out the meal onto 3 plates
>now with both of their eyes locked on you, you turn around with a plate of turkey diner in each hand, walking over and placing 1 in the paws of coco and the other on the table in front of bailey
>bowing with a little flourish you told coco and bailey to dig in, not that they needed such invitation, already devouring the turkey like wild animals
>you go back and grab your plate and pop it into the microwave
>before the timer even dings coco and bailey have already completely cleaned their plates
>taking the warmed up turkey over to the living room table you plop yourself down next to bailey
>coco comes and sits down on the other side of you
>a relaxing dinner cuddling up with your 2 loving pets sounds real good after a day of hard work providing for them
>unfortunately you get no such thing as you have to watch both coco and bailey like a hawk because they both keep tying to steal your food every 10 seconds
>no rest for the weary
>at least bailey is over her embarrassment
