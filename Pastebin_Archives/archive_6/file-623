>Be you, Inmate #A0382916
>Not for long, however
>After promising the military a sizable chunk of your life, a small incident overseas landed you a sudden PCS to Fort Leavenworth
>Do not pass go, do not collect $200
>Fortunately, your contract was coming up and re-enlistment wasn't an option
>You remember walking out of there with the single-minded determination to just get to your death-bed without too much more trouble
>You took a quick inventory of the items you were allowed to have back
>Clothes, old backpack, plastic baggy filled with little sundries, a map of the surrounding area, an old phone, and a wallet running on empty
>Taking a quick stroll around town, you eventually crash on a nearby park bench and consider your current situation
>Family made their stance on you perfectly clear
>Along the lines of "Fuck off, you gave this family a bad name, we never want to see you again"
>Charming
>Couldn't go to anyone in the service now, and civilian friends were few and far between
>You're a vagabond now, and not even the cool leather jacket biker kind
>Sun was starting to set now, interrupting your melancholic brainstorm
>As much as you enjoyed your time passed out on benches before, you're in unfamiliar territory
>Screw it, you may not be wanted back there, but at least you knew your old town somewhat
>You pulled out your phone and called for a cab
>Fare: $34.23. There went a meal or a comfortable night
>Now, for accommodations 
>A couple of hours later, you found out that every single fucking motel in a straight line from your drop-off point was "booked"
>Bullshit, they just didn't want you in there, like you got some sort of "taint" about you
>You decided to just keep walking, until you notice a strange change in your surroundings
>It was unmistakable, you had managed to waltz your way into the ghetto, and not the kind you're used to 
>Weighing your options, you eventually decided that at least, you could probably crash at some cheap roach hotel
>As you headed deeper into the area, you catch the occasional glimpse of some of the ghetto's lovely inhabitants
>Anthros, every single last one
>You've dealt with quite a few in your time, some with friendly intention, most with hostility
>When the two cultures clashed, you were at the front lines, playing escort and keep-away
>Sometimes, you like to joke that you were the reason humans and anthros could live together in relative peace 
>You doubt your current audience would find it funny
>Trying to avoid the damning glares you could feel coming from nearly everywhere, you dunk inside an alleyway...
>And immediately get the attention of 3 anthros stationed at the other end
>Details were hard to see in the dark, but they didn't look so friendly
"Fuck you think you doing here, skinhead?!"
"Excuse me?"
>The largest one from the pack moved his way closer to you
>Without any lights, you could still make out some features: possibly dog, mohawk-looking haircut, and... surprisingly small?
"I said what the fuck you think you doing around these parts?! You a long way from home, asshole!"
>You decide now would be a good time to take your own step forward
>You were always told you had a presence that could scare a corpse
>And as you begin to size yourself against your possible threat, you can't help but grin from ear-to-ear
>You just lost everything, finally left prison, could be basically considered left for dead
>And a fucking chihuahua is trying to mug you! 
>And to top it off, at around 6', you have at least 3 feet over him!
>But if his mind can comprehend it, he isn't showing it
>He just keeps eyeing you down like he could kill you in a heartbeat
"Look, I'm just trying to find a place to stay. I don't want any trouble."
"Well, it just came looking for you, dumbass. Maybe if you pay up, I'll let you run along."
>Okay, you are not going to deal with this shit, not today
>You lunge forward, grabbing your potential charity case and slamming him into the wall head-first 
>Taking a quick glance away while he's dazed, you make sure his friends aren't going to rush in to make this more of a fair fight
>They probably didn't care TOO much for him
>Picking up the fallen assailant, you hoist him up to eye level (holy fuck, he is light), and pin him against the wall
"Listen! We can do this the easy way or the hard way."
>Good job, Mr. Fucking Cliche
"FUCKYOUfuckyoufhuhchkyhohufuchkyohufhuchkyuufuuuuuu"
>Damn, this little bastard has no sense of self-preservation
>...Wait, no, shit, you're choking him
>You've already committed assault in the first day out of the pen, let's not add murder to that
>You ease your elbow off of his throat while maintaining the attachment to the wall
"Sorry about that"
>18 years in the military, and you're still a social bumblefuck
>Your new friend just growls at you
"Look, can you just dire-"
>Your request is interrupted by a wad of spit hitting you in the face
>Today is not your day, and you have all but lost patience
>You remember a "little maneuver" an old friend used before to get info out of guys he had carte blanche on
>Falling back on that memory, you pull your left arm back
>And, in a flash, thrust it forward and clutch the ever-loving shit out of your victim's crotch
>In hindsight, your friend may have been gay
>Placing your right hand over your casualty's mouth, you tighten your grip and listen to the muffled yips
>Hang on...
>You take a moment of assessment and realize something
>You're not squeezing any balls...
>In shock, you jump back and let your new girlfriend hit the ground, coughing
>Assault, both physical AND sexual?! You're just batting a million today
>Paralyzed from astonishment, you just stare at the anthro as she slowly stabilizes herself on the concrete
>She catches your glance and with a pathetic scowl, points  towards the other end of the alleyway
"Out there, take a right, big sign..."
"Um... thanks?...S-sorry about..."
>Why do you do this to yourself?
>You decide to just enact your American culture and give her $20 for her troubles
>That was either the most disturbing tour guide, or cheapest hooker you've ever experienced
>You're just glad the cops were absent during the whole endeavor
>Following her instructions, sure enough, you come across one of the shadiest hooker-murder motels you've ever seen
>You can even see crime scene tape on one of the doorways
>If there is a benevolent god, you'd probably be getting that room
>Walking around the place to examine it some more, you notice nothing else too terribly shady
>Nobody's fucking, nobody's screaming blood murder. 
>It's oddly peaceful
>Before you enter the main building, you catch sight of the person working the front desk and stop yourself 
A catgirl, with tuxedo pattern fur? Could that...? No, that can't be!
>With a deep breath, you push open the door, and hear a familiar voice that confirms your speculation
"Hello, and welcome to th- wait a second, Anon?"
"B-Beth?"
>With surprising speed, Beth leaps over the table and nearly pounces on you as she wraps her arms around you
>Guess this day isn't that bad
"OMIGAWD!IHAVEN'TSEENYOUINSOLONG!IT'SBEENLIKEFOREVER!"
>As she runs herself dry rambling into your chest, you reminisce about how you knew her
>She was your best friend as a child, much to the disapproval of your family, but you two stuck together through thick and thin
>You recall she did always have the biggest crush on you, but the only time she tried to make a move on you, it did not end well.
>Not because of you, but your father caught you two. Beat you something fierce, and forbid you from seeing her.
>Considering how many times you've pissed off your family, you're surprised this is the final straw.
>Snapping out of your nostalgic haze, you realize that Beth hasn't been talking for awhile and has just been staring at you as you mentally drift off
>Being a man of action, you return the embrace and lift her up in the process, earning a cute little squeak from her as she surrenders herself to your side of the hug
>You eventually lower her down and start rubbing her head, so you can get a good look at her
>As she purrs happily into your hand with closed eyes, you see the classic Beth characteristics
>Only the right ear stands up, cute white nose, and white fluffy chest
>You remember, the night before you shipped out, you had shared a bed with her for the first time!
>Well, that was the only time you've shared a bed with anyone, and it was more you used her as a bed, but it was still great for both parties!
>Remembering what you came here for, you cut your intimacy short and cleared your throat, getting Beth's attention
"Oh, sorry, it's just, I haven't seen you in a while!"
"I think I can tell that you're more than happy to see me."
>Beth chuckles softly as she returns to her previous spot behind the front desk
"So what'd you come here for? Come to see about the crime scene?"
"I need a room."
"You always were so direct. What, did you have no better choices?"
>You recounted your past day to Beth, telling her how you just got out of Leavenworth, how you took a bus here, and how you ambulated your way here
"Quick question: Did poor old little Anon happen to run into a big mean gang of roving dogs?"
>Taken aback, you try to stammer out a lie about coming here without any incident, but she busted out laughing
>You never were a good liar
"Let me guess, they snatched your wallet and ganged up on you?"
"N-no, I... uh... got into a bit of a scuffle with the leader..."
"And...?"
>Just wanting to get it off of your chest, you blurt the rest of the tale out
"Ithrewhimagainstawallandhisfriendsranaway! IpinnedhimupagainstthewalltryingtofindoutaplacetosleepbutIwaschokinghimsoIadjustedmyselfandtriedtoaskhimagainbuthespitinmyfacesoIirongrippedhisdickbuttherewasnodickanditwasactuallyafemalesoIlethergoandshepointedmetohere!"
>She just stood there, mind trying to comprehend what you just said 
>Ultimately, she snickered at your recollection 
"The first day out of prison and you just immediately go for pussy, huh? Maybe I can help?"
>She leaned herself forward, pressing her breasts onto the desk and allowing you to get a glimpse, no, a good eyeful of her cleavage
>She was always more on the leaner side when you were both in high school
>How the fuck did she get so curvy?
>Easy now, Richard, we came here for a specific purpose, and no succubus will tempt us!
>But...maybe you could try your irresistible charm here
>Not that you've ever tried it before, and you're pretty sure it's resistible
>Fuck it, you have fingers. Anthros fucking love human fingers
>You quickly close the gap between you and instantly begin working your magic on her fur
>She gasps in mock surprise and soon lays her head on the table, purring like V8 as you run your hand around her head
>You wonder off-hand about getting a job at that one human-anthro porn company, what was it, Petterz?
"Listen, love, I've traveled a long ways to get her, and I could really use a bed. Maybe someone to help me warm it up too?"
>As you finish saying that, you see Beth's tail grab a set of keys from the hooks behind her and drop it on the counter
>You give the tail a good pet as thank you, and pick up the keys
"Here you go, room 07. Sorry, but I won't be able to meet you in there. Someone has to be out here, but still, you can come and see me anytime."
"Thanks, love! How much do I owe you?"
"Like I said, just come and see me."
"I think I will."
>Before walking out, you grab Beth close and give her a quick chaste kiss, just to really tease her
>You step outside and give yourself a full round of mental hi-fives
>You find your room and drop your backpack off, as you make your way to the bathroom
>Again, surprisingly not-as-shady as you would think
>No mold, no guy without kidneys, no lipstick on the mirror
>Speaking of which, you give yourself a quick once-over
>You got scars, stubble, and your classic bald dome
>You took note to grow a beard out now that you could, but keep shaving your head
>But for now, you needed sleep
>So you threw your clothes off, and fell face-first on the bed, clad only in underwear, as you let the a/c's hums slowly lull you to sleep
