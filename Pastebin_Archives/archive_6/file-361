Evidence of Creature has been observed in the jungles in the subcontinent of India. It has a specific suspected range in the east of India, listed elsewhere. 

Creature has the appearance of a bipedal female lion with a scorpion tail. Creature is estimated to be between 7 feet and 2 meters tall. Creature reportedly has long, extremely sharp teeth. The long teeth reportedly gives the creature a preference for smiling.

No video recordings of the creature have been made yet, and so most of the conclusions as to its hunting habits come from analysis of suspected hunting sites. Suspected hunting sites can be most easily identified by an excess of blood and a lack of any other remains in the area. Creature appears to be an ambush predator. It is suspected that the Creature uses its sting to paralyze the prey, which it then eats entirely.

Known to locals as the "Nanti"
