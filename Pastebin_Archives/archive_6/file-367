>Bland pop music drones quietly through crappy speakers as a drop of sweat rolls down your forehead.
>The hot, stagnant air in your turned-off, generic economy car makes it feel like you can’t breathe, but you prefer it to the atmosphere awaiting you inside.
>The muffled sounds of chirping birds and roaring lawnmowers drifts through the windows.
>You are Anon. Husband, father, and office drone.
>You’ve worked hard to afford this little slice of suburbia for yourself and your family and you wouldn’t trade it for anything.
>And yet here you are, stewing in your own sweat as you stare through the windshield at your closed garage door.
>Damn thing hasn’t worked in at least a year.
>Not that it really matters, you only have two cars between your wife and yourself and the garage is filled with Lily’s old toys and various family nicknacks anyway.
>Lily…
>She’s the reason you’re sitting out here instead of destressing in front of the idiot box on your comfortable couch.
>She’s been such a handful lately.
>Of course, you’ve had your difficulties before.
>Her ‘rebellious teen’ phase had given you more than a few grey hairs
>But this latest round of behavior, on top of your wife’s…
*BZZ* *BZZ*
>A text message wakes you from your reverie and you check your phone.
>”When r u planning on getting home?”
>You sigh, shutting off the radio before swinging open the driver’s side door.
>You maneuver your way out of the undersized vehicle, stretching as you go. Its former soviet-union creators definitely didn’t design it with a man your height in mind.
>Some might call you a big guy. You have an easy response for that line.
>You close the door and walk to your front door like a condemned man to the electric chair.
>Taking one last look at the sunlit yards and houses surrounding you, you resign yourself and open the door.
>You’re greeted by the sounds and smells of your wife, Julia, cooking.
>Smells like indian tonight.
>”Anon is that you?” comes her voice from the kitchen.
>You loosen your tie and rest your briefcase on the entryway counter before responding.
“Yeah, I’m home. Whatever you’re cooking smells nice.”
>The sounds of padded feet approaching stop you in your tracks as their Lynx owner turns the corner.
>”Heya Dad! How was work?”
>There she is. The reason for all this stress; a sweetly smiling Lynx anthro in a grey hoodie and plaid skirt.
“Hi Lily. Never better.”
>You brusquely push past her, ignoring her faltering smile and disappointed pout.
>You walk into your living room. The kitchen is separated by a low bar counter, over which you can see your wife adding chopped chicken to curry.
>She turns to you and gives you a frustrated glare, jerking her head back toward Lily. You throw up your hands exasperatedly just before the Lynx trails into the room.
>You sit on the recliner, sighing and releasing the stress of the work day before you try again.
“So… How was school, sweetie?”
>Your wife hums appreciatively while your adopted daughter gushes about her art classes and high school friends’ antics, treading over to the couch. It’s opposite you with the back to the kitchen.
>”And then Jenny was so embarrassed that she, like, ran out and Mike had to go the rest of the day with sauce all over his shirt!”
>You give an encouraging smile and nod, pulling out your phone and checking the news.
>”Oh that poor Michael, he’s the nice dog that got cut from the tennis team right?” your wife chimes in from the kitchen.
>Your daughter turns to look at her, draping her arms over the back of the couch. “Yeah! He’s such a clutz. I have no idea what she sees in him.”
>Her short tail lifts her skirt as she leans forward onto her knees, revealing striped pink and white cotton panties wrapped tightly around her ample butt.
>You quickly look back down at your phone, blood rushing to your face.
>God fucking damnit what is wrong with you.
>This has been going on for weeks now. You’d swear she was doing it on purpose if you hadn’t raised her from a cub.
>That’s your little girl over there, and Julia is just around the corner. Get a hold of yourself.
>”Honey?”
>You look up, startled from your shameful contemplation.
>Your wife and daughter are both looking at you, one from over the counter and the other from her now sitting position on the couch.
“Sorry, I wasn’t listening. What was it?”
>Your daughter giggles before lifting a paw up onto the couch, resting her arm on her knee and her chin on her arm. The result is, of course, that her skirt is completely lifted once more revealing those slim legs and tight undergarments.
>You look your wife directly in the eye, not daring to look away for fear of glancing at the forbidden fruit.
>It’s just been so long, if only Julia would— 
>”Lily wanted to know if you are going to make it to her class’s art show.” 
“Oh. I, uh, yeah, sure. When is it?”
>”It’s at 6:00 this monday, right sweetie?” she glances down to the Lynx, causing your eyes to automatically follow.
>Directly into view of the cat, legs now completely spread and back arched tantalizingly as she looks directly up and behind her at her mother.
>Her small breasts are pressed firmly against the front of her jacket but even still they barely show, the cloth defeating their meager weight.
>”Yeah, I think that’s right.” She assumes a more natural posture and looks back down to you. You fight to keep your ears from burning as she stares happily into your eyes.
>You think you catch the barest hint of a satisfied smirk but it’s gone before you know it.
“I, ah, yes I can do that.”
>Julia hums happily, turning around and continuing to cook. Lily continues to stare at you, the slightest grin gracing her face as her ears flick about.
“I’m going to go take a nap,” you declare.
>You stand up and turn to leave, subtly adjusting your pants as you do so, and head back to your room.
>”Bye Dad!” Lily shouts from behind you, and you simply grunt in response. 
>You can hear your wife start to talk to her as you leave, likely excusing you for your after-work surliness.
>You love her but she can be so oblivious sometimes.
>You’ve talked to her many times about Lily’s odd behaviour but every time she just dismisses it.
>’She’s at that age, she’ll be bringing home boys from school soon.’
>It doesn’t help that the bedroom situation with her has been… Rough.
>Probably better described as nonexistent.
>Every time you try to initiate she complains about a headache, or some appointment she has early in the morning, or that she’s just not ‘in the mood’.
>It’s been months now and you’re certain you wouldn’t be having these worrying feelings for Lily otherwise.
>The door creaks as you push it closed behind you and drop into bed, grunting lightly as you free your burgeoning erection from its fabric prison.
>You don’t get many opportunities to relieve yourself between work and your wife’s aloofness in bed. You have to take every chance you get to be alone in your room.
>You use your phone to browse a porn website you used to use before you married, putting on the first video it displays and making sure your volume is silenced.
>It’s some anthro dog breed being rubbed down by a ‘masseuse’ that’s obviously groping their tits and ass.
>Whatever works.
>You’re a few minutes in and you’re going for speed. You can feel the edge nearing, but as you approach you’re startled by a series of knocks on the door.
“What?” you practically shout, throwing a blanket over yourself and the tissues you had prepared.
>The handle turns and the door cracks open. Lily pokes her head in, nose twitching as she sniffs the air.
>”Mom says dinner’s ready. What were you doing in here?”
“Taking a nap. I’ll be out in a few minutes, okay?”
>The Lynx is wearing an uncharacteristically zoned-out expression and doesn’t leave, instead staring at you and continuing to sniff.
“Lily, go eat. I’ll be out in a bit.”
>That seems to wake her up and she turns smartly, closing the door behind her.
>Your orgasm is pretty much ruined but you’re still hard as a rock. Maybe you can get there again.
>You start trying again but somehow the image of your daughter’s spread legs and arched back keeps popping up, forcing you to stop and berate yourself.
>Just as you’re about to finish again another series of knocks sends you into a panic.
>”Anon come on, don’t make us all wait.” Julia speaks through the closed door before pacing away, shoes clicking on tile.
>You curse before stuffing yourself back into your khakis and adjusting as best you can. It’s going to be a long night.

===========================

>You are Lily, a very bad and very horny Lynx.
>Oh my god.
>He was totally doing it in there. The smell was amazing.
>You really hope he was thinking about you.
>Maybe you should give him some pictures to help…
>You rub your thighs together under the table. You can hear your mom approaching, and your dad’s muffled frustration through the door.
>You’re amazed sometimes by what your human family thinks is ‘too quiet to hear’.
>Mom sits across from you, rolling her eyes at her husband’s rudeness.
>Your parents’ door opens and Dad trudges down the hall, looking miserable.
>He pointedly ignores you as he sits across from the wall, at the ‘head’ of the small square furnishing.
>The scent of coitus interruptus permeates the room but neither of your parents seem to notice.
>If there were any other anthros around it would incredibly awkward.
>You sneak a glance around the table at his crotch between bites of your curry and rice.
>There’s an obvious bulge running from his groin down his left pant leg a few inches.
>You bite your lip. That’s so fucking hot.
>”So Lily, what piece are you most excited to show off?”
“Hmm? Oh, well I guess I did a pretty sweet portrait of my friend Janey.”
>Mom hums happily, “What did you use? Watercolor or oil, or is it a sketch?”
>You ‘accidentally’ touch your paw to Dad’s shoe under the table and he quickly pulls it back.
“We’re doing acrylic right now, so it’s a painting. It looks awesome.”
>Mom nods and smiles, completely oblivious to your continued under-the-table fidgeting.
>Somehow that gets you ever hotter, her being right there while you think about and tease her man.
>You slip a hand under the table and trace it along your lips through your panties.
>A purr escapes your lips before you can stop it, causing both your parents to look at you.
>You quickly shovel another bite of curry into your mouth.
“Ifs reawly goof, Mom,” you choke through bites while continuing to rub and purr.
>She smiles warmly, laughing. “Why don’t you ever say anything like that?” she turns to Dad.
>He gives her a confused look, “It’s great. Your food is always great.”
>Mom looks nonplussed at that, huffing. “Lily tells me without being asked.”
>Your dad looks thoroughly uncomfortable with this new direction of conversation.
>You almost feel a little bit bad.
>Dad just gives a shrug and continues eating before changing the subject.
>”So did you see that Russian oligarch Roman Abearmovich got Israeli citizenship? Instantly the richest man in the country.”
>Mom looks slightly irked by the dodge but chimes in with her own political analysis.
>Ugh, you hate it when they start talking about this kinda crap. So boring.
>Instead you settle for taking another peek.
>Looks like he’s calmed down again, unfortunately.
>A few more minutes of agonizing conversation and eating later, you’ve excused yourself.
>You know that Dad always sits in his recliner and watches the news after dinner, so you can prepare to give him a more interesting show to watch.
>Walking into your room you strip off your jacket leaving only your light blouse. You also grab Dad’s old GameBoy.
>He’d given it to you ages ago and you’ve been playing Combat Tactics for a while now.
>No one at school knows but you’re kinda into that kind of stuff; you have to hide it from your friends to maintain your popularity.
>Not Dad though. He knows you so well.
>He’s so much better than the boys at school…

===========================

>Finally, you can take a load off.
>Having finished dinner you’re now in your favorite chair as Julia cleans dishes.
>She’s an excellent wife in a lot of respects.
>But lately…
>More horrible news blares over the TV. Of course it’s on FoX.
>You only really watch it because Julia doesn’t like it when you retreat to the bedroom immediately, and everything else is too much to think about after work.
>You’d rather zone out to the sounds of droning midwestern accents and occasional ‘newsflash’ trumpets.
>From the corner of your eye you catch Lily padding into the room, now in a blouse and that same skirt.
>She lies down on her stomach on the couch, flicking on your old gameboy.
>Good to see her acting normally again—
>Aaand her skirt’s ridden up onto her back by way of her stubby tail. Her fuzzy ass is now completely exposed, save what’s under her panties.
>Which, you note, she’s changed. She’s now wearing featureless snow-white ones. A fact you immediately regret knowing.
>You do your best to keep your eyes on the news, but they betray you as she takes on ever more adventurous poses.
>After a few minutes she’s on her back holding the console above her head, one leg bent up lifting her skirt while her small breasts show through her blouse.
>She’s clearly not wearing a bra, though you’re not sure if she ever does.
>A few minutes later she’s playing one-handed, the other is lazily gliding over her chest as she purrs up a storm.
>You hate to admit it but it’s definitely having an effect on you.
>You force your eyes in the direction of the TV, praying that your bulge isn’t too noticeable.
>After a few minutes of success, you’re defeated again when the lynx moans lightly.
>Looking over she’s still on her back, though her paw is running heavily over her skirt now.
>Okay, enough is enough. Time to put a stop to this.
“Alright, just what exactly do you think you’re doing?”
>”Hmm?” she hums innocently, grinning, “I’m just playing some games Dad. What’s up?”
>She hasn’t stopped fucking rubbing herself.
>Julia has turned around by now, looking over at you. Lily is hidden from her by the bar and the back of the couch.
“Cut it out. If you want to do that you can go to your room.”
>”Anon…” comes the threatening voice of your wife from the kitchen, “*our* daughter can play her games in the living room if she wants.”
>Goddamnit. You’ve been through this before.
>If you explicitly tell her what Lily’s doing she’ll be disgusted that you’re sexualizing your daughter, and Lily will play innocent.
>If you say nothing the lynx will just get bolder.
>You opt to continue fruitlessly trying to ignore the display occurring on your couch, which of course just makes her purr and pose all the harder.
>Some time later Julia is sitting with Lily on the couch, talking about some clothing brand.
>Lily for her part has toned things down, but she’s still angling herself at you and stretching her legs provocatively.
>None of which does Julia seem to notice.
>It’s getting later by now; the sky has darkened considerably. Though that could be caused by the rainstorm that’s started outside.
>Tomorrow’s a saturday so you don’t have to get up for work but adhering to a schedule for so long has eliminated your ability to stay up.
>Not to mention neither your brain nor your dick can handle staying out here much longer.
>You get up and head to the bedroom, leaving the two girls to chat it up without you.
>You get ready for bed before lying down. It’s pointless to try to relieve yourself again, Julia will be here any minute.
>A few minutes of browsing on your phone later your door opens and Julia steps through, heading to the bathroom.
>She comes back out in a light nightgown and crawls into the other side of the bed.
>”Why are you being so tough on her?”
>You sigh, even if you were certain you aren’t just crazy and seeing things that weren’t there she still wouldn’t believe you.
“I just… I’m having trouble dealing with her growing up, I guess.”
>”Oh, honey…” she turns to you, laying a hand on your shoulder, “every dad is like that. You just can’t handle the idea that some day some boy will take her from us.”
“That’s not exactly what I meant.”
>She gives you a patronizing look that screams ‘I know that’s exactly what you meant’. 
>You two take a moment to lie like this. You in your boxers and sleeping shirt, her in that thin little nightgown.
>Fuck it. Who dares wins.
>You lean over and press your mouth into her neck, kissing her.
>She doesn’t fuss, so you pull her in, angling for her mouth.
>Just as you’re approaching she pushes you off, turning and scooting away.
>You huff half angrily, half out of disappointment.
>”I’m tired.”
“From what?”
>Oh no. You wish you hadn’t said that.
>”What’s that supposed to mean? You think being a mom is easy?”
“I didn’t say that.”
>”You know if I wanted to start working again I could get my old job back. Then *you* could pack lunches and shop for groceries and pick her up and all this crap.”
>You try to put on your most de-escalating tone,
“I know it’s hard. I know you can still work. I’m happy that you wanted to stay at home, really. I didn’t mean it like that. I’m just pent up.”
>She humphs, not speaking to you. Great.
>Another long night of dissatisfaction.

===========================

>A peal of thunder echoes through the window, waking you with a start.
>The storm has gotten worse. Rain bounces noisily off the roof and ground outside, covering the night with a blanket of white noise.
>The room flashes with lightning. It’s late; the lightning must be a few miles away.
>You lay back down and try to get back to sleep, but you’re interrupted by hesitant knocking at the bedroom door.
>You grunt and sit up.
“What is it?”
>Lily pipes up from the opposite side of the door, “I… I can’t sleep. Can I come in there with you guys?”
>Unbelievable. She’d always had her phobias, you’d even called her Scaredy-Cat through her childhood.
>But being unable to sleep through a thunderstorm at her age is just too much.
“Absolutely no—”
>”Yes, come on in sweetie.” your wife chimes in. Apparently she had been awake, too.
>You’re not sure if she’s doing it because she genuinely thinks  you’re being too tough on Lily or if she’s just trying to get back at you.
>The door opens and Lily slips inside hesitantly, closing it behind her. Julia has turned on her bedside light, much to your tired chagrin.
>The feline pads up to the bed; she’s wearing her old set of pokemon pajamas.
>You can feel the bed shift as she crawls up between your wife and yourself, pulling back the covers and sliding in next to you.
>Julia turns the light back off and Lily shifts and turns a bit before finally settling, lying on her side facing you.
>A few minutes pass and the lynx’s breathing calms. Guess she really was scared.
>You drift off to sleep again, hopefully for the last time tonight.
...
>You’re awoken by something moving in the bed.
>You glance at Julia’s bedside clock; it’s been half an hour since you fell asleep.
>Confused, you lie still as the bed continues to jostle lightly.
>It seems Lily still hasn’t quite gotten comfortable.
>The sudden sensation of a fuzzy shoulder touching your arm gives you a start, causing her to stop dead.
>You decide not to break the silence, choosing to try and get back to sleep as soon as possible.
>You’re probably just overthinking a benign situation.
>It seems that may have been a mistake, however.
>A few seconds later Lily’s back on the move, scooting ever so slightly closer to you.
>First you feel her head as she rests it on your arm, rubbing her muzzle against your exposed skin.
>Her whiskers tickle slightly, but you repress the urge to move. If you just play dead maybe she’ll calm down and just let you get some sleep.
>Apparently she has different plans.
>You flinch at the sensation of her hands touching your chest.
>She pauses for a moment, making sure you haven’t woken up, before she continues to explore.
>Her hands drift further down until they reach the hem of your shirt, which she lifts up to feel your bare abs.
>Slowly she schooches further into you, purring ever so slightly as her pajama-covered legs wrap gently around your thigh and leg.
>Her head is now resting in the crook of your shoulder and she’s sniffing your chest intensely.
>For some reason you can’t divine, you decide to have a sniff too.
>Her lavender shampoo is the first thing to reach your nose, but there’s something… wilder there, too.
>She arches her back heavily, removing some of the unwelcome pressure on your chest—
>Only to put a far more unwelcome pressure on your left thigh as she pushes her groin into you through her pajama bottoms, her stubby tail flicking about under the sheets.
>She’s purring madly now, grinding herself against your leg and nuzzling your shoulder while her paws rub against your chest under your shirt.
>How she thinks you’re supposed to sleep through this you have no idea.
>You’re faced with a dilemma.
>If you say anything you’ll almost certainly wake Julia, and she’d take the lynx’s side on whatever the hell she’s doing anyway.
>Lord knows what she’d say in this situation considering she’s already blamed you for every other time the lynx has come on to you.
>On the other hand…
>On the other hand you’re pent up as hell and you’ve got a beautiful girl literally grinding against you.
>Somehow, the disgust you’d felt so often before isn’t coming at such full force.
>Maybe it’s the raging hardon you’re sporting or maybe it’s the fact that your daughter has started lightly moaning as she slips one of her hands into her pajama bottoms to rub against herself under the covers.
>Whatever the reason, your head is completely clouded by now.
>Thoughts of divorce and the legality of what you’re about to do go by the wayside, replaced with the musky scent that now permeates the room and the purrs of a certain cat.
>Feigning shifting in your sleep, you turn to lie on your side facing her.
>She, of course, freezes instantly. But as you continue to lie there, she begins to become more adventurous again.
>The hand that was groping your pecs now slides down, snaking its way through your boxers and resting on your rock-hard member.
>The cat hums appreciatively, running her pads along your length as she presses her chest into yours.
>The sensation of soft pads and small breasts pressing into you is too much, you have to act.
>You move suddenly, wrapping one arm around her back pinning her against yourself as the other pets her head.
>She lets out a muffled “eep”, muzzle locked firmly against your shirt under the blankets.
“You’ve been really hard to deal with lately, you know that?” you whisper directly into her ear, thrusting your manhood against her hand.
>The lynx whimpers happily at that, and you can feel her rubbing herself harder.
“Go back to your room. Now.”
>That elicits a disappointed groan but the cat reluctantly does as you say. Slowly she slides out of bed, careful not to wake your wife.
>You wait until Lily leaves before making sure Julia is still asleep, laying still for a few minutes and listening to her breaths.
>Are you seriously going to do this?
>Somehow you already know the answer to that question.
>Without another thought you shift out of bed too, watching for any sign of movement from your wife as you rise and leave the room.
>You pace to your daughter’s room, opening the door softly and stepping inside.
>Her light is on, illuminating the various videogame and band posters and stuffed animals scattered about.
>The lynx herself is sitting on the edge of her bed, looking ashamed and ready to be lectured.
>It’s a strange look considering her pajama bottoms are clearly soaked through.
>You stand there, arms crossed, looking down at her as she avoids your gaze.
“Do you know what all your teasing has been doing to me? To my relationship with your mother?”
>She whines, “No, I’m… I’m sorry, I just really like you and—”
>You pace up to her quickly, tilting her head up with a hand and leaning in to kiss her deeply.
>She moans her surprise into your mouth and you take the opportunity to slip your tongue in, probing her sharp teeth.
>It’s been so fucking long since you’ve done this with Julia.
>Lily pushes you away, leaning back. “Wha.. you really wanna do this?”
>You chuckle, pressing yourself into her and sinking her into the girly covers on her bed.
“I think we’re a little past that, scaredy-cat.”
>She moans as you buck your hips into her, wrapping her arms around your neck and clinging on.
>You slip out of her embrace, sliding down to her lower body and pulling down her pants, revealing her steaming sex.
>She wasn’t wearing any panties, you notice.
“Have you done this before?”
>”N-no, just toys…”
>You give a smile as she blushes hard.
“That’s a good girl” you say before giving her entrance an exploratory lick.
>Lily arches her back and shudders, sitting up and grabbing onto your head for dear life.
>Encouraged, you bury your face deeper into her, probing with your tongue until you find her small clit.
>You give it a light nibble and she moans, squeezing her lithe legs around your head and bucking into you.
>You hang in, breathing once through your nose before plunging in again and redoubling your efforts.
>Her legs start to shake and you can feel her contract around your tongue as she begins a loud caterwaul.
>You stop still, letting her cry dissipate discontentedly as she grinds herself into your chin.
“You’ll wake her up if you yell like that,” you say, slipping a ring finger into her snatch as you rise up and silence her with a deep kiss.
>You go for broke as her cries reverberate through your mouth, fingering her past the edge and letting her ride out her orgasm on your digit.
>The small cat clutches you tightly as if she’s afraid you’ll leave her, clamping down on your finger like a vice.
>You break the kiss and remove the finger, offering it to her.
>She hesitates for a moment before licking it clean greedily.
>Her mouth closes around the digit, suckling on it before releasing it with a wet *smack*.
>You don’t think you’ve ever been harder in your life than you are in this moment.
>The bed creaks as you sit down and push her off onto the ground, earning a surprised yip.
>She turns to face you, by which time your boxers are off and you’re standing at attention.
>A throaty purr rises from her throat as she rises up to approach it, “I’ve been waiting for this…”
>You have no idea why, but you reply;
“Me too kitten.”
>She hums happily and licks you sloppily, grabbing hold of your base tightly.
“Ah, stop.” she looks disappointed into your eyes but holds still, rough tongue still halfway up your member. “You’ve really never done this before, have you?”
>The cat lets out an indignant mewl into your meat, huffing embarrassedly.
>You grab her paw, slowly easing her grip until it’s a pleasant pressure.
“Okay, you’ve got a rough tongue and some sharp teeth. It’s fine going in,” you illustrate your point by grabbing the back of her head and pushing it down on your cock a few inches, earning you a choked gurgle. “But coming out kind of hurts, so you’re going to have to let up the pressure in that direction.”
>You bring her head back up and she removes the pressure of her tongue from you, letting you slide out easily.
“Same goes for licking. Down is fine, up needs to be softer.”
>She nods excitedly and goes back to licking obediently before taking your head into her mouth and pushing down.
>She reaches the point you pushed her to, parked about halfway down her snout, and continues further with a grunt.
>The sensation of her throat convulsing around you sends you reeling, lightly twitching and groaning.
>Lily seems pleased by the noises, reaching a hand up to cup your sack even as she softly swirls her tongue over you.
>You’re getting close to the edge when she stops, removing you from her mouth to your dissatisfaction.
>You angle a glare her way, “I’ve been waiting so long, so… Let’s, ya’know.”
>A grin creeps its way onto your face. She’s fucking adorable, as always.
“Let’s what? What do you want?”
>She stutters a bit, tail raised and swinging about like a club.
>”L-let’s, uhm, you know… Let’s do it.”
“Do what?” you feign ignorance, scooting back onto the bed.
>”UGH. DAD. Let’s fuck already!”
>She pounces on you, bed creaking as she slathers thick saliva over your neck and face.
>This wasn’t exactly what you expected from the timid cat.
>She growls when you try to shift her off you, pushing her small but surprisingly strong frame into you.
>You stop and let her take control, laying back and running your hands down her sides.
>She rewards you with a low purr and grabs your dick, angling it into her entrance and dropping down agonizingly slowly.
>She grabs your sides, claws digging painfully into your skin as she howls in pain and pleasure, taking you inch my inch into herself.
>She bottoms out before she reaches your base, groaning painfully as she tries futilly to push further.
>You reach up with a hand to support her ass, stopping her from going too far. You run the other under the pajama top she’s still wearing, fondling her small tits.
>”Fffuuuck, you’re so big Daddy.”
>Not even a day ago hearing that would’ve appalled you, but now it drives you wild. You flip her over, taking control and drawing your dick almost all the way back out.
>You slam home, being sure not to go deeper than she can take, and start up a rhythm.
>For her part Lily matches your speed, humping against you needily.
>She’s so tight it’s almost painful, her hot tunnel far more muscular than any human woman could ever be.
>It’s obvious her body isn’t designed to take a human-sized partner.
>But she seems to enjoy it, crying out as she shakes and clenches onto you again.
>You’re almost there too.
>You pick up the speed, fucking her raw now. Her claws have cut deep gashes in her covers at this point and you’re not sure if you’ve made too much noise.
>You hilt against your daughter’s womb one last time, humping the wall as you release inside of her.
>She reaches up and holds you tightly against her chest, giveing you one last kiss as you continue to come, letting out months of frustration in a single moment.
>You collapse beside her, panting heavily.
>”Oh my god,” she breathes, “that was fucking amazing.”
>You snort, looking down at her with mock anger;
“You watch your language young lady.”
>She gives a cute giggle and nuzzles into your neck, pulling her tattered covers over the two of you.
>”I love you, Dad.”
“Love you too, hun.”
>You fall asleep like that, not a care in the world as you lie in each other’s arms under the blankets.
…
>You wake up to the sound of knocking on the door.
>Confused, you start to get up before you realize you’re not in your bed.
>Oh god, what did you do last night?
>The door opens and Julia steps in, “Hey sweetie have you seen your father around—”
>She catches sight of the two of you in bed, Lily’s arm draped across your chest as she slowly awakes.
>The Blankets over you are torn to shreds and soaked in several places.
>”Uhh… Mom, it’s… I was...”
>”Aww, I knew you’d get along with her eventually. You two are adorable, wait here while I get the camera!”
>You let out a bewildered grunt as she skips out of the room, leaving the door open behind her.
>Lily turns to you as if to ask, ‘what’s going on?’, and you merely shrug and pull up your boxers under the sheets in response.
>The cat pulls up her pajama bottoms too just before your wife bursts back into the room, now carrying an old DSLR.
>”Okay okay, pretend you’re still sleeping! I’m going to write; ‘Dad sleeps in scaredy-cat’s bed through thunderstorm’ and use them in the Christmas cards!”
>You smile with relief and Lily lets out a surprised gulp before laying her head back down on your chest and draping her arm over you once more.
>Julia snaps a few pictures before letting the camera hang on its strap.
>”Honestly, I was starting to worry you two were never going to get along. But look at you! And she was so scared she ruined her old blankets, too.”
>Lily blushes furiously as you remove the blankets, striding out of bed confidently in your shirt and boxers.
>”Alright, you two get up and I’ll go make some breakfast.”
>You give your daughter one last sultry look before pacing out of her room, getting dressed for the day.
…
>It’s been about a month since you started this ‘thing’ with your daughter.
>Somehow it seems your wife is oblivious to the point of ridiculousness.
>She’s often nearly caught the two of you in the act, only to invent some fantastical explanation of her own accord.
>You’re sitting on the couch right now watching the news with your daughter on your lap playing on her nintendo.
>Julia is cooking behind the two of you and keeping up a casual conversation.
>”And that’s when she told me her son was going to State U. Hah! So much for the wonder-parents now.”
>You laugh along with her, as your daughter shifts in your lap, bringing your cock almost all the way out of her before burying it inside once more.
>Her skirt rides low around your groin, covering up the action as the sounds of the TV and her game drown out the noises of your lovemaking.
>Not that your wife is looking, anyway.
