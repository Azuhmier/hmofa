>October 18th 1989
>You're an American transfer detective working in Japan on a big case
>Apparently they've been having trouble so they wanted help from overseas
>You've been brought in to sabotage the Miss Kitty drug operation
>She has a major connection in the drug ring staying at a hotel in one of her casino's and the Tokyo police department want evidence of him staying there.
>And it's rumoured Miss Kitty is staying there tonight as well
>You're undercover as a big shot poker player from the states
>You arrive and walk around getting use to your surroundings
>But you just can't find the target or Miss Kitty anywhere
>You can't ask the staff they're all crooked too
>They would be immediately be suspicious of you and would throw you out
>Plus, it seems that you're the only human in the casino
>You start to get bored waiting at the bar and decide to kill some time
>You play some poker for a while and start to win a few games
>Eventually the staff notice and you get brought into the VIP area
>The VIP room is much smaller but it's certainly more glamorous
>If anybody knew who you were right now they'd tear you to shreds
>you see Miss Kitty; Head of the Yakuza, watching you in her clique of friends at the bar
>She watches you walk to the poker table with her ruby red  eyes like you're her new prey for tonight
>Does she now something?. Impossible. You're just being paranoid, must be all the hot air.

>You play some poker with some so called big shots untill you have won a hefty gamble and have a crowd of impressed players.
>Miss Kitty comes over dressed to kill with her traditional Chinese red dress that goes straight down to her legs that accentuates her legs and hips.
>You can tell just by the look of pattern and it's velvet like fabric, she's certainly made a lot of money in either business she does.
>"Ahh~, hello there, a human in *my* casino... we don't have many of your type come in here...very unusual, however, I welcome all to the Cathouse. I am Miss Kitty; O ai dekite ureshÄ«".
>She leans down and kisses your hand like royalty 
>She speaks perfectly good English to your surprise
>But her mannerisms feel...off.
>It's like she's playing it up for someone, was she playing up for you?.
>"Thanks, I'm here traveling from the states and just happen to be in the area and wanted to place a few bets, you don't get a lot of humans here?, Is this place not tourist friendly or somethin'.
>She doesn't buy your act, and gives you an unamused glare.
>"Uh-huh, come with me please, I'd like to talk about... your "poker face".
>This must be it you thought, you follow her to the hotel side of the casino, higher and higher untill you reach the penthouse suite.

>You finally reach the room, to your surprise Miss Kitty pours out a drink while you look out the window at toyko night skyline. 
>"I know who you are Mr Anon; I've heard about your arrival here for a few months now. Seems the boys in the TPD can't capture a poor little kitten like me so now they bring in the Western dogs...I'm quite flattered really. 
>She knew your name, you must have been ratted out by a mole in the TPD but who?
>Maybe they thought a Westerner would be easily corrupted or to double cross so they decided to jump the gun and cut off a for-seeable liability , you wait for her to pull a gun out, but instead she hands you a glass of whiskey.
>"I heard you Americans are lovers of whiskey. Here."
>She hands you the drink and clinks your drink
>"Kampai". She downs her glass of whiskey in one go, you take a few nervous sips of the whiskey in case it's been tampered with.
>she takes your drink from your hand and puts it on the table.
>"I have a little proposition for you, Mr Anon".
>She walks away from the drink cabinet, purposely swaying her hips as she slinks across the room
>" Do you know how hard it is for a woman-let alone an animal person like myself to make a name for herself in this business, the years I've put into, the lives I've ruined all for it to slip away, just because an unsavory character *just* happened to be staying here tonight?. No, if I'm going down it's certainly not because of that knuckle dragger like him, I'll stay in this game no matter what I have to do so...you let me continue my organization and in return~".

>She walks over to the bed and slips of her light red dress
>It falls to the floor graciously freeing her plump breasts and displaying her luscious curves
>"I'll let you fuck the most powerful woman in all of Japan".
>You feel awkward and your voice fails you, but you just stare at her slender body, such a figure.
>But you can't, you have a duty, where's your honor. If they knew if you'd say yes you'd be on the first plane out of here.
>"I'm sorry, I can't, I have a job to do. You're a crime boss, you've killed and ruined people's lives, how could I possibly-."
>She walks over pressing her large chest against you
>You try with all your might not to look down
>"Why not detective?,they don't care about you, you haven't even been here long enough to know about my doings in this country, you shouldn't care about that, and what about you're so called officers in the police hmm?, they knew full well that I knew you a cop and yet they made you walk in right into the tigers den, I would never treat you so poorly, don't they respect you?, Such poor treatment of someone so... intuitive and not to mention brave for coming here... come on detective, why not give in into your natural desires just you, and me...together, is that so wrong~."
>She starts to slowly kiss your neck softly as her arms link around your neck, her soft fluffy fur warming your chest as low purring hums from hers
>She looks so intimidating with her Ruby red eyes but she's being so gentle like as if she was your lover
>She was being so warm, so inviting...
>"Come on~...I want you, let me take care of you."
>It's too much, her curves, her feminine charm, without thinking your lips are pressed against her's
>You explore her body with your hands as she unbuckles your belt freeing your slowly rising member.
>She takes her hand and strokes your cock while kissing your neck and lips
>You felt amazing, you pick her up like a newly wed to the bed and lye on top of her in a missionary position.
>"There we go, what are you waiting for...take me already~."
>She cooes sultry and submissively
>You push it inside her deep, her tight walls clenched your member squeezing it
>She let's out a moan at the feeling of such pleasure
>"Aah~ bigger in America I see~." She says playfully as you get into a rhythm rocking your hips inwards and out
>You start pumping harder and more agressive
>Any morels or principals you had were thrown out the window and you couldn't care less.
>You mind forgot the image of powerful crime boss
>All you cared was having your way with her like a cheap hooker in a hotel room
>You start to get close, you press down and lye on top of her with a few last thrusts of your stamina left
>She locks her legs around you, squeezing you tighter and pushing you in deeper pressing you closer to her chest and a whisker away from her face
>"Cum inside, it's okay, let it all out in me".
>You burts your seed inside her, and it drips onto the bed, you stay holding her tight for a few seconds, both breathing heavily before rolling off
>Miss Kitty gets off the bed like she was just resting and not having coitus
>"You can stay here tonight detective, consider it a token of my appreciation...and not to mention your "impressive poker skills", but after that you're going to tell them you found nothing here out of the ordinary, understood?".
>Her words are cold and monotone
>How foolish to think this was anything but blackmail
>Her soft words words now broken glass shattering the reality that's sinking in of what you've done
>Your actions suddenly sink in and you sit at the edge of the bed feeling guilty about what you've done
>How can you even lie to your peers
>They have a mole so she'll tell them what happened anyway
>"Understood"
>That's all you can say, looking at the bed avoiding eye contact shamefully
>She let's out a soft chuckle while she slinks herself towards the exit in a triumphant manner
>"Don't be so hard on yourself Anon..."
>She puts on her dress and brushes her self down looking proper before opening the hotel room door
>"The house *always* wins."
