	The sun hitting your face means it’s time to wake up.  Prying your eyes open, you find yourself alone, the Mollys had left your bed while you were still asleep, your bed still crumpled where they lay next to you.   Oh god, you are sore.  Xiao Yu’s escapades are catching up to you.  Still, can’t turn down awesome sex like this.  Getting up, you stretch yourself out before showering off the accumulated doberman hairs, dander, and caked on dog drool.  The Mollys aren’t in the kitchen, but your grandmother is.  Not good.  She can’t even remember she turned on the stove a minute after doing it.  The Mollys are normally here doing it.  If you’re grandma’s out of bed, that means they aren’t doing their job!  Where the hell are they?
    “Grandma!  You shouldn’t be here.”
    “Why the hell not?” she shoots back.  “I’m thirsty and I want tea!”
    “I’ll get you your tea grandma, alright?  Just go back to bed.”
    “I don’t want to go to bed, I have to take a shit.”
    “Then go to the bathroom grandma and I’ll get your tea.”
    “Fine, make sure to add ice and honey.  Where’s the shitter?”
    “Right next to your room grandma.”
	“And where’s my room?”
	“Down the hall to the right.”
	“So right to my right.  Fine.”
	You sigh as you set up your coffee maker to just dispense hot water, and shut the stove off.  While the machine starts boiling its water store, you search for the Uplifts.  “Molly?” you call out.  No answer.  You reach their bedroom, door closed.  “Molly!” you call through the door.  Still no reply.  You push open the door and find...no one.  Unless.
“Molly, come out of the closet.” You say, stamping your foot.  The closet door creaks open, and calm Molly meekly shuffles out, head down, wearing one of your T-Shirts, fabric stretched so that it covers her to her knees.  “All of you.” you command.  Next comes competitive Molly, dressed in a tank top and sweatpants. Lastly comes assertive Molly, dressed in one of your button up shirts, draped over a pair of white panties, trying as hard as she can to avoid your gaze.
“You know where I saw grandma this morning?”
    They fidget around, and mumble an incoherent reply.  Fuck sake, you really don’t want to deal with this shit in the morning, especially feeling like you do.  “Okay then” you grunt.  “She’s heading to the bathroom now.  One of you get her morning tea, and the other two help her back to bed.  She seems a little better this morning so she shouldn’t be too difficult.  Can you please do that for me?” 
	The Mollys don’t say anything. Competitive and Assertive leave wordlessly, competitive Molly breaking into a jog to the kitchen while assertive heads for the bathroom, holding her breath.  Grandmother has this amazing ability to drop shits that smell like hell’s outhouse.  Submissive Molly finally looks at you, opening her mouth to say something, then closing it.  Then opening it again, and closing it again.  Then she finally finds her voice.  “I’m sorry Anon.  A-are you going to see the panda again?”
	That’s out of nowhere.  “Well I did promise to help her out this week so yeah.  I’m kind of stuck in this now.”
Submissive Molly slowly nods before giving you a quick hug.  “Come back soon Anon.” she whispers before she leave to deal with your grandmother.  Well at least it didn’t lead to an argument.  Small mercies and all that.  You grab a banana and head out the door.  You don’t remember but you think fruit like bananas helped with stamina in the bedroom or something.  Even so, it may be best to stock up on those StamUps for this week.  You’re gonna get quite a workout…
********************************************************************************************************************************
	Backpack filled with condoms, StamUps, bananas, and water, you tenaciously approach Xiao Yu’s room.  You barely tap on the door before she opens the door, wearing nothing but a very transparent négligée.  “Anon” she moans, big smile on her lips.  “How nice of you to drop by.  I was just getting ready to take a shower.” she tries to act coy, but she must have been waiting by the door for hours for you to arrive, given how quickly she answered.
	You push her back, stepping in, and closing the door with your foot.  You notice, she had scented candles lit...everywhere.  The blinds were drawn on her windows, and none of the lights were on.  “Shower huh?” you ask rhetorically.  Setting your bag down, you pull out a StamUp, it’s pretty clear she’s already in the mood.  Feeling a familiar sensation injecting into your neck, you flex your limbs as you undo your jacket.  “Okay, let’s get started.” you say once free of your jacket, pulling your shirt off and pushing out of your shoes.  Xiao Yu just gapes at you in confusion and arousal, put off by your ‘straight to business’ attitude but too horny to complain.
	“Well if you really want to get to the good part, I can’t complain” she smirks, undoing the string to the front of her 	underwear, if you can call it that, letting the see through fabric fall away as she  guides you to her bed.  Pushing you down, she straddles your legs and leans in, grabbing your hand and guiding it to her breasts.  You grab one of her fuzzy orbs, giving it a squeeze as you wrap your other arm around her.  Xiao Yu responds by meeting you halfway, pressing her lips to yours as her tongue pushes its way into your mouth, pressing against yours as her hands explore your body, one rubbing your hardening bulge in your pants, and another undoing your belt.  Her breathing gets faster as she undoes your button, grasping your pants sleeves with her toes and slowly pulling it off.  You have no idea what she did with her previous owner, but it’s like magic as she gets your pants down using only her feet, desire burning in your stomach as your hardon springs out of your boxer fly.  She gasps in your mouth, soft hand slowly wrapping around your shaft.  “Mmm, I’ve missed this” she breathes when she pulls away.  You try to get up, but she pushes you back down.  “Not yet” she says.  “Let me enjoy you.”
	She moves down, kissing your neck as she tightens her grip on your cock.  When she starts licking your chest her hand begins to slowly stroke your length. Her thumb begins to massage your crown as she moves to your nipples, tongue lapping and teeth nibbling at your sensitive nubs.  Already you find yourself nearing your climax, her warm hand on your dick feels like a soft glove, driving you nuts and she knows it.  Her tongue glides on your bare skin as she moves for your member.  Smiling, she positions her lips right above your reddened cock head.  She slips the head of your shaft into her mouth as she pulls down, slurping on your meat for a second before pulling back up, her hand moving in pace with her head along your length.  Then she does it again, and again, never too fast to send you over the top, not too slow to let you calm down.  You reach up to grasp her head, and she lightly slaps your hands away as she continues to work you over.  She’s setting the pace.  Not you.  Not now.  Your hands, with nothing to grab, clench her bedsheets as you involuntarily push up when she bobs down, your dick aching for the warmth of her mouth.  Then she lets go, flat stops.  Why?!
	Xiao Yu looks up at you, a teasing smile on her face.  “Oh no Anon, you aren’t coming into my hands.” she moans, hands moving to her breasts.  “No, I want that creamy man-stuff in me somewhere else.”
She pulls herself up, your cock standing painfully erect.  Again you reach down.  You have to nut!  You don’t need anything besides the bliss of release, but that bitch slaps your hand away again!  Fucking hell woman!  Xiao Yu enjoys your frustration as she slowly positions her sopping wet snatch against the underside of your dick. It feels like she rested your dick on a warm pillow, her wet vulva spreading open as she glides up your meatshaft until it’s kissing the entrance to her pussy.  She positions her feet on your hips, and her hands on your chest.  “Ready?” she asks.
	You don’t even get to reply.  She drops down, her cleft swallowing your cock, her inner walls squeezing around the sudden intruder.  And she pulls back up again, your cock now coated in her arousal, feeling suddenly cold outside her warm vagina, before Xiao Yu drops down again, forcing the air out of you every time she smashes into your pelvis.   You simply can’t take anymore! Ignoring her hands grasping at yours, you latch onto her hips, pushing her down as your cock twitches.
Hot seed pours straight into Xiao Yu, the panda milf shouting out in ecstasy as she feels you filling her, forming an 'o' with her mouth as she lets your orgasm trigger her own climax.  She grasps your hands for support as her legs shake, white seed and clear fluid leaking from your love seal.
	Xiao Yu slowly rises, up, putting a hand over her vulva as your softening member pops out of her hole.  "Oh I really missed you Anon" she leans down and plants a kiss on your dick.  "I missed this too."
	She leaves the room, giving your leg a pat before she goes.  A couple of minutes later, she returns with your bag, tossing you a water bottle as she grabs one herself.  "You thought of everything didn't you?"
	"Well it was pretty hard trying to get a glass of water yesterday with you sucking me off" you remark.
Xiao Yu sticks her tongue out.  "Don't act like you didn't like it." she teases before gulping down her bottle.  
True you did.  But it didn't stop you from being thirsty as fuck.  Even drinking water, Xiao Yu looks sexy, letting a small trickle of it dribble down her neck, soaking into her fur, slipping down between her pert bosom and down to her belly button.  Fuck you're getting hard again.  "Well I'm ready for another go if you are" you say, motioning your head to your stiffening cock.
	"Oh I'm ready for you Anon"  Xiao Yu smiles.  "I've been ready for a long time" she replies as she climbs back on the bed, brushing her vagina against your dick, her heat radiating from it.
	With no foreplay this time, she sinks back down onto you.
********************************************************************************************************************************
	The Mollys are glum.  Grandma is back in bed, and now they have the rest of the day to themselves.  Normally they'd spend this time plotting new ways to prank Anon, binge watch seasons of Contest of Thrones on Anon's account, masturbate to porn on their computer, steal Anon's clean laundry, dunk their heads and smell Anon's dirty laundry, or any number of things the kill time until Anon came home.  They didn't feel like doing anything today though.
	They gathered around the kitchen table, Submissive Molly idly fiddling with an empty cup, Assertive Molly tapping her finger, Competitive Molly tapping slightly faster.  They weren't saying anything to each other, but the same thing was on all their minds.
	'We're losing Anon.'
	"Alright since no one else is saying it" Competitive Molly states "I will.  What are we going to do about Anon?"
	"What can we do?" Submissive Molly shrugs
	"We can stop him from leaving tomorrow."
    "And just how are we supposed to do that Molly, tell him he can't go?"
    "Well I dunno, make up a reason!  I can't think of anything right now!"
    "You never think of anything!"
    "Uh hello?  I'm the one that erases our internet history so Anon doesn't know we watch porn!  You're welcome!"
    "Maybe that's why he doesn't notice us, you ever think of that?"
    "He's too nice to look at our computer.  We asked him for that laptop for our privacy remember? he'd never look at it unless we asked him to."
    "So you really don't do anything do you Molly?"
    "Hey don't blame me Molly!  Anon just gets annoyed with us because of all the pranks you pull on him!"
    "I didn't hear you disagree with me once!"
    "I was thinking it!  We were both thinking it!"
    "Actually I wasn't really thinking it, I was just hoping Anon wouldn't get hurt..."
    "Yeah and you think I can read your thoughts?!"
    "MOLLY!  SHUT THE FUCK UP" grandma yells from across the house.
    Assertive Molly jumps out of her chair in shock.  Meekly climbing back up into her seat she sighs.  "Sorry Molly."
    "I'm sorry too Molly."
    "So am I..."
    "You didn't do anything Molly, it's okay."
    "But we still don't know what to do about Anon."
    "You're right.  If we don't do something, that Bitchy Bear's going to steal Anon from us."
********************************************************************************************************************************
    “Fuck me” you breathe as you lie down on the kitchen floor “you are insatiable!”
    Xiao Yu lays on top of you, your latest orgasm leaking out of her pussy as your dick slowly softens and slips out, laying her head on your chest, hearing your heart beat.  “What can I say, humans are a huge turn on for me.”
    “How the fuck did we get out here again?” you ask.  The last four hours are just a haze of lusty, fluid filled sex and it all just blends together.
    “You forgot the petplay already Anon?” Xiao Yu chides, holding up the leash you attached to a pair of fuzzy handcuffs she was wearing.  “That was the best part.”
    You push yourself up, Xiao Yu hoisting herself off of you “I honestly prefer the stuff in the bedroom, tile floors have shitty support.” you grunt, getting the cricks out of your spine.  Xiao Yu fishes out the keys for her cuffs from you have no idea where, flexing her wrists as she frees herself.
    “You seem to be pretty experienced with this though Anon...um...anyone help you back home?” she tentatively asks.  “I know it’s a bit late but I wouldn’t want to get in the way of you and anyone else…”
    “Yeah, real late.  But don’t worry, I don’t have anyone.  I just live with my grandma and her Pets.”
    “P-pets!?” Xiao Yu exclaims.  “You have Pets?”
    “Well actually they belong to my grandmother.  Then again, she can’t take care of them anymore, much less herself, so I guess they are unofficially mine.”
    “That explains the dog smell” Xiao Yu says to herself.  She turns back to you, beginnings of an odd smile on her face.  “S-so you don’t mind owning pets?”
    “No, not really” you reply without any hesitation.  Yeah there’s a bit of a stigma about owning Uplifts as Pets.  Some people call you a slave driver, fascist, and beast fucker.  Well you suppose that last one’s true now, but eh.  You don’t really care.  Most people that actually know you don’t know or really care about you keeping Pets so it’s never bothered you.
    “Wow, most humans I run into treat my time as a Pet like some horrible thing” she shakes around “when it was probably some of the happiest years of my life.”
    “Well Anti-Pet sentiment got people riled up, so it’s no surprise” you look up at the kitchen clock.  “Ah shit, it’s that late already?  Sorry, I gotta run.  I’ll see you tomorrow Xiao Yu.”
    “Just call me Yu” Xiao Yu smiles as she gives you a kiss on the cheek.  Not a sort of lusty, bend-me-over-and-fuck-my-brains out kind of kiss but an I’ll-miss-you kiss.  Maybe this is more than just helping her with her ‘problem’?  Nah.
********************************************************************************************************************************
    As Anon leave, Xiao Yu is busily scribbling something on paper, barely able to contain her excitement.  She gives her note a once over before hugging it close.   “Ooh a couple more days of this, and I’m back on track!  Oh but what to call this?”
    She makes a hasty scribble, and shoves it into her drawer by her bed.  She jumps into bed, grabbing the pillow Anon had been laying on, laughing giddily, legs kicking in the air.  “Oooh Anon, I’ll make you mine yet!”
