>Be the son of human diplomat
>It's not bad, you're from the American Empire and that's a pretty decent country all things considered.
>Your dad just got assigned as the diplomat to the consulate for the A.E. in City Zero though, the anthro city-state built underneath Antarctica.
>The Genkits don't really have a lot of reason to love Americans, what with the whole.. trying to genocide them a century ago.
>It's not BAD per se, but a lot of Purists come from America, and it kind of paints everyone in a bad light.

>The apartment you get is in the residential district, one of several large underground districts the city is divided into.
>It's pretty nice. The district isn't hard to navigate, with lifts going to the various levels. Uppers are nicer apartments, bigger, more expensive. Lowers are cheaper housing.
>Though you have to admit, even the shitty parts of the city look pretty good.
>The apartments are no exception but you're getting restless, your family has been cooped up for three days getting unpacked and if you don't get out of here soon you're going to detonate, or something.
>So when your parents aren't looking you quietly disappear out of the apartment and hit the lifts, vanishing to another floor of the district, where you can get to the transportation system that runs throughout the city.
>FREEDOM
>When you arrived in the city you fell asleep on the way into the residential district, so you didn't really see a lot. That's changing now.
>The first thing you're discovering is that Genkits like nudity. Like, a lot.
>Not too surprising, even with everywhere in the city being climate controlled. They ARE anthros, after all.
>Genetically engineered and designed to be nice to look at but covered in fur nonetheless.
>Goddammit, PETA. You just HAD to start all this over animal rights, didn't you?

>Your thoughts nearly betray you as you run headfirst into a red panda who's running to the lift platform, both of you bowling over and eating shit next to the transport car doors.
>The first thing you're aware of is being on your back, and most of you hurting.
>The second thing is her tits in your face.
>"I'm so sorry!" She's standing up, pulling you to your feet. "I totally didn't see you there, are you okay?"
>You're okay, it's cool. No harm done. Plus, you know, titties. Does a boy some good.
>"Hah! Humans aren't usually that forward. I'm Rose, who're you?" She's talking and opening the car at the same time, climbing in.
>You take some time, explain your circumstances. Anon, delver of the anthro vaults and newly made immigrant to the city.
>"Wow, no kidding, you're living here? That's pretty unheard of." Gods, this girl is distracting. Naked as the day she was born, hourglass figure. You can tell she's at least a C cup, the flesh of her nipples a dark black.
>"Hellooo?" She's laughing, snapping her fingers in your face. "Hi, up here." Well, she doesn't SEEM to be mad, anyways. "Let me guess, not used to the nudity?"
>REALLY not used to the nudity, no.
>"That's adorable. It's okay, Genkit attitudes towards sex are pretty relaxed. I don't mind being looked at." She actually shimmies a little for you, jiggling her tits and grinning wryly. 
>Good gods, you could get used to this place.
>Just how old is Rose, anyways?
>"Oh, don't worry." She pffts. "Age of consent is a pretty complicated issue here. Generally if you're old enough to be interested in sex, you're old enough to hit the red light district and learn about it. I've been fucking since I was having my first period, it's no big deal. Never a human though. Is it different for you?"
>Well it's not like you're gonna know, you're a fuckin' virgin. You're still in highschool!
>Online courses, yeah, but... still.
>Uh oh. She's got a gleam in her eye. "Oh you are, are you?"

>You're not sure if you should answer that or not.
>"It's okay! I've heard humans make a pretty big deal out of sex." She shrugs, leaning back and grinning, letting her legs part a little.
>You can see her slit, framed in light red fur but it thins our around her lips, showing light black skin.
>Which is glistening.
>Oh fuck, she's wet.
>"You ever fooled around with anyone?" She keys the car, the controls beeping as it slows to a stop then thumps off the track halfway down the tunnel, parking temporarily.
>Uh, what?
>"No, seriously." She gestures at you. "Tell me. C'mon. I'm seriously thinking of fucking you here, now. You're cute and I've never had the chance with a human, AND you're a virgin. No way I'm letting you get away." She's laughing.
>Uh, what if I want to?
>"Well, I'm not gonna force you. But..." She parts her thighs, fingers sliding down as she spreads the lips of her pussy. She's so wet it's dribbling down her ass, her finger smearing it across her clit as she traces a light circle around it.
>"..If you want, I'll let you have your way any way you want. Your first girl will be an anthro and you'll never want human pussy again, trust me."
>Jesus, the smirk when she says it.
>She almost moans it, sliding her fingers into herself at the same time, gasping. 
>You can smell how wet she is, it's filling the tiny cabin and your cock is rock hard.
>Why is this even a debate?
>Oh, right. It's really not.
>You get up, pulling your shirt off and throwing it at her face, making her giggle as you kick off your pants.
>"Oh wow, it's so smooth! It's shaped differently, too." She's up immediately, moving between your knees as you sit back in the cars seat, moving your legs apart for her. "Wow."
>She's running her fingertips back and forth across your cock, her finger fingers smearing girlcum under the head as her other hand wraps around your shaft, stroking slowly.
>"Can I do buttstuff with you?"
>Can you what now?

>"Butt stuff. My fingers, my tongue." She's grinning, leaning in and sliding her tongue from the base of your cock to the head, then wrapping her lips around it and working her tongue in circles inside her mouth against the glans under the head of your cock.
>You're REALLY beginning to like this goddamned city.
>Frankly, you don't give a shit what she does as long as it feels as good as this. 
>"Oooh! Good." She almost purrs the word, moving your legs apart and stroking your cock overhand before her tongue presses against your asshole and for a few seconds, time stops.
>You've never felt anything like it.
>Your cock throbs hard in her hand, her tongue moving away as she squeezes your cock lightly, stroking upward while her tongue works its way to your balls
>Oh gods, she's sucking on them, you can feel her tongue darting against them while she strokes you off.
>Your cock is throbbing pretty hard in her hand when she stops and you're left panting, looking at her like 'why'd you stop?'.
>She smirks and answers you by taking your whole cock down her throat.
>At once.
>In a single smooth motion.
>She holds herself at the base and looks up at you, working her tongue back and forth as she slowly draws her lips back.
>Your cock pulses one more time, and then that's it
>You blow your load in her mouth, your cock pulsing as hot, thick cum paints her tongue.
>You can see her eyes roll up a little as she laps at your cock, coaxing your jizz out of you, stroking you off into her mouth
>She never spills a drop
>When your cock slides out of her mouth, she sticks her jizz-smeared tongue out at you to show you the huge load you just nutted in her mouth, then makes a show of swallowing it down and licking her lips.
>"Human cum tastes REALLY good. Where are you staying again?"

>Two weeks later
>You've settled in nicely. You have had absolutely no complaints since your official welcome to the city by Rose.
>Shame you never saw her again after that.
>Gods, that tongue.
>Your day has mostly consisted of doing school work and working at a small electronics ship over in the market district, a job which basically involves you pretending you're Han Solo all day.
>You don't know what half of this shit even is but your manager does and that's all that matters.
>The fact he doesn't give a shit if you smoke pot ion the job helps too
>Mostly because he's a fucking chimney himself
>You never knew rhino anthros had a thing for smoking, but you're learning new things every day at this point
>The casual nudity has grown on you. You've even partaken a couple times yourself when you were confident no one you would know was around.
>Mostly you've gotten curious looks, compliments and questions about the lack of scars.
>No idea what that last one is about, but whatever.

>You're sitting in the food court one day just after work, pecking at some nacho fries and thinking about what you'll do when you get home.
>It's not that you don't like your family, you do. They're your family. Just, you're tired of sharing a room with your step sister and not having your own space and literally EVERYTHING in this city is about personal space and lack of boundaries.
>It's a constant reminder of the things you don't have.
>Consequently, you've learned to meander and take your time and generally fuck around on your way home from work. 
>Hence, the food court.

>Nacho fries aren't half bad, actually.
>You've been meandering around the entertainment district, a huge vertical shaft nearly a mile deep with platforms hung at various levels above and below bridges going back and forth between the walls. 
>It's very Star Wars
>It's also very easy to get lost in.
>That happened two days ago and it took awhile to get home, unfortunately.
>It's while you're pondering on that when the mouse sits down in front of you.
>"Hi! Sorry, all the tables are taken." She looks apologetic. At least she has clothes on, though. You can tell she isn't wearing a bra.
>Goddammit brain, you're distracting.
>Brain: I regret nothing.
>You tell her it's fine, you were lost in thought anyways. She's no bother. 
>"Thanks, you're sweet. Not a lot of humans hang out here. What brings you to Zero?" 
>She's eating what looks like...
>Wait a minute, this fucking girl got nacho fries.
>Great minds think alike.
>"Hah, yeah. I dunno, just had a craving for them. Funny that you got them too. Hey, don't think I didn't notice you dodging my question." She's wiggling her fork at you, smiling. 
>Ah, you moved to the city. Your dads in politics but you try to stay out of all of that, so mostly it just leaves you in an unfamiliar place with a completely different culture.
>"Ooh, that must be rough. Culture shock, huh?" She's eating, nodding thoughtfully. It's making her ears bob while her head moves.
>Why do they all have to have adorable mannerisms and body language?
>Oh, right. Genetically engineered to be cute.
>It's not so bad though, really. The people are, ah, friendly and the entire city is pretty sci-fi.
>"Oh, I know what you mean. Everyone is super touchy-feely. I love the holo-walls too. You know I didn't grow up here?"
>Really?
>"Really. I'm from Canada. I only moved here two years ago, for work."
>That's pretty cool. You've been to Canada, everyone was really polite.
>"Why thank you~"

>So she's not the touchy-feely type then?
>"Well, I mean... all of us Genkits are, a little. We like physical contact. The way humans do, but it's kind of amped up. We'd probably drive each other crazy if not for the social bonding we have."
>Huh?
>"Okay, so... humans form social bonds through school, work, that kinda thing right?"
>Right, yeah. You've made friends that way, sure.
>"But humans also got there through evolution, and that's messy. We didn't. Six, seven generations ago we were made to be... I dunno, race-loyal, I guess? The idea of attacking another Genkit, it's just not something that occurs to us. Exploitation of each other that way. For humans, that was a necessary, even a beneficial evolutionary trait. For us, it was a drawback, so it was removed."
>You just kind of stare at her across from your empty plate and blink.
>What.
>"What?"
>She sounds like a science lecturer or something.
>"Pfft, no. Just good education. Hey, I never caught your name, what is it?"
>You're Anon. Nonny to your friends.
>"Cool. Nice to meet you, I'm Mimi."
>That smile.
>That damned smile.

>Your phone begins beeping at you.
>Oh damnit. If you don't get moving you won't be home in time to help your mom set up that stupid bookshelf like you promised.
>Uuuuggghhh.
>"No, it's cool. I get it." She's smiling at you. "Taking care of your priorities shows a good head on your shoulders, you should do that. Maybe I'll see you around, yeah? I usually get off work right about now."
>Oh shit, you got off work only 20 minutes ago.
>You really might run into her again.
>Not that you have time to contemplate it. With some goodbyes, you wave to her and take off towards the lifts to the level with the transport cars so you can get to the residential district.
>You're probably gonna be late.
>Oh well, mom can deal.

>You were late.
>Mom is not dealing.
>She's pretty mad at your ass actually, mostly because of the breaking of the commitment without sending any word. You didn't call ahead.
>Okay, fair enough. The circumstances around your tardiness come to light.
>She's a little wary about that.
>"Anon, you have to be careful, you know. These anthro girls, they're not like us. They don't get attached. You get all lovey-dovey about one and you'll get your heart broken a week later. It's just for a year, dear. Then we'll head back to America and you can find a real girl to date."
>A real girl
>That kind of casual bigotry is part of why you're at odd with them a lot.
>You don't like hearing it from her, but it'll cause a fight if you say anything, so you let it go for now.
>Get the bookshelf done so you can fuck off and go smoke some of what Sam, your boss, gave you.
>You'd swear he's a rastafari or something but you've never heard of a rasta rhino.
>Yet.

>The next day
>You're just finishing work, you've just punched out, Sam's thanked you with a pat on the back and a couple of grams of the good stuff
>You're beginning to think he has a grow operation someplace but since it's legal in Zero, you can't really complain about the free smoke
>Not that you would
>Sam is a fuckin' solid guy. You've seen him cut deals for people who could almost afford things, work out payment plans for people who needed things, take losses on a buy because someone needed the money desperately.
>Sam has a heart, you'll give him that much.
>You're just arriving at the food cart you usually go to, you have NO idea what this guys name is but holy shit he makes the best nachos, burritos, tacos and shawarma you have ever had in your entire life.
>The guys a gecko, you think. Maybe a chameleon. You don't know lizards too well.
>Actually, come to think of it, it could be several lizard-guys all related to each other and you would have no idea.
>Shit. Genkits all kind of look the same to you.
>Is that racist?
>Time has run out to contemplate this riveting train of thought because your turn has come up. 
>Bomb burrito for days, baby.
>Biggest goddamned thing you've ever seen. You were amazed it didn't fall apart the first time you saw it.
>Proper American food, in other words.

>You're standing there waiting for your grub when you feel a tap on your shoulder.
>You turn to look but no one is there, so you look the other side, and then down.
>Oh, it's the mouse from the other day. 
>"Hi again!" She's only about as tall as your chest. You didn't notice she was a shortstack yesterday. "Told you I'd see you again. Whatcha getting?"
>The Bomb.
>"Oh, gods. Really? Do you think you can eat it all?"
>Proooobably not, but you need to make this sacrifice and make the attempt anyways.
>For science.

>That makes her giggle. "Okay, well, tell you what. I'll get something small, and if you can't finish it, I will. I don't think you'll get even halfway though, and if you do, I'll totally pay for it."
>What, get a free lunch? Why aren't you worried about human cooties or something?
>She just rolls her eyes at you. "Nonny, we can't get 90% of the diseases you get. You won't make me sick." She hugs your arm, leaning into you casually.
>She's even wagging her tail.
>Holy shit, she's wagging her tail.
>Your brain is about to explode from the cute, fuck.
>Your food comes up and she oohs, mostly because hers does at the same time. The gecko-meleons are nice enough to put it all one one large tray and she grabs it before you can stop her.
>Guess you're eating together, but it's fine.
>Getting hugged felt kind of nice, like having a really soft blanket thrown on you.
>And she IS pretty cute in a mousey sort of way.
>"Hey, ground control to Anon. You alive?"
>Huh?
>She's sitting down with the tray. "You gonna sit down, dude? You're just kind of staring off into space."
>Oh, right, you should probably do that.
>"What's on your mind? You kinda did that yesterday too."
>You're busy unwrapping the Bomb.
>She wasn't joking. The fucking burrito is the size of a small loaf of french bread.
>HOW THE HELL DID THEY EVEN DO THAT?
>To answer her though, you know... not much. Life in the city, mulling over the coincidence of meeting her again, contemplating your life choices now that you've seen what you've managed to sign yourself up for.
>May the gods watch over your anus.
>"Haaaaah. Okay, well, I'll admit it. I was kind of looking for you."
>Aaaaaa?
>"Oh don't gimme that look. Also, swallow before you do that." She's laughing as she says it though. "Okay, look. Remember when I said I grew up in Canada? I grew up mostly around humans." She gestures around at the food stands, the holo walls with their colorful ads and moving videos and faux environmental conditions.

>"Look, this city... I lived outdoors my whole life, and everything is enclosed here. The holo walls do a good job of pretending to be windows, and they even make the air smell like places but... it's not the same, you know? There's no humans. I'm used to human society, where I'm super touchy and it bothers people. Here, people constantly invade my personal space more than even I'm used to." She levels a finger at me. "But not you."
>Aaaaaaaaaa?
>"You talk to my face, not my tits. And when I hugged your arm a few minutes ago you were cool about it. So yeah." She looks a little embarrassed. "You remind me of home, and you have no friends here, and I have only a few friends here, so... lets be friends."
>You can't really argue the logic.
>You wonder aloud if she always finishes work the same time.
>"Yep, every day. Why, when do you finish?"
>You tell her, and let her know where Sams is.
>"Oh hey, I know that place! They got some prime shit in there sometimes. I've found a lot of my retro video games in there."
>Oh shit
>You didn't think your metaphorical erection could get any harder
>Or the literal one
>You were wrong
>"Do you smoke weed?"
>So, so wrong.

>About an hour later you're both in one of the seasonal parks,massive rooms meant to simulate outdoor conditions in different seasons. Summer, winter, spring, fall.
>You came to the autumn one with her, all the leaves golden colored on birch trees, the park grass let grown to knee-height with logs instead of benches and small hidden niches where one can have a small bonfire, provided you have wood for it anyways.
>You're at one of these niches - minus the fire - with Mimi, both of you sitting on the ground, smoking a large blunt between you. 
>"Man, that sucks." She's speaking quietly, puffing and handing it to you after. "Controlling parents, mildly creepy stepsister and you get moved around constantly to boot? No wonder you're wound up so tight."
>Huh?
>"Dude I can literally smell how stressed out you are."
>Oh.

>"It's alright. We have sensitive noses, I can't really blame you for that." She grins "Easier to ignore when I'm smoking some prime bud. Where'd you get this?"
>From your boss.
>"Your boss is the Rasta Rhino? Seriously?"
>Fucking seriously?
>That's actually what people call him?
>HAHAHAHHAAHAHAHAHAHAA

>Okay, you've recovered. You think.
>The laughing got pretty intense there for a few minutes.
>She joined in halfway through you trying to explain what was so funny, giggling the entire time.
>Both of you are leaning on each other, laughing and passing the blunt between you.
>"Oh man. Anon, how old are you, seriously?"
>Aw. You're eighteen, but-
>"No, no. Eighteen is good. Nice and legal. I'm twenty but I have a hard time telling ages with humans, you all kind of look same-ish sometimes."
>Okay, you're feeling a little less bad about that now.
>It's a good thing you're about the same age though, because you can't really tell with genkits either. Fuckers grow up quick.
>"This is the most fun I've had in like, months. I mean, I know we didn't do anything, but still..." She shrugs, grinning at you and passing the joint. "I've had a blast. Aren't your parents gonna wonder where you went?" 
>Fuck no, you told them you're staying at Sam's for a morning job.
>"Excellent! I get you to myself all night."
>You give her a look that makes her realize what she just said, laughing and...
>Oh my god you didn't know anthros could blush.
>Turns out the fur on her face is very fine, and she totally can, and it's goddamned adorable.
>"Sorry. I wasn't thinking about what I was saying, I don't mean... you know." She rubs the back of her neck. "Just, if you wanna hang out, I'd love to. Hang out. Platonically."
>Her awkwardness is just ramping the cuteness up.
>LaForge to bridge, I think we're in trouble, Captain.
>That sounds great though. You haven't had the chance to see much of the city.
>She lights up when she hears that. "Oooh, I am totally gonna show you around!"
