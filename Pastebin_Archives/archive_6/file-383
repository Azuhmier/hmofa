>Part 1

>Be Anon, 21 years-old and living alone
>Sitting at my pc, looking at some model-kits to buy
>Just browsing the list and then get a bit of craving for food
>Go to fridge and get grapes to eat
>Close fridge and return to pc
>Got a message on Steam
>’hmm?’
>It’s from Laila, who I met once playing Payday 2 and ended up being good friends with
>Message reads: “Hey Anon, can you come on Discord?”
>type: ”k”
>Open up Discord and go to our personal chat-room
>”Yo” I say into my mic
>Silence at first, then the sound of something being placed
>”Sorry, had to check my phone.” Her kind voice is one of the things I like about her
>”Don’t mind don’t mind, so why’d you call up on discord?” I ask before throwing a grape in my mouth
>”I just wanted to ask you, do you…want to meet up?”
>”Uh...Where’s this coming from?”
>”Well I thought since that we’ve been online friends for about 4 years now, we could at least meet up sometime.” Her mic picks up a subtle hint of shyness in her voice
>”Ok,  but like...Where and when?”
>”At a park or something, maybe next week or maybe even today…" The last part of her sentence gets me interested
>I pop another grape in my mouth
>”Hold up, I’m gonna check something.”
>Open up my phone
>”You still live in the same city that you told me last time?
>“Yeah.”
>Quickly fill the info on Maps
>”An hour and 52 minutes drive from where I live.”
>”Wait, are you seriously considering driving here, NOW?”
>”Why not? You just said you wanted to meet up.”
>”Yes but-”
>”Too late for backsies now.” I say as I exit the chat and turn off my pc and put the rest of the grapes back in the fridge
>Put on suitable outdoor wear A.K.A slacks, jacket and a cap
>”Ready or not, here I come.”
>Exit the house and get in my third-gen Ford Mondeo, which is stationed in the garage
>Open the garage door with a remote
>Drive car out
>Close the garage door
>Get phone out and text her: “In my car, where should we meet up?”
>See that she starts writing back immediately
>”If you’re seriously doing this, then maybe at my place? I’ll send you the address.”
>I message her back: ”Cool, see ya there.”
>She then sends her address and I route out a path there
>Open my music library on my phone and play some music
>Start driving
>...
>I’m currently a few minutes away from her house
>City has nice scenery and is generally what I’d expect from a seaside city
>Turn off music and start looking around as I turn a corner
>”That’s...it, I think?” I look to my left at a one-story house with light-blue paint on the outside
>Awkwardly park on the side of the driveway and walk to the house
>”Alright, now let’s see…” I mumble as I ring the doorbell
>Few seconds pass before the door opens
>’A kid?’
>The little fawn-furred Spitz, guessing six years old, stares at me with curiously
>”Who are you?”
>”I’m a friend of Laila’s. Is she here?” I crouch to eye-level with the kid
>Just then, a beautiful Finnish Lapphund, wearing an apron over a t-shirt and jeans, comes over
>”Hey, Franz-dear, don’t run off like tha-” She pats the kid and freezes when she sees me
>”Hello. Uh...Is Laila home?” I ask the female dog, noting her fluffy, brown and white fur and small white markings above her eyes which makes it look like she has cute little eyebrows
>”A-Anon? You really came?”
>”Wait...You’re Laila?”
>She nods, albeit shyly
>”Huh. And by the way, you didn’t tell me you had a kid.” I point at said child
>”Oh, he’s not my child. He’s our neighbour's. I’m just taking care of him because his parents are on a business trip. And his parents left him with me about an hour after you started coming here.”
>”Hmm. Can I come in?”
>”Yeah of course! I’m making dinner and you can have some since you’re probably hungry.” Her tail trails behind her as she and the kid go further into the house
>”You read my mind.” I snap my fingers and enter after them
>I walk into a living room and see Laila’s tail go into another room
>Peek into the room she entered and see a fairly quaint kitchen with all necessary things a kitchen needs
>Laila is baking something, can’t really see what though
>Feel a tug on my sleeve and turn my head and I see Franz, staring at me with fair eyes
>”Umm, can you come play a game with me?”
>I smile and nod at him and his curious expression brightens as he proceeds to pull on my sleeve more and he leads me to the living room couch
>”LBP, huh?” I look at the TV mounted on the wall, glancing at the PS4 sitting on the shelf below and then turn to look at the excited boy
>”Here.” He hands me a controller
>”Thanks.” I take the controller and sit down on the couch and Franz sits down next to me
>’How is it possible for a single kid to be so happy?’
>...
>We play for about 45 minutes, with us making a few jokes and generally having a good time
>”Hey, I’ve got dinner ready!” Laila yells from the kitchen
>”Welp, let’s go eat then.” I get up, turn off the console and then follow the sweet smell emanating from the kitchen
>”Okay!” Franz is walking behind me, corked tail wagging behind and pointy ears happily perked up
>We enter the kitchen and see Laila is setting up the table
>”I made apple pie!” She puffs proudly
>”What are you, my grandmother?” I snort jokingly and I hear Franz tries to hold his laughter
>”I’ll take that as a compliment.” She takes off the apron, revealing her grey t-shirt and jeans and I momentarily lose myself staring at her
>”Why are you staring at her?”
>’Franz, please.’
>Laila snaps her face towards me with a perplexed face
>’Please don’t take it wrongly, please don’t take it wrongly, please don’t take it wrongly-’
>”Thank you.” She fiddles with the apron in her paws before placing it to hang
>’Crisis averted?’
>”Now then, let’s eat!” She turns and sit down at the table
>I sit opposite of her and Franz sits next to me
>The table has three plates and eating instruments paired with them, the apple pie itself on a stand and a jug of milk next to it
>”I’ll cut it.” Laila takes a knife lying near the pie and slices the pie neatly into slices
>I hold out my plate and she slowly sets a slice on it, the smell of the pie wafting up pleasently
>”Thanks.” I say as she hands Franz a slice as well and then takes one for herself
>We then start to eat
>Eat a piece of the slice
>”It’s really good.” I and Franz say at the same time
>”Glad you like it!” Laila says as she eats a piece
>’Heh, It’s like we’re a family or something.’
>After eating and drinking, we place the stand, jug, plates and utensils in the sink
>”I’ll wash them later, so don’t worry.” She waves her paw and we go to the living room
>I sit down at couch’s left side and Franz sits to my right
>”You’re really attached to Anon, aren’t you?” Laila sits down next to the boy and pats him on the head
>”Umm...Can I call you big bro?” He timidly asks
>’That’s cute’
>”Yeah, of course.”
>”Thanks big bro!” He gives a radiant smile
>’I want to protect that smile’
>”And you can call me big sis, if you want to.” Laila pats his head some more
>”Okay big sis!” he happily responds and I think she reached the same conclusion as me
>’This feels nice… I think I’ll stay over tonight’
>”Anon, should you be going home or something? Don’t you have work tomorrow?” She asks while continuing to pat Franz
>”I’m on vacation.”
>”Oh. Wait, does that mean you’re staying over?”
>”Yeah.” I say and notice the kid’s tail wagging faster
>He pulls me and Laila closer to him by our arms
>”Can we watch a movie?” He excitedly asks
>”Alright, but we’re going to bed right after, okay?” She says as she gets up and goes to select a movie from a shelf filled with dvds and blurays
>”How about this, ”Eureka Seven: Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers”. It’s a pretty good movie.” The way she says the title was….let’s just say, cute
>”Let’s watch it!” The voice of the excited boy resounds
>Laila sets up the PS4 ready to play the movie
>Movie starts
>...
>Movie ends
>”That was a good movie.” I yawn before standing up
>”Yeah!” Franz is still happy as before
>”Mmm… Now then, let’s go brush our teeth and then go to bed.” Laila stretches a little as she stands up
>”And the bathroom’s opposite of the kitchen.” She adds before going there herself
>Franz and I proceed after her into the clean bathroom with a toiled, sink with a mirror-equipped drawer above it and a shower and bath-tub in the back
>”You two can use these.” She hands us toothbrushes that look recently-bought
>We all then wash our teeth and prepare to go bed
>”I’ll be sleeping on the couch, but what about the kid?” I exit the bathroom and go back to the living room
>”He’ll be sleeping with me.” She says as she starts to go to, what I presume is, her room
>”Oh, okay.” I watch her walk past the living room and to the other hallways containing two doors to the right and two to left as well
>”Good night, big bro!” Franz jumps to hug me and I catch him with a hug of my own
>”Same to you, little bro.” I place him down on the floor and he runs off, following Laila
>I take off my jacket and then lay myself on the couch
>’Now, time to go to sleep.’ I close my eyes and soon after, drift asleep
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 2

>”..on. Anon, wake up!”
>Open my eyes
>Blue eyes stare back
>”Anon, you alright? You looked like you were having a nightmare.”
>’Huh…’
>”Don’t worry about it.” I slowly raise myself from the couch, noticing I had a blanket covering me
>”I just thought you would be cold without any covering, so I got that for you.” She smiles and stands up
>”Thanks.” I take the blanket off
>”Franz is still asleep, want some coffee?” She asks as she takes the blanket and folds it
>”Okay.” I sleepily yawn as she place the folded blanket down, then walks away and turn left
>I walk once again enter the kitchen
>”How do you want it?”
>”Same as yours.”
>”Alright.”
>I then sit down at the table, yawning again
>”So, when are you leaving?” She asks while preparing the coffee machine
>”How long is Franz staying?”
>”A week, wait… You aren’t intending on staying over here for a week, are you?”
>”Yep. He probably wants me stay here as well.”
>”Well, that’s true.”
>We both laugh and then stay in silence, but not the awkward kind
>”Here.” She hands me a cup of coffee with a bit of milk poured in
>”Thanks.” I grab the cup by the handle and blow on the coffee a little, then I take a sip
>”Good?” She asks before sitting down herself
>”Yeah.”
>We drink our coffee in silence, the sun’s rays dimly lighting the room
>I place my cup on the table and Laila’s paw then takes it away
>”I’m gonna wash these.”
>”I’ll help.” I stand up and walk with her to the sink
>”Oh, thanks.” We start cleaning the dishes from yesterday and the cups we used just now
>It takes only a couple minutes before we’re finished
>”That’s that, I guess.”
>”Thanks for helping.”
>”No problem.” I once again find myself staring at her
>”You’re so different from when we’re talking online.” I spout out
>”Well, you’re bit a different as well.” She spins on her heel and throws another smile to me
>”Let’s go see if Franz is up.” She walks out of the kitchen, with me right behind her
>”...By the way, I just noticed. You’re wearing pajamas.” I say the obvious
>She almost jumps when I say that
>”W-Well, yeah. Something wrong with it?”
>”Nah, I think it looks cute on you.”
>”Ah, thanks.” I think she’s blushing, but I can’t really see under that fur as it's puffed
>We then continued to her bedroom
>”Franz, are you awake?” She whispers as she peeks in the room
>A small yawn comes from the bed
>”Big sis, where’d you go?”
>”I’m right here” Laila’s motherly voice responds
>Franz , also wearing pajamas, then comes over and hugs Laila and gives a sleepy smile
>We three proceeded to brush our teeth and then go to the kitchen
>”What do you two want for breakfast?” Laila asks as she goes over to the fridge
>”Something with fruit.” I sit down and look to Franz sitting down next to me
>He yawns and I pat him
>”Sleep well?”
>”Mmm!” His tail starts wagging
>”How about cereal with yogurt and fruit?” Laila suggests while checking the fridge
>”That’s fine with me, what about you Franz?”
>”Fine with me too!”
>Laila then takes the yogurt and fruit from the fridge and the cereal from a cupboard next to the fridge
>She quickly make three bowls of cereal and places them on the table alongside a spoon to go with each bowl
>”Let’s dig in!” She sits down and starts eating
>She finishes quite quickly and sets the bowl in the sink
>”I’m gonna go to work now.” She says as she walk out and presumably changes out of her pajamas in her room
>...
>”Bye!” She hollers from the front of the house probably
>”See ya.” I yell back as I finish eating my bowl
>”Bye bye!” Franz also seems to have finished eating
>Hear the front door close as we set down our bowls and then exit the kitchen
>”So, what do you wanna do?” I ask Franz after flopping myself on the couch
>”Can we go to the park? It’s really nice!” I wasn’t expecting him to say that, but that sounds interesting.
>”Well, ok.”
>I got my jacket and put it on
>Franz goes into Laila's room and changes into a t-shirt and shorts
>”How close is the park?” I ask as I grab the knob of the front door
>”Not very far, I’ll lead you there!” He runs out as I open the door
>”Okay then.”
>...
>’I saw this park when I came here. Wonder if it’s the one Laila wanted to meet up in?’
>We enter the enclosed wooded park from the front gate
>Not many people there, just a few here and there
>”Come on! I’ll show a really nice spot here!” Franz pulls on my arm and I try to maintain my balance while following him
>As I look around while Franz is effectively dragging me, I noticed a few people give glances and some even stared at us
>’They probably think I’m this kid’s dad or something.’ I chuckle
>After a few more seconds, we hear a giant tree near a lake that’s in the middle of the park
>”This is my favourite spot! What do you think?” Franz sits down and motions for me to do the same
>I sit down and look around: ”It’s a pretty spot.” Just then, a small breeze blows through
>’Aaaah, that’s the stuff’ I close my eyes and listen, to the breeze, to the leaves on the trees dancing to the tune of the wing
>I lay down on my back and open my eyes
>’...Wait, why’s there someone sitting in the tree?’
>They turn their eyes to me
>”Oh hi.” the male voice comes from the figure and they jump down from the tree
>Lands next to me
>”New here? Don’t see many people visiting here.” The male wolfhound stands tall, blocking the sun from my eyes
>”I’m just staying over at a friend’s for a week. Helping them take of this kid.” I pat Franz as to pronounce my point
>”That’s interesting. By the way, I’m Jyrki.” He leans over to probably shake hands/paws
>”I’m Anon, nice to meet you Jyrki.” I shake his paw and i’m a bit surprised by his strong grip 
>”And this little guy is Franz.” His eyes turn to the kid
>”Hello!” Franz waves to the wolfhound and he waves back
>He checks his wristwatch
>”Oh, I’ve gotta go. Nice meeting ya!” Jyrki then starts running to the park gates
>”Huh, that was an interesting encounter.”
>Franz and I then continue to sit/lay in the park for awhile
>”Wanna go walk around the city? Since I’m wondering what this place is like.” I turn to Franz
>”Hmm? Uh, okay! I’ll show you around!” He gleefully jumps up and I raise myself from the ground and then pat my back a little
>”Go ahead. I hope you show me the best sights.”
>...
>We walked around the city, seeing sights and shops
>I bought us some take-away burritos for lunch from a small restaurant
>Then after that, we went back to Laila’s place as we ate
>Get to the house while holding Franz’s paw
>Lights seem to be on
>’Huh, she’s probably home.’
>Try opening the door, but it’s locked
>Ring the doorbell then
>Door opens
>Now it’s a cat behind the door
>”Laila? Why is there a cute human with a kid at your door?” The cat is about a head shorter than me, and I’m of average height
>She looks like a cat with grey, frizzy fur wearing a green hoodi and some shorts and she's bare-feet
>”I told you about him didn’t I? He’s Anon.” Laila says from the left hallway
>”Oh, so he’s the guy. Well, nice meeting you!” She raises her paw to fistbump
>bump
>”Nice meeting you as well.” I give her a small grin
>”You’re pretty hot.” She immediately responds
>”Thanks?"
>”No problem~” She purrs before crouching and patting Franz
>”Hi there, little boy.”
>”Hi!” Franz goes to shake paws with her
>”You’re... so adorable!” She lifts the boy off the ground and hugs him tightly 
>She then puts him down on the ground and retreats into the house
>I go in with Franz sneaking behind my legs
>”We got cute boys in the house, how could this day get better!?” She hops down on the couch and lays down
>”Could you make some space?” I ask as I reach the couch
>”Ah, sorry.” She moves her legs out of the way and I sit down
>She then places her legs on my lap
>’What.’
>”Uh…” Is all I can say as I slowly roll my eyes over her legs, to her face
>”You don’t mind, right?” She sticks her tongue out 
>”Faye, don’t harass Anon.” Laila says as she lightly bonks the cat on the head
>”It’s called teasing and I’m allowed to do it!” She childishly pouts
>I let out a small chuckle
>”Look, Anon gets it!” She sits up and throws her left arm behind my head and pulls me closer by my shoulder
>’God, she is VERY touchy feely.’
>”Hey Anon…” She inches even closer, so much so that I can smell her light coat of perfume
>”...wanna come over to my place for a ride?” She whispers in my ear
>’What.’
>”Uh..um...I…” I stutter out as I try to free myself from her one-arm hug
>”I’m just screwing with you!” She pulls away and gives a cheeky smile before I let out a nervous laugh
>”...This is why you can’t get a boyfriend, Faye.” Laila sits down next to her, and I take note of the dog’s beige top and denim shorts
>”Like you’re any better.”
>”Shush you.”
>”So, you confess your undying love yet?” Faye blatantly asks as I feel this weird sensation of something not being correct filling me
>”...” Laila, clearly flustered, turns her head away
>”What? You still haven’t confessed?” Faye sigh
>The cat then places a paw on my shoulder
>”Alright dude, listen. She’s is madly in love with you and is too shy to confess it. And also-”
>I see Laila getting up and she almost runs into her room
>”Hey Laila…” I try to say after her, but she slams the door behind her
>I get up and go after her, ignoring the surreal feeling I'm getting right now
>Open the door and enter the room
>No lights on, but I can still see the outline of a desk, a shelf above it and a bed to my left
>There’s a someone, with bed sheets covering their body, lying on the bed and they're not making a sound
>”Laila?”
>No response
>Get on the bed on my knees and move in closer
>place my hand on the sheet and feel something under it flinch
>”A..Anon?” Says the muffled voice
>”Yeah, you okay Laila?”
>Her head slowly comes out from beneath the sheets
>”Sorry…”
>”What’s there to apologize for?”
>”For my friend being a stupid blabbermouth…” She gets out from under the sheets
>”Hey, don’t worry about it.”
>”So Anon, do you...” She sits up and hugs her legs “...even like me?” She turns her face away from me
>”What are you talking about? If I didn’t, I wouldn’t have come here.”
>”Huh?” She turns back to me and her eyes seem light-up a little
>I unfold my legs and come closer to her
>”What I mean, is that...of course I like you.”
>Then I kiss her on the lips
>Slowly back away and go back to sitting with my legs loosely crossed
>We end up just sitting there for a couple seconds in awkward silence, with me just staring downwards
>”So, uh..." 
>I try to shift my gaze up and then suddenly feel her paw on my leg
>”C-Can you stay here with me for a little while?” Laila asks she comes closer to me
>”...Yeah.” I say and she comes closer and sits down between my legs while facing me
>”You’re so warm, Anon.” She hugs me and moves her head so that I feel her fur caress my neck and under my chin
>”You’re pretty warm too.” As I say that, I envelop her in a hug of my own
>After probably a minute of us just being there, the door creaks slowly open
>”Awww~ You two look so cute together.” Faye is at the door, with Franz peeking in as well
>”Thanks Faye.” Laila smiles and pulls herself a bit more closer to me
>”No problem, gonna go now. And remember: "Good night, sleep tight, young lovers".” Faye throws up a thumbs up before leaving
>Franz then walks in the room
>”Big sis, are you okay?” His nervous eyes turned from the floor to Laila
>”I’m fine, I just got a little upset and your big bro here cheered me up.” She lightly rubs her head against my chin
>”T-That tickles.” I snicker a little before I let go of her and she gets off the bed
>”Now then, let’s go have dinner!” She joyously skips out of the room, with Franz trailing her
>”Alright then.” I get up and leave the room
>”Oh, and Anon?” Laila turns to me right before the kitchen, the background wavering
>”Yeah?”
>”You’re sleeping in my bed with us tonight.” She then gives me a small peck on the cheek
>”I’d be happy to.” I return the kiss and we then enter the kitchen in this unreal moment
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 3

>’...Was that a dream?’
>I open my eyes to the living room ceiling
>Roll off the blanket and stand myself up
>Stretch a little and go to the bathroom
>’There’s someone in the kitchen?’ I reach the bathroom door before noting the smell of coffee
>Peek into the kitchen and see Laila making coffee, a small sadness in me that the dream wasn't true
>”Morning.” I enter the kitchen and sit down at the same chair as always
>”Oh, good morning. I hope Faye wasn’t too much of a nuisance yesterday.” Laila sets down a cup filled with black coffee
>”No she wasn’t. She was a bit weird but seems nice in general.” I take the cup and take a small sip
>”Big sis, can I have some of that too?” Franz sleepily comes in the kitchen doorway
>”It’s probably a bit too strong for you.” I retort and the boy then goes to the bathroom
>”Be sure to brush your teeth.” Laila reminds him and he gives a thumbs-up before going in the bathroom
>A few minutes pass and Franz comes out from the bathroom and I go in next
>”I’m gonna leave breakfast for you two here, so remember to eat.”
>”Where you going Laila?” I ask just as I enter the bathroom
>”Gotta go to work, obviously.” she says and changes clothes pretty quickly and exits the house with a quick wave
>The door closes and I go do my duties in the bathroom
>Rest of the morning goes by quickly
>Me and Franz play some video games for a couple hours before we decide to go shopping
>We go a small convenience store and buy some lunch
>’There’s probably enough stuff back at the house for Laila to make dinner with.’
>Pay for food and go to park again and to the same spot as yesterday and I look up into the tree
>”That your favourite spot or something?” I ask the figure sitting in the tree
>”Yeah. I always climbed and sat here when I was younger.” Jyrki jumps down
>”Heh, I used to also sit in trees as kid, mostly because I didn’t want my parents finding me when I stole some cookies from the jar.” I laugh at the childhood memory of me sitting in a tree that was in the backyard of the old house
>”My parents never found out.” I whisper to the wolfhound
>”And kid, you probably shouldn’t do the same. It’s bad to steal.” I pat Franz on the head
>”Can I eat my lunch?” Franz asks and his stomach then sounds in response
>”Yeah, let’s do that. You want some Jyrki? I got extra.” I hand him a wrapped sandwich
>”Ah, thanks.” He politely takes the sandwich and unwraps it
>”Hope you don’t mind it not being as hot as when I bought it.” I take a bite out of my sandwich and sit down on the grass
>Franz and Jyrki sit down as well and we eat our sandwiches while chatting about recent things
>”Huh, didn’t know there’s a convention happening this week. Sounds interesting.” I finish my sandwich and throw the wrap into a garbage bin nearby
>”Yes!” I whisper between my teeth while doing a fistpump
>”Nice throw. And yeah, it’s gonna be pretty cool. Wanna come this weekend?” Jyrki stands up places his wrap normally in the bin and Franz places his after
>”Well, I guess I could. Can Franz come too?”
>”There’s no age-limit, just a entry fee.” The wolfhound sits back down 
>”Huh. You interested Franz?”
>”Yeah! I’ve never been to a convention! I wanna go!” He’s back in happy mode
>”Well then. Now we’ll just need to see if Laila’s coming along as well.” I pat the excited kid
>”Laila? You know her too?” Jyrki asks
>”Yeah, I’m currently staying over at her place.”
>”Seriously?”
>Nod my head
>”Oh, how’d you end up staying there?”
>”I at first just went to visit her, but ended up helping her take care of the kid over there.” I pointed to said kid who was staring at the clouds while laying down
>”Hmm...I’m gonna go now, gotta run a couple errands. See ya.” Jyrki runs off
>”See ya around.”
>”Bye!” Franz turns on his stomach and then lifts himself up
>We stay in the park for a while before going back to the house
>I decide to take a nap on the couch while Franz decides to play some video games
>”Wake me up if someone knocks on the door, ok?” I throw off my jacket and get myself comfortable on the couch
>”Ok!”
>Close my eyes and soon fall asleep
>...
>...
>Slowly open my eyes and notice the lighting is significantly darker
>’It’s night already?’
>There’s a blanket covering me and...The door opens?
>Raise myself to see a familiar tail exit through the door
>’Laila?’ I get up and put my jacket on
>’What could she be up at night?’
>I follow her out of the house
>”The park? Why?”
>I enter the street-light lit park after her, trailing a good distance from her
>She stops at a bench and I move behind a tree which seems to be close enough to see and hear her
>’What’s she up to?’
>Someone comes from the shadows
>’Hmm? She’s meeting with someone...’
>I see Laila turn to the unknown figure
>The figure comes closer and I still can’t really see who it is
>”So, why’d you want to meet me here?” the clearly familiar male voice asks
>”I...wanted to ask you something.” Laila says and I notice her tail wagging slightly
>”Fire away.” I can't quite see the guy's features clearly but he looks like an anthro
>She straightens her stance
>”Would you..." Her ears flatten against her head and her stance grows shyer "...Like to go out with me?"
>”Well of course I would like to.” He comes closer and pats her
>”Oh, really? I thought that you’d never accept!” She hugs the guy
>’Wait, that’s...Jyrki. The lucky son of a bitch.’
>Get up and slowly retreat, making sure neither hears me and I walk back drowsily to the house
>Slowly open the front door and enter the small entryway
>Throw shoes off and go back to the living room
>Drop jacket and flop myself on the couch and I grab a pillow and lay my face on it
>The door once again clicks open and then comes sounds of clothes rustling
>They soon fade and the sound of door being opened and then closed resound
>’Motherfucker.’ I turn around a little before finding a comfortable position to sleep in
>...
>’Worst morning awakening yet.’
>Throw off the blanket and raise myself from the couch lazily
>I grab my jacket and go outside and I pick the left direction and start walking
>After hazily walking through the city, find myself on a grassy hill looking over the sea
>Take a deep breath
>”UOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHH!”
>Take a few breaths and sit down
>”Oh, Anon. Was that you just now?” Comes a feline voice from the right
>”Faye!? Did...you hear that just now?” I turn my head to the tracksuit wearing cat
>She simply nods and I cover my face with my hands
>”Oh Christ...I didn’t think someone would hear it.”
>”Why were you yelling anyway?” She jogs to me and sit downs next to me
>”I was, uh... clearing my mind.” I try to maintain my dignity
>She bursts into a laughing mess
>”D-Don’t laugh! It’s a legit thing I do!”
>”S-Sorry, but seriously?” She wipes her eyes a bit
>”Yeah. I do that when I’m frustrated or something.”
>”Hmm.” She brings herself up
>”UUUUOOOOHHH!” I almost jump at her sudden yell
>”Wonder if it worked?” She then sits down
>”Well, how do you feel?”
>”Pretty good right now, to be honest.”
>”That means it works.” I give a thumbs-up
>”What were you yelling about, if you don’t mind me asking.” I cross my legs and feel the morning breeze blow through my hair
>”I was yelling because my brother is being a jackass who doesn’t clean up after himself.”
>”Ok? You live with your brother?”
>”Yeah, and by the way, what were you yelling about then?”
>”I was...because I was a bit frustrated, obviously” I wave my hand
>”Oh, okay. So, how about that wind?” She stands up and spreads her arms out
>I raise myself as well
>”It’s nice.” I close my eyes and feel like I’m about to lift off the ground
>”Hey Anon, wanna come do a morning jog with me?” she starts stretching a little
>”Morning jog?” I rub the back of my neck a little. “Why not. We going around the city?”
>”Yeah.” She takes a slow jogging pace and I follow behind her
>We jog through the slowly waking city and we end up at a small house in the north part of the city, whereas we started in the western side
>”Hah...hah..” my aching body manages to hold itself together
>”Already...out of breath? Come on, we ain’t done yet!” Faye says, even though she’s breathing pretty heavily herself
>”I’m not done yet…” I try to take a step before falling over
>”Hey! You okay?” She manages to catch me
>”Just a bit tired…” I say before taking a long intake of air
>”We’re close to my house, so we can rest up there. I’ll carry you there.” She puts me down and positions herself to give me a piggyback ride
>”Oh, thanks.” I climb onto her back and she, surprisingly, can walk well even with me on her back
>’Is she an Amazon or something?’
>She carries me to her house and lets me down, my legs not aching as much anymore
>Then she opens the door and signals me to go in
>Go in and throw myself on the beanbag chair lying in what I’m guessing is the living room
>”Aaaahhh, that’s the stuff right there.” I relax completely and close my eyes
>”Don’t fall asleep on me now.” Faye says
>”I’ll try not to.” I open my eyes and see the cat taking off her tracksuit jacket
>She wears a black sports bra underneath the jacket and I bare witness to her perky chest and lightly toned stomach that's noticeable even with her curly fur 
>Turn my head quickly the other way
>”Checking me out, are you?” I can feel her smirk even though I don’t see it
>”N-no, I just happened to..” I slowly turn my head and now I get a view of her broad lower body that is only slightly covered by black shorts
>”You just “happened to”, huh?” She turns her sweaty self to me
>”I’m uh...gonna go take a shower.” I get up and randomly pick a direction
>”The shower is that way.” She points to the door behind her, open door revealing a bathroom
>Silently switch heading and go to the bathroom
>”And if you gonna wank, be sure to clean up.” She hails as I close the door
>”What gave you that idea?” Open the door a bit to face her
>Her eyes trail downwards
>Look down as well
>”Oh.”
>Slowly close the door and lock it
>’Might as well.’
>...
>”Hey, I brought you some of my brother’s clothes ‘cause you don’t appear have spares with you.” Faye says from outside the door
>”Thanks!” I yell back as I dry myself and unlock the bathroom door
>Open the door and pick off the neatly placed clothes off the floor
>”Looking good~” Faye’s voice purrs from the couch and I quickly close the door
>”C-Could you not!?”
>”What? You were checking me out too.”
>”That was not intentional!”
>’A pink T-shirt and and dark-blue shorts. There’s something off about them though.’ I quickly put on my boxers and then put on Faye’s brother clothes
>Exit the bathroom and see Faye laying on the couch and see that the cat is wearing a tanktop and short-shorts
>”You really like to show off your legs, don’t you?” I snort as I flop back on the beanbag chair
>”I just like to wear short-shorts.” She brings her left leg up and then down
>”Oh really now…”
>’I forgot, I should probably text Laila that I’m currently here.’
>Get up and go back to the bathroom and search my pant pocket
>’There it is.’
>’Wha-’ I notice that I have about forty messages from Laila
>All of them questions about where I am and am I okay
>Reply: “I’m at Faye’s rn and I’m okay. No need to worry.”
>The next message from came quickly
>”Oh thank goodness! I was so worried when I couldn’t find you. Why are you at Faye’s?”
>”She invited me to morning jog and I got a bit tired and we’re resting at her house.”
>”Oh. I’m at work, so could you go look after Franz?
>”Yeah, I will.” I place the phone in the shorts’s pocket and go back to the living room
>”Hey Faye. Got a plastic bag anywhere?”
>”Why do you need that?”
>”I gotta go back to the house and I don’t wanna leave my clothes here.”
>Faye rolls herself off the couch and goes to search for the plastic bag
>A few seconds later, she returns with a simple white plastic bag
>”Here. Go get your clothes and I’ll show you the way back.”
>”Thanks.” Grab the bag and get my clothes from the bathroom
>Go to the front door and see Faye ready to leave
>”Got everything?”
>”Yep.”
>She opens the door and we exit the house
>Then she closes the door and we get on our way
>”So Anon, you got a crush on Laila?”
>”Why’d you think that?”
>”You were glancing at her like every point five seconds the other day”
>’That obvious?’
>”Well i did have a crush on her, but I found out yesterday that she’s going out with someone, so...”
>”Ouch.”
>”Ouch indeed. That’s why I was yelling back at the hill. But-” I stop and feel something wrap around my chest
>”What are you doing?”
>Giving you a cheer-up hug.” She gives a small smile and lets go of me
>”Well...thanks.”
>Shortly after, we arrive at Laila’s house
>”Wonder if she already left.” I open the door and enter the house
>”Hi big bro!” The boy waves from the couch and then turns away to play LBP
>”Oh hi Franz. Faye's here with me too” I go to bathroom in hopes of washing my clothes
>"Hi boy!"
>Enter the bathroom and put my clothes in the wash
>Close the washing machine
>Turn on the washing machine and exit the bathroom
>”Should I order pizza?” Faye sits on the couch and gets her phone out
>”Go ahead.” I sit down next to her
>She fiddles with her phone for a bit and then puts it down
>”Done. Now, what should we do?” 
>”Chat about things? Get to know each other.”
>”Alright, what you wanna talk about?” Faye leans back on the couch
>”Well, do you have any hobbies?” I put my elbow on the couch’s armrest and rest my head on my hand
>”I do judo. And I like to sing.” She brings up two fingers
>”Judo? What belt?”
>”Green belt.”
>”Huh, well I sorta expected you’d be good at it since you got the perfect body for it.”
>”And you say you weren’t checking me out.” She grins at me
>”No comment. And what about your singing?”
>”I just do it as a small hobby, but it’s pretty fun.”
>”Agreed.” I nod my head
>”You sing too?” She looks honestly surprised
>”Yeah, is that odd or something?” I blink a couple times and then rub the back of my neck
>”No, I just wasn’t expecting for you to like it as well.” She scratches her chin slightly
>”And uh... What about your hobbies?” She points at me
>”I build model-kits sometimes.”
>”Like airplanes and stuff?”
>Take out my phone and go to my picture gallery
>”More like this.” I show her a picture of one of my kits that I built last year
>”Oooh, looks cute.” She gets a closer look 
>”It’s YG-111 G-Self.”
>”What’s it from?” She blinks and then looks at me
>”From a show called Gundam: Reconguista in G.”
>”Huh. Never heard of it."
>”What are you two doing? Let me see!” Franz gets down from the couch and tries to get a look at my phone
>”Wow! That looks so cool!” The boy’s tail wags at high speeds and I think it’s about lift him off the ground
>”It’s a Gunpla model-kit. You wanna build one sometime?” I ask him as I pull away my phone
>”Yeah!” he gleams and I pat the precious boy
>”I’ll bring you one when I visit again.”
>”Yay!” He jumps on me and hugs me, then sits down next to Faye
>”And Anon, you got any other hobbies?” The cat pokes Franz’s cheek a little and turns her eyes to me
>”I play video games. That kinda seems obvious though.” I shrug and turn my eyes away
>”Yeah, seems like everybody plays video games and watches anime these days. Got anything else?” She stops poking the boy and now tries to poke my cheek
>”Not really.” I push her finger away with the back of my hand and she just tries to poke me with her other paw

>She loses her balance and falls onto my lap
>”...Mind if I stay here for a bit?” She turns on her side
>”Sure?” I end up staring at her, from top to bottom this time
>'Let's try something.'
>Slyly move my left hand behind her ear
>Move index and middle finger up and down
>I can almost hear her going “!?”
>”Anon? What are you-” I move my hand while scratching
>She stops talking and just lays there
>Continue scratching for a bit before going to stroke her fur
>Place my hand on the top of head and move my hand downwards
>”Mmmm, that feels so good.” She purrs as I pet her
>Notice her tail moving and use my left hand to pet that
>Start at the bottom
>’Huh, so she has a hole in her shorts for her tail to fit through.’
>Touch the floofy tail's base
>Faye jerks a bit
>”D-Did you just touch my tail?” She looks at me with widened eyes
>”Yes, why? Is it sensitive?”
>”Yep.”
>Touch
>”Oi!”
>”What’s the matter?” I grin at her
>Touch again
>”You motherfu..” She stops as the doorbell rings
>”Must be the pizza.” I say and Faye jumps off and goes to the door
>’Where’d she pull that money from?’
>She opens the door and says hello to the pizza-deliverer
>Franz is still playing and I get up
>Go to the door
>”Eating with your boyfriend? Hope you have a nice day.” The female human takes the money pawed by Faye
>”Yeah. Have a good day!” She takes the pizza and bottle of coke and paws them to me
>She then closes the door
>I start to go to the couch before stopping after the first step
>”Wait, boyfriend?” I turn my head to Faye, who’s just smiling there
>”How about it? We would make a cute couple.”
>”Isn’t that kinda rushing it?” I go and sit down on the couch and set the pizza on the stool and the bottle on the floor
>”Maybe, but…” The cat sits down close to me and licks my cheek “...You’re too cute to pass up.”
>”Hey little boy. Wanna watch something with us?” Faye glances at Franz
>”Hmm? Uh, okay. What are we watching?” He turns off the game he’s playing and turns to us
>”Maybe we’ll just watch stuff that comes up on tv.” Faye says as she goes over to get the remote from the shelf under the tv
>She bends over and i quickly take out my phone and snap a picture
>Place phone back in the pocket and Faye then turns to the tv
>She switches from the hdmi to the antennae and then surfs through a couple channels
>”Look. They’re playing some action flicks on this channel.” She says and then suddenly rests herself on my lap
>She takes a slice of pizza and puts it up to my mouth
>Take a bite out of it and she then eats the rest
>”Oh come on now.” I take the next slice and quickly eat it
>...
>After a good five hours of watching the movies and a show and a documentary, me and Faye see that Franz fell asleep at some point
>”Huh…” I say as Faye gets off my lap
>I pick up the boy and move him to Laila’s room
>The room has a simple bed, a closet and a desk with a desktop on it
>Place Franz on the bed and leave the room
>”So, what now?” I sit back on the couch and rustle my hair
>Faye walks to me from the closed front window
>She sits on my lap while facing me
>”Anon, we should do something….exciting~” She whisper the last part to my ear
>”What are you suggesting?” I smirk as I roll my hands under her tanktop and feel up her sides
>She licks her lips and slides her crotch into close contact with mine
>I slide my hands against her fur and soon feel her chest against my hands
>Play with her breasts lightly and close my face to hers
>Her lips feel smooth to mine and I slide my tongue into her mouth
>She makes a small moan as she answers with her own tongue
>Move my hands to remove her top and her curly fur feels furry on my hands
>She pulls her mouth away from mine, with a slight string of saliva connecting us
>”Anon…”
>”AHEM.” A loud cough comes from behind and we turn to see Laila standing at the door
>”What are you two doing?” She looks a bit mad, scratch that, really mad
>”Making love?” Faye answers bluntly and I feel my body freeze up at the dog's death stare
>”On my couch.”
>”Yes.” Faye hugs me and I slide my hand out of her top “..You jealous?”
>”Not in the slightest.” Laila puffs and takes off her jacket and hangs it on the wall
>”Where’s Franz?” She asks and I turn my head away from her gaze
>”He’s sleeping in your room.” Faye points to said room
>”And that makes it okay to do stuff on my couch? Wait, don’t answer.” The dog then goes to the bathroom
>”I’m gonna go take a shower and god help me if I see or hear you two doing more stuff in my presence.”
>”She’s actually mad.” Faye whispers to me and tries to hold back her giggles
>Faye gets off me and sits next to me
>”So, uhhhh….Wanna do the rest some other day?” She turns to me
>”..Y-Yeah.” I roll my eyes away and rub the back of neck
>”Let’s meet again tomorrow okay?” She stands up
>”Want my phone number?” I ask as I pull out my phone
>”Oh yeah, thanks.” She takes my phone and opens it
>”That’s what I look from behind? Nice.”
>’AH FUCK.’
>She does something on my phone and then gives it to me
>”I gave you my number and did a thing, hope you enjoy.”
>Look at my phone and see that she swapped my wallpaper for that picture of her ass
>The front door clicks open and the cat waves goodbye to me
>Wave back
>The door closes and I then lay on the couch
>’Welp, that was an...interesting experience.’
>”Anon, I can't believe you were gonna screw her on my couch.” Laila’s voice comes from the direction of the bathroom
>”Sorry, I just went with the flow of things.” I just stare at the ceiling and hope she just leaves
>She probably goes to her room, judging by the door creaks, and I let out a sigh
>’Wrong time at the wrong place, I guess.'
>The rest of the evening goes awkwardly with Laila not saying much to me
>Just about to go to sleep on the couch and I think about what I should do with Faye tomorrow
>’I’m at least gonna do her.’
>Sleep comfortably that night
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 4 [contains lewd through lines 897 - 935]

>I sit on the grassy hill overlooking the sea with the noon sun hanging brightly in the sky
>”Hey big bro, why are we here?” Franz asks me as he closes his hoodie and drops the hood over his head
>”We’re waiting here for Faye.” I finish eating sandwich that Laila made for lunch
>”It’s cooold…” He’s practically shivering in this wind, though it’s only a small breeze
>”You can come sit closer to me if you’re too cold just standing there.”
>”Okay, thanks big bro.” He huddles up next to me and I throw my right arm around him
>”Warmer?” I smile and look at him
>”Mmm. You’re so warm big bro.” He nuzzles against my side
>”Anon, I didn’t know you were that kind of person~” The familiar voice of Faye sneaks up from behind as her arms embrace me by the neck
>”Nah, he was just a bit cold and I just gave him some warmth.”
>Faye snorts and I just sigh
>”Oh hi Faye! We were just waiting for you!” Franz lets go of me and stands up to wave at the feline
>”Hello there, little boy. So, Anon...” She also lets me go as I stand up and turn to her “...What are we gonna do?”
>”I was thinking about going to a cafe. You two fine with that?” I glance at Franz and then back to Faye
>”a white long-sleeve under a black jacket, grey jeans and jet-black ankle boots. 9/10 I’d say.” I scan her body from top-to-bottom
>”Thanks, I put these on just for you.” She winks and flips a peace sign
>”Hey, why don’t we also go shopping for some clothes today as well? Since I’ve got only these clothes to wear and I’d like to see what this city’s stores have.”
>”Sounds like a plan. Shopping or going to cafe, which one first?” The cat snaps her fingers
>”Any good cafes nearby you’d recommend?”
>”There’s one that I frequent. We can go there.” Faye takes out her phone and shows me a picture of the cafe
>”Let’s go then. Franz?” I look at the boy on my left as he stares at us curiously
>He nods and grabs my left hand with his right and Faye hold my right hand in her left
>We start walking to the cafe, following Faye’s directions
>...
>”Hey Anon, you ever date anyone?” Faye asks, still holding fast onto my hand
>”Yeah, did for a while and then we broke up.” I take a deep breath through my nose as I flashback to those days
>”Why’d you two break?”
>I grimace a little and turn my eyes to the ground
>”Oh, sorry. It’s a touchy subject?”
>”Yeah… Anyway, yesterday you mentioned about you being a green belt at judo?” I look at her and smile
>”Yep, been doing it for a few years now. It’s pretty fun. Built up a bit of muscle for me as a result.” She flexes her right arm proudly
>”I’m not really into martial arts or any physical sport really. School pretty much put me off on most sports. I once twisted my left ankle during school P.E while playing basketball, had to use a brace and walking sticks for a couple weeks.”
>”Uuggh. Sounds pretty nasty.” She disgustedly looks at my leg
>”It was pretty bad.” I feel a tug on my left hand “What’s up Franz?”
>”Big bro, i’m tired...” He whines and I stop and let my hands go
>”You can ride on my back if you want.”I crouch to him and he climbs on my back, arms loosely around my neck and legs under my arms
>”Everything good?” I ask as I get up and feel Franz getting himself to a good position
>”Yeah!” He rests his tightens his grip and his furry arms tickling against my neck which makes me giggle a little
>”But I’m tired from walking too.” Faye pouts and crosses her arms
>”I’ll carry you to bed tonight, how’s that?” I start walking again and Faye follow next to me
>”Smooth operator over here” She pinches my cheek lightly
>”Heh. How close is that cafe, by the way?” We turn the corner and Faye points to a old-looking building on the left
>”That’s it.” She says as I turn to look at the metal sign with engraved letters
>”Cafe Antula.” I say outloud as I let Franz back down and we then follow Faye inside the building
>The door’s bell rings as the cat opens the door and I look around
>’Place looks like it’s from the 50’s, looks neatly kept though.’ We sit down at a table for four, Faye sitting at the windowside, I sit next to her and Franz sits opposite of us
>”Welcome, what would you like to order?” Comes a cheery male voice
>’He looks-’
>”You look like Faye.” Franz points innocently at the lean cat
>”Franz, it’s rude to point.” Faye says and the boy shrinks back and puts down his arm
>”Sorry…” He turns to the male cat again
>”It’s no problem. And sis, what’s going on here?” His tone changes to a more strict one when he turns to look at Faye
>”I’m just hanging out with Anon here.” She hugs my right arm
>”Hmmm. What about the kid?” I notice the cat having slightly less curly fur than Faye, but the same shade of grey
>”I’m just helping a friend take care of him. I couldn’t leave him alone in the house. And yeah, I’m Anon.” I go to shake his paw, but he just goes for a fistbump and I quickly switch over
>”Cool, I’m Aki, Faye’s big brother.” He bumps and then fixes his uniform’s tie a little
>”So, what would you three like to order?” He continues with a winning smile and hands us menu pamphlets he was carrying under his left arm
>”I’ll take…” Quickly flip through the paper “...a coke, thanks.”
>”Alright, what about you two?” He looks at the two who are looking at the menu
>”I’m gonna have a strawberry smoothie. Franz?” Faye meets eyes with the boy
>”Uh...Umm...A smoothie as well, please.” Franz says and ducks his face back behind the menu
>”Ok, I’ll bring your orders shortly.” Aki leaves with a wave of his hand and I glance at the raised tail behind him
>”Ow.” I flinch a little as I feel a strong pinch on my right thigh
>”You’re only allowed to stare at my ass.” Faye pinches harder and I feel something also getting hard
>”Yeah, ok. Just...stop pinching my leg.”
>”One last pinch and…” She pinches hard and then lets go
>”F... Seriously?”
>”You were doing pretty much the same to me yesterday.” She scoffs and flicks her tail
>”Yeah, but I didn't pinch.” I rub my thigh slightly
>”Did it hurt that bad?” She brings her paw closer to my thigh again
>”A bit.”
>”Sorry about that.” She pulls her paw back and scratches the back of her head with it
>”Just don’t pinch that hard again, ok?” I pat her and then notice Aki coming over with our drinks
>”Here you go.” He places a tray down and we take our respective drinks
>”Thanks.” Me and Faye say at the same time and laugh after
>”Thank you.” Franz simply says and starts to sip on his strawberry smoothie
>We drink while making some small-talk
>”Be sure to visit us again!” The gruff-looking female wolf at the counter calls while waving as we leave
>Smile and wave at her and then leave the establishment
>”Now, let’s go shopping.” I stretch my arms from side-to-side “...Hey Faye, are there any clothing stores nearby?”
>”Yeah, I’ll lead you.” She starts walking and then crosses the street
>I take Franz’s paw and we follow her
>...
>”How about this shirt and vest?” She takes a black t-shirt and a grey vest out and holds them up
>”Looks good. I’ll go try them on.”  I go to the store’s dressing room and lock the door behind me
>Take off my jacket and long-sleeved shirt, fold them and put them down on the wooden seat to my left
>Put on the t-shirt and vest and then exit the dressing room
>”How do I look? Handsome?” I stand with a hand on my hip as Faye looks at me while scratching her chin
>”More like cute.” She states and continues staring at me
>”There goes my pride, but I guess that's good enough.” Sigh and then go back into the dressing room to change
>”Am I cute?” I hear Franz ask as I put on my long-sleeve
>”Of course you are!” Sounds of lowly whimpering come right after
>Get my jacket on and walk out of the dressing room
>”Faye, don’t bully him.” I hold the store clothes in my hands as I look to the cat holding Franz up and hugging tightly
>”I’m not bullying him, I’m just hugging him.” She pushes her cheek against Franz’s
>’That’s cute.’ A smile dawns on my face and I go over the the cashier
>”Hi, I’d like to purchase these.” I place the neat pile of clothes on the counter
>”Alrighty.”  The man takes the scans the tags of the clothes
>”Would you like a bag to carry these with?”
>”Yeah, thanks.” I say and he then takes out a plastic bag, put the clothes in and hands the bag to me
>”Here you go, that’ll be 44,50 euros.” He says and I hand him a fifty euro bill
>”Thank you and have a good day.” He gives the 4,50 euro change
>”Same to you.” I wave to him and exit the store, noticing Faye and Franz already left
>”What should we do next?” Faye asks while crouched and poking the dog boy’s cheek
>”Hmm, wanna go to the park?” I look around a little and see that other people are now starting to walk about
>”Fine by me.” She gets up and takes my hand
>”Are we gonna go meet Jyrki again?” Franz wonders as he climbs on my back again
>”Yep.” I shift the boy clinging onto my back and then I start walking
>...
>”I think the boy fell asleep.” Faye whispers to me and then pokes the boy
>”Seems like it.” I enter the park once again
>”Yo Anon.” A voice comes from behind a tree and out steps Jyrki with his paws stashed in his pant pockets
>Nod my head to him and he walks closer
>”Is he sleeping?” He asks and takes his paws out of his pockets
>”Yeah. I don’t get how he fell asleep while being carried on my back.” I chuckle
>”Kids are weird creatures aren’t they?” Faye chimes in
>”Who is she?”
>”Oh, I forgot to introduce you. This is Faye.” I say and she waves to the wolfhound
>”Nice meeting you Faye, I’m Jyrki.” He goes to shake paws
>”Likewise and Anon told me about you on the way here.” She shake his paw while giving a smile
>”Mmm..”
>”Franz, you awake?” I feel his little body move and he moves his face that his muzzle fur rolls over my neck, forcing a small giggle from me
>”Big bro?” He hugs my neck with a sleepy grip and yawns
>’Can I just take him home with me?’
>”I’m here, we’re at the park.” I let him down and he then yawns again
>The boy then grabs my hand with his paw
>”Sleep well?” I ask and he looks at me with hazy eyes
>He yawns once more and waves to Jyrki right after
>We go around the park and we stop near Jyrki’s spot
>”I’m gonna go to the toilet, so watch the kid for me ok?” I let go of the boy’s paw and hand the plastic bag to Faye and then start walking to the public toilets
>...
>’That took a while.’ I flush the toilet and go to wash my hands
>I go to the sink and turn the water on
>’It’s been… How many years since that day?’ Wash my hands and then dry them
>Go back out and see Faye looking around frantically
>”What’s wrong?” I walk up her and she looks at me nervously
>”We...lost Franz.” She turns her eyes away from me
>”What? Where did you lose him?” I say, hiding my rising panic
>”Me and Jyrki were talking when we noticed Franz was gone. I’m gonna go look near the entrance.” She runs off and I go the opposite way
>’I just hope to God he wasn’t kidnapped.’
>After a solid five minute of searching, I’m starting to really panic
>Multiple ‘worst-case scenarios’ play in my head as my searching turns more panicky
>”Oh god, i just hope-” I whisper to myself before seeing Franz running to me
>”Hi big bro!”
>”Where did you run off to? We were worried about you.” I crouch to eye-level with him
>”Sorry...but that girl there just wanted someone to play with.”
>I turn my eyes to the small human girl staring at us from behind a tree
>”You could have asked Faye or Jyrki that you wanted to go play.” I place my hand on his head
>”You can’t just run off like that.” I pat him a couple times before standing up
>Get my phone out and text Faye that I found Franz
>”Let’s go back.” I start walking and the boy follows me but doesn’t grab my hand
>”...Are you mad at me?” He shyly asks while staring at the ground
>”No. There’s no reason for me to get mad at you.”
>”Really?” His voice almost quivers
>”Really.”
>He takes my hand and he gets spring to his step
>We walk a little before bumping into Jyrki and Faye
>”Franz, please don’t run off like that again.” Faye sighs and pats him
>She then hands me the plastic bag back
>”Sorry…” His face turns downwards again
>”Hey Jyrki, wanna take Franz to Laila’s?” I place my hand on his shoulder
>”Why me?” He bewilderedly asks and I lean in closer
>”Dude, so that you can get things going with her, if you catch my drift.” I whisper to him while wiggling my eyebrows
>”Uh, ok? But where are you going?” He also lowers his voice
>I do a OK sign with my left hand and stick out my right index finger
>Move my right hand closer to my left
>”You feeling me?” I smirk and he just stares at me
>”I get you, but with who?”
>Faye taps my shoulder just as he finishes talking
>”Anon, I’m gonna go to my place now.”
>”I’m coming along.” I turn to face her
>”Hmm? What about the boy?” Faye points to said boy
>”Jyrki is gonna take him to the Laila’s house.”
>”Oh. Does he know where she lives?”
>”Yeah I do.” Jyrki simply replies
>”Okay then, me and Anon are gonna be going now. Bye!” She slides her arm under mine and almost drags me along with her
>I try to stay at her pace as we walk out
>”So~ What are we gonna do?” She throws a cocky smile
>”I think we both know what we’re gonna do.”
>”Fuck till out of stamina/condoms?”
>”A bit direct of an answer, but yeah.”
>She giggles and picks up the pace as do I
>...
>We reach her house and take off our clothes in with a bit of excitement tingling in the air
>I slowly join Faye on the couch, a smile cutting across her face "You sure are happy to do this Anon."
>I can't believe this is happening still, simply grinning back at her as I fiddle with a condom and try to smoothly put it on
>We haven't even done anything yet and my knees are weak, and my arms are heavy, though not as much as my very first time having sex
>I'm doing my absolute best not to spill my spaghetti, meaning pretty well "Why wouldn't I be with someone as sexy as you?"
>Faye's ears twitch and her tail grazes my nude form teasingly, her grin going full cheshire as she bends over in a canine like position with her tail raised
>With the condom finally on I carefully press against her, rubbing up and down her somewhat small and thin opening carefully
>She bites her finger and looks at me with an excited but cautious glance, waiting for me to go further
>I slowly in forward into her supple form, watching as her bite loosens and her eyes lose their intense focus to pleasure
>I watch carefully, unaware I run out of length as Faye's eyes roll back for a moment and she purrs happily
>My hips move of their own accord as I pull back and nearly out of her, slowly pushing back down into her as she shudders with pleasure again
>Faye's insides threaten to choke the life out of my lower half as I give gentle but affirmative thrusts into her, building a tempo over time
>I'm careful to go slow and slowly rock up my beat every few seconds, but her hungry stare as I take my time tells me she wants a bit more
>I gently bend her back down just a bit and lean forward as I continue to speed up inside of her, doing my best to give her smooth and loving experience
>It really isn't that long of this intense rhythmic thrusting before I can feel her body shaking a bit, Faye looking back over her shoulder at me
>Faye looks like she's about to explode, gritting her teeth as her tail twitches wildly
>A moment later her eyes open as wide as possible and her body is wracked with an orgasm that causes her to stop for a moment underneath my loving embrace
>Her body threatens to push me to the edge with how hard it clamps, but I push it back just a bit longer 
>After a short interlude of lethargic gentle thrusts Faye turns pulls away and turns to face me, a smile crossing her face as she gentle straddles me and moves my hands to her hips
>As if to thank her I grip her hips and guide them a bit as she takes control, causing her happy purring to reach dangerously loud levels
>Instead of going a bit fast like we had been, Faye is slowly pushing me forward with intense and slow grinding strokes over me
>I'm pulling her hips back and forth with every slow grinding push against me, doing my best not to make a silly face from the intense feeling of Faye purring on top of me
>I can feel myself slowly pressing into the edge of her supple form with every stroke of her hips, and I struggle not to immediately finish in the hopes Faye can get a bit more out of this
>Like all good things though, I can tell that the end for me is just around the corner and ask her to slow down just a bit while taking a vice grip on her fluffy hips
>Uhhh.... what do I do now, I'm getting closer with every thrust and neither of us can really hold back from the finish line
>Even as Faye is doing her best to slow down her grinding, the intensity of her passion isn't making this too much easier
>Think fast, me!
>uhhhh...
>Cats bite into their mates as they finish right?
>Faye's gonna love that~
>Leaning as close as I can to Faye's neck, I notice her fur bristles with excitement under my breath
>Faye isnt even consciously responding to my advance as I carefully take a firm nibble into the side of her neck, biting into a surprisingly ample amount of waiting fur as I watch her eyes roll back into her head
>We both finish together, Faye taking a few extra strokes of her hips as the condom begins to balloon up inside of her
>Intense arousal and love show on her face as Faye seems to orgasm fiercely again as I twitch inside of her
>As a gentle thank you of sorts I slowly push back and forth at the very ends of her supple insides, slowly pulling out and being greatful the condom held up the entire time
>I take a moment to realize I'm still leaned into her, biting her neck and let my grip on her go completely
>I lay down on the couch as Faye rolls off of me, her chest rising and falling with excitement in our post sex bliss
>It takes a minutes or so for us to come back from the blissful trance we're stuck in to talk
>”Oh my Jesus... That was pretty good for my first time.” She flops onto me and hugs me
>"Good for you then." I pet her warm and sweaty body as she continues to purr
>I look at the clock hanging on the wall and notice that it’s 19:27, it having been 18:54 when we started
>New record, but i guess that’s not saying a lot
>I take off the used rubber and throw it in the trash and turn my attention back to the affectionate cat
>”Wanna go to sleep or stay up?” I scratch behind her ear a little as I ask
>”I’m tired and wanna sleep next to you. And you’re gonna carry me to me bed, bridal style.” She hugs me tightly and nuzzles her furred face onto my side as I pick her and myself up
>”Not as heavy as I expected. Ow.” I take a small flick of the finger to my forehead
>”Rude. And my bedroom’s that way.” She points to the first door on the right
>”Okay, let’s go then, princess.” I say that last part with a tone of smug
>”Flattering for a guy who bites during sex.”
>”That was...just a instinctual thing." I say awkwardly
>”Yeah right. you're just are a kinky guy, aren't you?” She covers her smug grin with her hand and giggles
>”No comment once again. Wanna open the door?” I motion to the door and she opens it with her left paw
>Her bedroom looks fairly plain, wooden double bed with fluffy looking mattress, pillows and smooth sheets
>There’s a tv on a large stand with doors and drawers on it
>I stop looking around and place her on the bed where she rolls herself away to the other pillow and pat the spot next to her
>I lay down on my side next to her and she pulls the sheets over both of bodies and then snuggles herself to my body
>”Hey Faye.” I pet the back of her head and she raises herself eye-level to me
>”Yeah?”
>”Wanna go on a date tomorrow? Since there’s a convention happening and I thought I’d take you there.”
>”Oh how sweet of you. I'll take you up on that.” She kisses and then tightly hugs me
>Return her embrace, close my eyes and just listen to her breathing and feel her warmth
>”Good night.”
>”Same to you.”
>’It’s just like that first night…’
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 5

>The next early morning goes off to a fairly uneventful start as the sun rises
>Me and Faye say our good mornings and brush our teeth, eat breakfast and take quick shower and get dressed
>”Should we go to Laila’s to see how she and Franz are doing?” I ask as I set my new vest, which feels nicely light on me
>”Let’s do that.” The grey-furred cat comes next to me, dressed in the same outfit as yesterday and we exit the house while holding hands
>...
>Ring the doorbell and the door opens shortly after
>”Who is here this early in the morn- Oh it’s you Anon. And Faye as well.” Laila yawns and motions for us to come in
>She goes to make tea for us and we all go into the kitchen and sit down at the table
>”So Laila, how’d it go with Jyrki yesterday?” I sip my tea and take in the sweet taste
>”What do you mean?” She puts a couple sugar cubes in her tea and stirs it a little with a spoon
>”You’re going out with him, right? So you must have done something yesterday.”
>”Not really. We just took care of Franz. We’re...gonna go on a date today though.”
>”Nice.” Faye chimes in and gulps her tea, only to fan her mouth a little after
>”Was it too hot?” Laila asks concernedly 
>”A bit…” the cat whines cutely
>I chuckle and Faye gives a light elbow jab to my side
>”Heh, sorry. By the way Laila, are you going to that convention?”
>”That’s where me and Jyrki are gonna have our date.” Her tail wags excitedly
>”Make that a double date. We’re coming along too.” Faye pulls me to her by my arm and I luckily manage to keep the tea in the cup
>”Oh? A double date. hmmm, sounds interesting. I’ll tell that to Jyrki. And we’ll have to take Franz along too.”
>”That’s fine, though it’s pretty funny that we would go on a double date and then bring a kid along with us.” Faye giggles and goes over to the fridge
>”Got any...Ah, there’s some good ol’ Dr.Pep a.k.a, the best soda in the world” She takes a liter bottle and gets a small glass to drink from
>”I’m not that big of a fan, but I just bought it because it was on sale.” Laila sips the last of her tea and sets the cup in the sink
>”Me neither. It’s good, but I’d say Fanta is better.”I take mine and Faye’s cups and put the in the sink as well
>”No one asked you two.”
>”I’ll still drink some though.” I take a glass from the drawer and pour some soda for myself
>”I won’t take any. I’m gonna go see if Jyrki and Franz are up yet.”
>Faye almost chokes on her drink and I pat her back a couple times to help
>”T-Thanks. And what? Is Jyrki here too? I didn’t see anyone on the couch.”
>I lean in closer to Faye
>”That probably just means he slept with her on the same bed.”
>”Heh, “slept”. Heheh.” The cat hardly can contain her giggling and I can’t really control myself either
>Laila leans from the door and see us cackling lowly like a bunch of kids talking about weenies
>”What are you two cackling there about?”
>”Hehh, n-nothing. Did..did you sleep with Jyrki?” Faye tries to keep her shit together, but can’t
>”Not...yet.” Laila’s fur puffs a little and she looks at the ground
>”Ooooooo~” Me and Faye say together and she whisper something
>”Shut it you two.” Laila then walks off
>”Hey. You think she’s into some kinky shit? Like biting for example?”
>”You’re not gonna let that biting thing go, are you?” I sigh and take a drink
>”Why would I not, it was really hot. Bite me again.” She shows the other side her neck
>I put my mouth over her fur and don’t bite immediately
>”Oh stop with the teasing.”
>Bite lightly and nibble on her skin
>She starts purring and I try seeing what biting harder will do
>Just makes her excitedly squirm a little
>Stop biting and turn around to a sleepy-looking wolfhound at the doorway
>”Oh hi Jyrki.” I wave to him with a full smile
>”...Morning.” He looks away and goes to the restroom
>”Think he saw?” Faye drinks the rest of her soda and leans on me
>”Probably.” I drink mine as well
>Rest of the morning goes smoothly and we hang around Laila’s house until 10 am when the convention opens
>The time flows by and we find ourselves in the yard between three buildings
>”Alright, what should we do first?” I open the pamphlet I picked up from the entrance
>”I’m gonna go shopping, there’s probably figures and books for sale at the market, you wanna come along Faye?” I look at the grey cat as she looks around
>”Yeah okay. I gotta hand it to these people, they really put effort into their cosplaying.” She glances at a group of people cosplaying in high-quality (Depending on who you ask) apparel
>”What are you two gonna do then?” Faye questions while taking my hand
>”Could you hand me that?” Jyrki points to the pamphlet and I hand it to him
>He checks it out and shows Laila something on it
>”A cafe sounds nice.” She smiles and looks to Franz
>”Wanna come with us or go shopping with Anon and Faye?”
>The boy looks like he’s having an existential crisis
>”Uhmm...I’m...Gonna go with big bro.” He takes my hand
>”Alright, we’ll meet up here at…” Quickly check the time
>”...11, maybe?”
>Everyone agrees to this and Laila and Jyrki walk off towards the western building while holding paws closely
>”Should I start playing I’m Your Baby every time we see them?”
>”Heh, you just want to sing that to me don’t you?” I start walking to the northern building with Faye and Franz at my side
>”Maybe.” She grins
>The northern building contains the bustling shopping area which is filled with stands selling art, jewelry, figurines and manga, etc etc
>We browse the shops one by one and I end up buying a few model-kits, which were surprisingly cheap
>”A Crossbone Gundam X-1 Kai and X-2 Kai as well. And both of them ver.ka…”
>’Fuckin’ A.’
>I feel a vibration in my right pant pocket and take out my phone
>’An unknown caller?’
>Open the call
>”Hello?”
>”...Hi, Anon.” I hear that familiar voice and my body turns cold for an instant
>’It’s…’
>”Hold on.” I pull the phone away from my ear and then signal Faye that I’m gonna outside for a bit
>Stand beneath the shade of a tree and put the phone near my ear again, griping the plastic bag in my left hand a bit hard
>”...Why did you call me?” I can’t help to scoff at the caller
>”I wanted to...ask if you were able to meet up again, like old times?” The female voice I could never forget asks
>”Sorry, at another city right now. Did you move back?”
>”No, I’m just visiting here for the weekend and I thought we could meet up and...talk.”
>A loud sigh escapes my mouth
>”...Fine, where and when?”
>”At the place where we first met. At 18:00 tomorrow. If that’s fine with you.”
>”I can make that. Bye.”
>”Oh uh, bye…” She closes the call and my phone beeps a couple times and then I place it back in my pocket
>Clench my right fist a couple times and then let it go
>’No use getting mad now.’
>”What’s wrong Anon?” Faye walks up to me and I just smile
>”Nothing, wanna go meet up with Laila and Jyrki?”
>”Okay.” She’s probably wondering if I’m lying about the nothing being wrong
>She’d be correct in thinking that it was a lie
>We go to the cafe on the eastern building second floor and see the two lovers drinking coffee and eating some cake on a window table 
>”Oh hi, finish your shopping?” Laila ask while feeding Jyrki some of her cake
>”Yep, mind if we sit down with you two or do you wanna do your cute couple thing?” I look as the two then look at each other and then look away
>”Y-Yeah, go ahead.” Responds Jyrki while staring outside, seems he's a bit embarrassed
>Faye and I sit down right and Franz sits down on my lap
>”So, what’s the plan now? Anything happening here now?” I scratch the boy’s fur and ask the wolfhound sitting next to me
>”There’s...a couple panels and stuff being held here… Cosplay-dating? What?” his tone is one of pure confusion
>”Seriously? Let me see that… Oh there’s actually something like that here.” Faye takes the pamphlet from Jyrki’s paws and the two girls give it a look-over
>”Huh, wonder how that works.” The cat traces the paper with her finger and probably is looking over the events
>”There’s nothing that interesting going on right now.”
>”What should we...Oh, should we take a picture?” Laila takes out her phone, the cover blanketed with cute stickers
>I’m in.” I reply and everyone else goes with it
>”Alright, let’s go out into the yard and take a picture there.” Laila eats the last of her cake and we exit the building and go under a tree to take the picture
>”Uh, excuse me.” the canine goes to random passerby and ask them to take the picture
>”Sure!” the tall female tiger, guessing a foreigner, smiles with toothy grin and takes the phone and gets ready to take the picture
>”Alright, smile!” She cheerily says and I pull my best smile without it turning into a grin and I stealthily pull Faye closer to my side
>A click later, the tiger took the picture and handed the phone back to Laila
>”Thank you very much!”
>”Anything for a cute gal like you.” The tiger pulls some finger guns while walking away
>The dog’s fur puffs a little and she brings her paws to her cheeks
>Jyrki clicks his tongue and gives a small death glare to the tiger’s back
>”Watch out the dude, you got some competition.” I smirk and Faye giggles
>”Hmph.” He scoffs to me and we decide to exit the convention
>...
>We went to Faye’s place to pick up my clothes and we then go to Laila’s, where my car sits at
>”I think that’s everything.” I say as I open my car’s passenger door and place the plastic bag and clothes on the seat
>Close the door and check my pockets for money and phone
>checked
>”Already leaving? Well, it was fun having you here for these few days.” Laila gives a friend-hug and I return the hug
>Faye clears her throat and Laila retreats herself
>The cat gives me a quick kiss on the lips and a hug to along with it
>”I’ll be sure to visit you someday, Anon. So, prepare yourself~” She boops my nose
>”I will.”
>”Hey, Anon. It was nice meeting you, do come visit this place again.” Jyrki waves and stands next to Laila
>”Big bro, when will you visit again?” Franz is already teary-eyed and I crouch down to pet him a little
>”I’ll try to visit soon, but remember I can’t come here everyday.” I kindly say to him and he smiles innocently
>”Alright, see y’all later.” I give a salute and they wave to me as I enter and start the car
>Drive it out on the street and give one last wave
>’He’s crying. I’m not leaving forever, silly.’ I grin a little and start driving
>I get some music to play and decide to play some songs I downloaded
>’Haven’t listened to this in a while, should probably watch the series again.’
>I drive back the way I came, from the city streets to a highway and then driving to the roads that lead to the downhill start of my homeroad
>”...I can be an ordinary girl… While I’m right next to you...” I sing as I reach the homely dirt road
>Drive for a minute and then turn right at the third house, going up the small up-climb onto the pebbled front yard
>”Home again.” I park my car inside the garage and reminisce about the times I helped dad do some stuff in the garage, and I then grab the plastic bag with me
>Exit the garage and enter the house proper and I remind myself of the fact that dad actually built this house, with the help of a few of friends
>I was a little kid then and used to play around the incomplete garage, fun times
>The small entryway has a brown carpet on the ground, two shelves on the right filled with miscellaneous gardening tools and some other stuff
>The first floor, I guess you could call it that, consists of one of dad’s old workshops, now a gunpla building station, and shower and sauna with the door leading to them to the left of the right-swirling staircase
>I go to the workshop and put the plastic bag down on the old wooden L-shaped table
>Then I take off my shoes, place them near the stairs and go upstairs
>The second floor has a wooden floor and ceiling with white-painted walls around, which makes for a homey feel for me
>Living room has a couch, two chairs on the right and a 42” tv on a stand
>Go to the second floor bathroom and wash my hands, a thing I always do when coming back from somewhere and the one who got me into this habit was my sister, though she probably didn’t do it intentionally
>’Guess I’ll watch some anime and then go build the gunpla i bought.’
>Dry my hands and go to the kitchen (right of the living room) and open the fridge
>Pick out a Fanta and go back to the living room
>”What to watch...Gundam, Gundam and more Gundam.”
>”G-Reco.”
>Put the first disc in the PS4 and play the first episode
>End up watching the whole show
>”It was...what, 13:00 or something when I started? What’s the time now?”
>It’s about 22:50 now
>”Fuq.”
>Sigh and go brush my teeth in the restroom
>Go to my room, which on the left side of the house coming up the stairs
>Flop down on the old bed with neatly done sheet and stuffs
>’Oh right, tomorrow I’m gonna meet up with her.’
>Close my eyes and inadvertently think back to the days of the past
>I find it hard to sleep that night
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 6 [contains lewd through lines 1246 - 1279]

>Open my eyes once again
>”Mmmgh…”I mumble into my green pillow while I pull it closer to my face
>’What’s the time?’ I roll my face to the right and look at the victorian-style clock hanging from the wall
>’10:49…What should I do for the next 6 to 7 hours?’ I try to get myself up, but manage to do the opposite and slowly find myself back in sleep
>...
>’12:34.’ I get up and stretch my arms up
>”Mmmph!”
>Exit the room and go to the kitchen to make a simple sandwich breakfast
>Eat while looking out the window, watching the really tall spruce trees in the distance
>The leaves, i guess you could call them that, sway in the wind
>It’s kind of calming, just staring at something
>”Six hours till I gotta go.” I say to myself as I look at the clock over the living room tv
>Spend a few hours building gunpla downstairs while listening to some music
>”Alright, I’ll pause and get ready.” I finish snapping together both the X-1 and X-2, but didn’t paint or topcoat either of them yet
>Go take quick shower and then for a change of clothes upstairs
>”Still fits.” I try on the old dark-blue hoodie and then put on some spare jeans
>Get myself some fingerless gloves because why not
>”Alright, is there something…” I go back to my room and search the cabinet on the right of the door
>After a bit of looking, find what I was looking for
>”There it is.” It’s a small blue necklace, nothing intricate just a simple necklace
>Put it in my right pant pocket and place my phone in the left one
>”Should I get some money along? Ah, fuck it.” I get two 10 euro bills and put them in the same pocket as the phone
>I then go downstairs and put on the same shoes i wore yesterday
>Take deep breath and exit the silent house
>”Why does she even want to meet up…” I mumble to myself as I take my bike out of the garage and check the wheels for air
>”A bit empty. Figures, since I haven’t used this in what, two months?” I get the air compressor out and start the machine and it’s loud roar always irritated me for some reason
>”..Tears of sadness and the tears of joy...”
>”After crying it is all the same~”
>”..It’ll come down the thought, these tears are from the heart...” I finish filling up on the front wheel and then go onto the back wheel
>”The goodness that we share from our heart~”
>”All the mornings when I think of you~ All the evenings when I feel for you~”
>Back wheel is also filled and I turn off the loud machine, put it back in the garage and then I hop on the bike
>’I should probably wear a helmet, but eh.’
>My phone vibrates in my pocket and I check it
>There’s a message from Faye asking about where I live
>Answer with my address and then put the phone back in my pocket
>Start biking to the small town where I was supposed to meet
>It doesn’t take long for me to reach it and I then start walking with my bike as I reach the town’s marketplace, where they hold a huge market every year
>”Alright, it’s 17:35…” Place my bike next to a bench and then sit down on the bench in front of a fountain and I feel the old wood of the bench
>’Same as always.’
>I do nothing but sit there and stare at the sky, the clouds slowly moving past above me
>Get my phone out and go to the call list
>’Should I add her back… Nah.’ My hand takes the phone back into the pocket I fling my arms up and place my hands on the back of my head
>Sigh and try to think about something else
>Time passes and I notice the sky clouding up more
>’Hope it doesn’t rain.’
>”Hello, Anon.” The voice I heard yesterday comes clearing to my ears from the right and I snap to that direction
>”O-Oh, hi…” I put my arms back down on my lap and try to relax
>”Could I sit down next to you?” The arctic fox ask and her white fur flows in the breeze and I remember the feel of it very vividly
>”Go ahead.” I bite my lower lip to calm myself a little
>”Thanks.” She smiles and carefully sit down, making sure her coat doesn’t wrinkle up or something
>Her white, fluffy tail brushes past me and lays next to me
>”How are you doing, Anon?” She asks like a mother asking a child about their day in school
>”I’m doing fine, how about you?”
>”Pretty well all things considered.” She giggles like once before
>”Well, that’s good.”
>”So uh, Anon.”
>”Yep?
>”Do you...want to try going with me again?” She asks while grasping my hand with her warm paws
>”Sorry to say, but you’re a bit late. I’m already with someone.”
>”Oh... “ She lets go and grimaces
>”And I want to apologize...For…” I swallow and the continue
>”For hitting you that day.” I turn my eyes away and clench my fist
>”Oh, right. You slapped me, but you weren’t…”
>”Wrong? Yes I was and still am. Hitting someone you love will never help anything. I was too immature to control myself and just let my anger out on you.”
>”Even though I cheated on you?”
>”Yeah, even then. It’s not right to hit anyone out of needless anger.”
>”But I cheated on you!”
>”Yes, and? I can’t forgive you for doing that, but I can try to move on from it.”
>”Move on...I don’t think I can do that.” She smiles weakly and scoffs
>”Why?”
>”Because I can’t seem to go out with anyone without thinking about that night.”
>”I don’t know if I can help you with that, but…” I turn towards her
>”But what?”
>I embrace her and place my left hand behind her head to pull her closer
>”Don’t lock yourself up because of a single mistake. People make mistakes all the time and the only thing they really can do is move on. You should do the same.” I whisper to her and then let go of the hug
>Silence, just the breeze follows
>She starts to cry madly, like she’s kept herself tied until this day
>”You suffered, haven’t you?”
>”I-I should be saying that to you! Not you to me..!” She tries to say past her quivering voice and flowing tears that wet her white fur
>”Maybe, but I think I’ve cried myself dry in these years.”
>”I-I’m so sorry, Anon…! Because of me, you…!” She bawls more and embraces me
>I don’t say anything and just let her cry
>”Hey, you okay?” I ask her after noticing she stopped crying and is just holding onto me
>”Doesn’t this kind of count as cheating since I’m hugging you while you’re with someone else?” She quietly asks and lets go
>”Is hugging a thing that counts as cheating though?”
>”Well...Depends on the person, I guess.” She awkwardly turns away from me
>”I don't think Faye is so shallow as to think a small hug counts as cheating. Now...should we go our separate ways now? Since it’s getting a bit late.” I look at the clock on my phone
>”Yeah we prob...What.”
>”Hmm? Oh, right.” I forgot for a moment that Faye’s ass is still my wallpaper
>”This...is a picture of Faye’s ass. And Faye is that someone I’m going out with.”
>”Anon, seems even your tastes have changed. I don’t remember you being an ass man before.”
>”An ass man? Well I think I’m more of a thigh man myself.”
>”Heh, thighs? hehehehehe...” She starts giggling like mad and covers her mouth with her paw
>”Is everything okay?”
>”I just remembered that one time one of my friends actually squashed a watermelon between her thighs!” Her giggling turns more mad
>'Wonder if Faye could do the same?' I then notice a message from said cat pop-up
>It reads: “Anon, where are youuuuuuu? I’m at your house rn.”
>Respond with: “I’m currently in the town close-by, there’s a spare key you can use to get in. It’s under the garage’s table, you should find it fairly quickly.”
>The fox next to me calms down a little from her giggle fit
>A another message pops up on the screen: “Found the key, it worked. Masturbating on your couch rn.”
>”TMI.”
>I get up and put my phone back
>”I’m gonna go now, since Faye is waiting for me at my house.” I prep my bike and hop on it
>”Oh, you’re leaving? See you Anon.” The fox waves to me and I wave back
>”You too.”
>Start riding back
>...
>Set my bike back and enter the house
>Flick off my shoes and go upstairs
>Faye seems to be already on my couch, judging by the sounds and low moans
>'Here we go.'
>I creep over cautiously, peeking at her over the couch to make sure that she's not loudly enjoying a cup of pudding
>Faye, of course, has one hand toying with her small breast as the other searches her insides gently and slowly
>So, she didn’t find the secret stash of pudding the fridge
>A moan escapes her lips as her head rolls back, her fur standing on edge as she notices I'm peeking at her
>I don't need to be given a second hint, and quickly join her on the couch in the nude
>I expect a generous repeat of the last time, but the second I'm beside her on the couch her claws are digging softly into my skin and she's holding me down
>She purrs loudly, rubbing her wet crotch against my leg as she speaks "I was hoping I could catch my prey watching me tonight~"
>This is a bit out of character for how she normally acts in bed, but the last time was her first time with me so that may be why
>As she teases my unprotected head for just a moment with her tongue as she opens up a condom, I have a more pressing thought in mind
>Could she be in heat?
>Would that be rude to ask?
>Maybe all of her playfulness was finally out in the open now that she was even closer to me
>My mind goes blank as I feel her rubbing herself to teasingly drip a steady stream of slick wetness onto me, teasing herself as much as she was me
>The saucy cat suddenly envelops me and growls playfully, leaning into me as she begins to go at me before I can say a word
>She pulls me into a deep passionate kiss, and I can't help but feel obligated to grip her hips and add a bit more force to her unusually rough thrusts on top of me
>When I finally break she's nibbling on my ear, her fuzzy body giving me just enough of a peek at her lower half to see exactly what she's doing
>She's crouched over me, legs to either side of my waist and barely on the couch as she holds onto my shoulders
>Faye's gorgeous pools of emerald stare directly into my own rich honey eyes as I slowly look up to her, leaning in for a kiss and robbing just a tiny bit of her dominating control from her grasp
>As we lock lips I try to remember this position for later, somewhat certain it's either the "rider" or the "shuttle"
>Whatever it is though, Faye is absolutely making it amazing, and her powerful deep thrusts send a reverberating purr into my chest that just makes me feel like I'm on fire
>She does her best to ride me like that for a while, happily enjoying her so called "prey"
>When I accidentally slip out of her during the rhythmic humping, she does her best to adjust her footing, Faye nearly slipping off the couch as I hold onto her and keep her from eating carpet 
>She laughs, climbing and sitting on my legs as she strokes me so as not to lose time "catching up" again
>"Alright, maybe we should be a bit more energetic, but I'll let you have control of how and where." 
>I gently move Faye around on the couch until she's fully under me and slowly move her legs under me to my shoulders
>When they're firmly over my chest and on my shoulders I'm surprised by just how much easier it is, her natural lower body strength supporting her fair share of the load
>I carefully enter her, but with a whining moan I can tell she wants a bit more speed this time
>I thrust against her body a bit faster, noting that she's helping a bit without realizing it as I speed up
>Every minute or so I add a few more thrusts worth or speed until I realize we're going at it a good deal faster than usual
>Her legs act as a springboard as I even out the speed, pushing me back every thrust and giving me energy to feed into the next one
>Unlike the last time, our shared orgasm explodes out of nowhere, and I tense up as her legs push and pull me to continue a few more thrusts
>I build up a solid rhythm, and really lay into her as she moans and purrs loud enough I'm certain the neighbors have to hear at least one of them
>Finally pulling free of her, the condom somehow holds together from the unusually powerful finish I threw at it
>The wet plop as it gently leaves her makes her shudder with excitement, and she seems unable to move much besides breathing and rolling her head back in bliss 
>I get ready to pull back and sit down on the couch, wondering if my thrusts were a bit too hard
>As I pull off of her she gently pushes me into a sitting position on the couch, slowly reaching her fuzzy paw towards my hand to help her up too 
>Moments later I pull her up beside me on the couch, burying her head into my chest and enjoying as she purrs deeply
>We simply rest for a moment, enjoying a gentle moment or two of perfect stillness before I figure we should both head to bed
>”Phew, I’m beat.” I sigh and wipe my brow and try to get off the couch
>”Only one round? No way, dude.” She throws me on the couch and I flop on my back
>”I came prepared for at least four more rounds~” She pulls out multiple condoms that I don’t know where she hid
>'I'm done for…’
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 7

>My body can’t move, even if I wanted it to
>Muscles aching like hell and a certain cat’s arms locking me in place
>’Am I in heaven or hell?’ I stare at the wooden ceiling
>Feel the grip around my ribs tighten and I realize how strong Faye actually is
>”Augh…”I try to exhale as quietly as I can, trying to not wake her up
>Her furred face presses against my arm and I feel her fur tickle me
>Smile and then just close my eyes, letting myself be absorbed into the warmth as we lay there for some time before Faye lets her death grip go
>”Mooorning~” She sleepily purrs and raises herself on the bed
>Her legs are holding my left one in place and she presses her chest to mine, giving even more warmth than before
>This feeling, combined with her curled fur brushing against my skin, has made me come to the conclusion that this is heaven
>”Morning, Faye.” I move my aching arm and pet her cheek
>She purrs softly and I continue rubbing her cheek
>”So, wanna get up right now or would you like to lay here with me?” I ask while almost taking comfort in my aching muscles
>”I’d like to get you up, if you get what I mean.” She swishes her tail flirty and I just smile, hoping my dick doesn't start making this morning hard for me
>”No thanks, I think yesterday was quite enough.”
>”Aw...I just wanted to suck you off.” She gets up from my bed and spreads her arms wide and her breasts bounce a little as she does a couple jumps
>”Maybe later… Can you help me up a little here?” I extend my arm to her as I try to get up
>She pulls me up and I rub my shoulders a little
>”Wow, we really did some fucking yesterday, didn’t we?” She whistle and latches herself onto my right arm
>”That we did. I’m gonna go take a shower.” I walk downstairs and Faye stays upstairs to make food
>Enter the shower and turn it on
>The water starts to fall on me and I wash myself as I sing just because
>”Don’t come to me, just ‘cause you’re lonely tonight~”
>”Lonely’s only a part of your game”
>”Long as you live, you must remember one thing…”
>”Give and take are one and the same~” suddenly, Faye’s voice sings and I feel her arms slide around my chest and her breasts pressing onto my back
>”Weren’t you gonna cook?” I ask her with a small laugh emitting from me
>”I thought we’d save time by taking a shower at the same time.” She gets some soap and scrubs my back
>I close my eyes and let her do her thing
>Her soft paws roll over my back gently and she continues singing
>”So tell me are you ready, really, really ready…” Her fingers seem to feel every inch of my back and I turn the water heat up a little
>”I don’t want your love for one night~" I sing next and I feel like my back is pretty clean
>Turn around and look her in her green eyes
>”’Cause I’m not looking for a love affair…” She smiles and I take her in a slow embrace as the warm water drips on us
>”I need the magic when I hold you near…” She whispers and then pushes against me, like she’s trying to come one with me
>”Hey, I got one thing I wanna tell you.” I say to her and swipe some of my bangs off my face
>Her wet face looks sincerely at me and her eyes look as if they know what I’m about to say
>I arch my back forwards a little and swallow all these unsure feelings
>”I...love you.” I say and kiss her wetted lips
>”I already knew that.... I love you too, you hopeless romantic.”
>”Hopeless romantic?”
>”You were hoping for a scene of us being sitting near a fireplace and huddling close to each other for warmth while we confess our love, weren’t you?” She giggles and starts to wash her own fur
>”Well something like that. Want me to help you?”
>”Thanks, can you wash me?”
>”not only your back? Okay then.” I start by washing her head
>...
>We ended spending more time in the shower than expected
>’Yep. Eating breakfast with someone else is so much better than eating alone.’ I take a bite out of my sandwich and I glance at the trees outside again, but then I turn my eyes to Faye
>”Whatchu wanna do today?” Faye drinks some water and then takes a small bite out of my sandwich, even though she still hasn’t fully eaten her own
>”Maybe I’ll just paint and topcoat my kits today.”
>”Kits?”
>”I MEAN my model-kits.” I quickly fix the sentence and then I finish my sandwich
>”Oh, model-kits.” She chuckles
>”I thought you had kids or something like that.” She jokes and finishes eating as well
>”Of course I don’t. Do I look like a father?”
>”Well, not yet.”
>”Yet?”
>She smirks and something clicks in my head
>”Oh, you mean like us having a kid or something?”
>”Don’t say it so casually!” Her curly fur gains a bit of fluff to it and she lightly jabs my side
>”Sorry sorry. By the way, how did you get here?”
>”I used a bus.”
>”Huh. Why’d you come here anyway? Just for a quick fuck or something else?”
>”It got pretty boring after you left, so I just came here.”
>”Why don’t you just move in here? I got two unused bedrooms in this house anyways.”
>”We’ve started dating for only a few days and we’re already at the moving-in-with-each-other phase?”
>”Just a thought.” I shrug and throw myself down on the living room couch
>’Where in the hell’s bells is my phone?’ I pat my cargo pants
>”Lost something?” The cat asks and I turn my head to the right and see her short body covered by one of my button-ups
>”Nothing, just forgot that I placed my phone to charge yesterday.”
>I get up and go get my phone
>There’s a few good messages on it asking me, very rudely, about where I am
>”I didn’t they cared that much about me.”
>Reply with a “at my home.”
>Go back to the living room with phone in hand
>Faye is lying on the couch again, but isn’t doing anything lewd right now
>She’s just rolling from side to side and purring
>Snap a quick picture and notice I managed to get a small panty shot, but without the panties
>’Should I start making a fap folder of her?’
>”Taking pics again? I’m flattered~” She sits up and gets her legs inside the button-up and then leans back on the couch
>”You can take pics of me if you want.”
>”Already have, no need to worry.” She flips out her phone and shows about fifty pictures of me laying on my bed, naked and a good third of the pics are of me with a massive hard-on
>”Oh, okay…” I feel a bit creeped out, but mostly prideful
>”So, when are you gonna go do stuff to your model-kits?”
>”Maybe later, for some reason I’ve just been feeling really sleepy all morning.” I yawn and sit down next to her
>She pushes my head down onto her lap and I feel how strong her thighs feel like
>”Now, sleep quietly within my thighs!” She hams and I roll myself to face her
>”Trying to pull some Victory lines? Brings into mind, wanna watch a show called King Gainer?”
>”You got the series?”
>”Yep” I get myself up and urge her to follow me into my room
>”It’s on my pc, all 26 episodes.”
>”Cool.” She flops down on my bed and wraps the sheets around her
>I turn on my pc and prepare everything for watching time
>She offers me room under the sheets and I swoop in next to her, but she then sits herself down on my lap
>Faye then starts to wiggle her ass on my crotch and you can all guess what that makes my dick feel
>”F-Faye...This early in the morning?" I feel a bit of discomfort from my pants getting tighter by the second and her grinding only excited me further
>”Hmm?” She notes her phone and stand up, leaving me sitting there with a boner I didn’t really ask for
>Her phone plays Yes Girl and she swipes on the screen and puts the phone up to her ear
>”What’s up?”
>’Someone calling this early in the morning?’ I stare at the bare ass that was resting on me just moments ago and I take another picture
>The cat just stands there, talking humbly to someone
>A couple minutes later, she closes the call
>”Who was that?” I ask, boner now killed and me left internally disappointed
>”Just my mother, she always seems to check up on me for if I’ve already given her grandkids.” She shrugs and almost slams herself onto my lap
>The dream is not dead and neither is my dick
>”Now...back to this~” She grinds in a circular pattern and I throb a little
>”So we gonna watch the show or not?” She grins with a flash of her teeth
>”Y-Yeah. Let’s…”
>...
>Suffering. That’s how I’d describe the next few hours
>Faye constantly grinding against me with her furry ass and every time I was about to blow, she went to get something to drink or eat
>Absolute suffering
>She’s still grinding and purring as well
>Here comes that feeling again, and Faye got up
>Grab her by the wrist and pull her down onto the bed and get on top of her
>”I’m not letting go of you this time.” I say to her and hold her paws in place with my hands
>She just smiles wryly and purrs louder
>”We don’t have anymore condoms, do we? So do I have to use my mouth?” She shows her tongue and wiggles it
>”Yep.” Get off her and sit back down on the bed, leaning myself onto the wall and legs hanging off the edge of the bed
>She almost jumps between my legs and pulls my pants and boxers off in quick fashion
>Drops them to the floor and she stares happily at my member
>The doorbell rings
>’I’m...not even mad, just disappointed.’
>Get my pants back on and go downstairs after asking Faye to stay in my room
>See a very familiar figure at the door and I slowly open it
>”Hi again.” The arctic fox waves to me shyly
>Sigh and run my hand through my hair
>”Lemme guess, you missed your bus or something and you want me to give you a ride home?”
>”Well...Yes.” She looks like she’s a child getting caught trying to steal some cookies
>”Won’t there be more busses coming through the route you’re taking?” I place my hands on my hips and I sigh again
>”No comment…” She looks away
>”Alright, but first…” I turn around and see Faye standing curiously in front of me
>”Here’s Faye.” I present the cat
>”Oh, you mean she’s the one whose rear is on your phone?”
>”Yes.” I answer and Faye hugs my arm and pulls on it
>”He’s mine, just letting you know.”
>”I know, I know. I’m just asking Anon here for a ride.”
>Faye’s expression turns cold
>”What.”
>”A ride home!” The arctic fox fixes her fumble
>”Oh, good. Because I’m the only one that gets to ride him.” The cat grips my arm tighter
>”Okay then. So Anon, could you give me a ride home?”
>”Yeah, fine but Faye, if you’re coming along with us then you’ll have to dress more properly.”
>”Fine fine.” The cat skips upstairs and comes down a few moments later
>She seems to have taken her jeans and shoes, but still wearing my button-up with the hem of it under the jeans
>”I’m gonna go get the car, so you ladies wait here.”
>I go to the garage and drive the car out onto the front of the house
>The two anthros enter the car, Faye in the passenger seat next to me and the arctic fox in the backseat
>I ask the fox for directions and she gives me the address and I punch the info into the GPS
>Start driving and put the radio on
>Last Christmas is playing right now
>I laugh out loud and Faye looks at me weirdly
>”What’s so funny?”
>”The fact that this song’s playing right now. Isn’t that right Roux?”
>”Yeah. Some these lyrics really fit this situation, don’t they?” She glumly says
>”Wait...You’re his ex!?” Faye yells and turns to the arctic fox
>”That’s me.”
>Faye doesn’t say anything
>”...Why’d you two break?”
>I freeze up a little, but I snap back and continue driving like normal, but with a heavy coldness
>”I...cheated on him.”
>Faye gasps and looks at me
>”Really...? You make me sick…” Her tone of voice even suggests the same
>”I’m not that surprised that it would. I felt like shit too after doing it.”
>”But, why did you do it?” Faye doesn’t turn to the fox and just stares at her own legs
>”I don’t really know, probably an act of stupid horniness on my part.” Roux sighs and I feel something, but not sure what
>”I just don’t get why someone would cheat on someone else. It just makes me feel disgusting.”
>”I think the fact I...saw the cheating happening makes it even worse.”
>”...What?” The cat’s voice shakes a little
>I smile weakly and remember that night of a full moon
>”Oh my god…How can you breathe the same air as her?” Faye asks and I drive the car under a bridge and see the small city where Roux said she lived
>”I don’t know. Maybe I still hold some semblance of feelings of compassion towards her?”
>”Anon…” The fox whispers and I turn a corner
>”We’re here.” I turn off the radio
>”Oh...Thank you.” Roux gets off the car and walks into the apartment building
>I drive back home
>”Anon…” Faye places her hand kindly on my thigh and I momentarily gaze at her before continuing to drive
>”Yeah?”
>”I just...I’m gonna promise on my life that I’ll never cheat on you or anything like that.”
>”Thanks. I promise the same.”
>She gives a small kiss to my cheek and I get out my phone and play Magic by Jacob Wheeler
>The rest of the ride goes by with us singing along to the lyrics
>...
>I don’t really know if I relieved or not, but I can’t bother caring about that now
>”Wanna continue watching King Gainer?” I ask her and she walks up next to me and gives another smooch
>”Okay.” A smile I will protect appears and we go back into my room to continue our watching
>...
>As the day goes by, Faye leaves for her home and I wave goodbye from the front door
>”Now I feel really lonely. She’s addicting.” I laugh to myself and go to the workshop
>’I’ll go crank my frustrations later, now I’ve got gunpla to paint.’
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 8

>Morning comes with it’s feelings of comfortableness
>Open my eyes, get up and stretch
>Slam the door of my room open and listen to the sounds of silence
>Use my phone to play flyaway by BACK-ON
>Sing and dance along to the song as I make breakfast
>’What should I do today? Fuck around?’
>Two months have flown by since I’ve started dating Faye and I’m happier than I thought I could be
>Take my breakfast (two simple sandwiches like always) and go to my room
>Turn on the pc and watch some Turn A Gundam while I eat
>...
>’Hmm? A call?’ I take off my headphones and look at my phone, Faye’s calling
>”Yo, what’s up?”
>”Hi Anon...I just uh…”
>”Did something happen or…?”
>”I just uh, got in a small accident.”
>”What?” My body and voice tense up as I turn off the pc and walk out of my room
>”I... twisted my ankle a bit during Judo practice yesterday and I had to get a brace on it.”
>”Why didn’t you tell me immediately!?” I yell as I put on my jeans and jacket
>”You don’t have to yell! I just didn’t want to burden you, because you’d probably just come running here right after I told you.”
>”...” I put on my shoes and almost slam the front door behind me as I run to the garage
>”Wait, are you actually coming here?”
>”I’m worried and wanna check on you, is that so bad?” My face heats up a little and I enter the garage and open the door
>”No, it just proves you really are a great boyfriend.” Even though I can’t see her, I can still feel her smiling
>”You’re a lovely girlfriend too.” I drive the car out and then close the garage door with the remote
>”Lovely? I don’t know about that…”
>”You are lovely! Your voice, personality, cute fur, those strong and beautiful legs and those tender arms of yours… All that and more, are what make you lovely!” I yell passionately
>She just laughs
>”Y-You don’t have to laugh…” I rest my head on the wheel and sigh
>”Sorry, I just didn’t expect you to say something like that.”
>”Is it so out of character for me?”
>”Yep. By the way, are you driving right now?”
>”No, why?”
>”Good, because I’m now gonna close this call so that you can haul your cute ass over here. See you soon.”
>”You too.” I say and she closes the call
>Start driving, but try to not go over the speed limit as I drive
>...
>Park in the driveway of her house and then take out the keys she gave to me
>Enter the house, throw off my shoes and barge into her room
>”AH! Jesus, Anon! Could you enter any louder?” The grey cat on the bed yells and places her paw on her pajama-covered chest
>”Oh sorry.” I laugh and then walk sit down next to her
>”So, how bad is it?” I roll the pajamas up a bit so that I can see the brace
>”Not really bad, just have to keep it for two weeks and then I’ll be good as new!” She gives a lively grin
>I move my leg and notice two walking sticks on the floor
>”Want me to get you something?”
>”A Dr.Pepper. It’s in the fridge.”
>”Alrighty, wait here and I’ll bring you your beverage soon.” I bow myself out of the room and hear her chuckle
>Go into the kitchen and open the fridge
>There’s a bit more food than the last time I visited
>Grab two bottles off Dr.Pepper
>’Why’s it called “Dr.Pepper” anyway?’
>Go back into her room and lay down on the bed next to her
>”Here.” I hand her the bottle and she pulls herself up to a sitting position
>”Thanks, love.”
>’Petnames? Hmm....’
>No problem, baby.” I smile and open my bottle
>She pfts and I look at her
>”Baby? That’s cute, dear.”
>”Oh shut it.” I pull her close
>She picks up a remote and turns on a tv lying on a stand
>”Let’s watch some stuff for now, dear~” She purrs that last part out
>Stroke her curly fur and drink a bit of my Dr.Pepper
>’I think I’m starting to like this soda more.’
>We just watch some cooking shows and a couple reality-tv shows, but we didn’t seem to concentrate on that rather we focus on cuddling
>”Hey Anon, are you happy with me?”
>”Where’s this coming from?” I sip the last of my drink and then put the bottle down on the floor
>”I just wondered, am I really that lovely?”
>”Yeah you are.” I place my face on her head and feel how curly her fur is
>”Really?”
>”Really, now where’s that cheeky smile?” I use my index fingers to pull a smile on her face and she tries biting my left finger
>”If my legs were working now, I’d kick your ass.”
>”I’d love to get my ass kicked by you.”
>She smirks and jabs me with a bit more force this time
>I clench my teeth a little at the sudden pain
>”Sorry…”Her ears flop down and she looks shyly at me
>”No problem. You smiled though.” I get back closer to her and continue petting her
>She plants her face against my side and purrs cutely
>...
>After a few hours pass, doorbell rings
>”I’ll go get it.” I say and go out of the room and to the front door
>Open it and see a unknown long-haired vixen stand there, dressed in shorts and a tank-top
>And a red-and-white cap to go along with the outfit
>”Excuse me, but this is where Faye lives, right?” She asks while putting her paws on her hips
>”Yes, she’s in her room right now and can’t move due her ankle being braced.”
>”Yeah, I know. I’m in the same Judo practice group as her and I just came to check on her. Are you her boyfriend or something?”
>I nod my head and signal her to come in
>”Hey Faye, there’s someone here from your Judo group.” I point to the vixen as we enter the room
>”Oh hi Vivi.” Faye waves to the vixen and she walk next to the cat
>”Is this guy really your boyfriend?” She asks and points to me
>”Yeah, why?” The cat asks innocently and I sit down next to her again
>”I always thought you couldn’t get a boyfriend even if your life depended on it.” Vivi scoffs
>”But here I am, with a human boyfriend. And if I remember correctly, you don’t have a boyfriend~” She giggles and comes under my arm and rests her head on my side
>”That’s none of your goddamn business.” The vixen crosses her arms and snaps her head to the left
>”Maybe, but I feel so sorry for you because you don’t have someone to cuddle up next to when you go sleep…” Faye hugs my side and pushes her face again against me
>”S-Shut up!” The vixen’s fur puffs and she pouts
>”Faye, you shouldn’t tease your friend so much.” I pat the cat and she looks up to me
>”Just let me have this.” She whispers to me and moves her head side-to-side
>”You two are doing this to spite me, aren’t you?”
>”No, she’s just getting a bit carried away…” I try to defuse the situation and I then hear the front door open
>”I’m leaving.” The vixen starts to walk out and when she exits the room, she bounces back
>”Oh, sorry about that. Didn’t see you there.” The voice of Aki says and I turn myself on the bed to see what’s happening
>”A-Aki? When did you get here?” Vivi stutters out and brings herself up quickly
>”I just came home from some work, I was covering for someone.”
>”Oh, is that so? Uh...Excuse me.” The vixen awkwardly goes past the male cat and exits the house
>”...What was that about?” He turns to us and we look at each other while smiling ear-to-ear
>Aki just looks at us, confused and then looks to the door again
>”Eh, whatever.” He walks off after picking up his bag
>”She has a crush on him.” She whispers to me as we go back to sitting closely on the bed
>”Seems like it.” I whisper back and we continue watching some shows
>...
>”I wanna go outside with you, but it’s such a hassle to walk with sticks…” Faye whines as she looks out the window while rubbing her cheek against my face
>”And it’s raining too…” She adds and rubs harder
>”Yep. Isn’t it a bit cold in here?” I look at the small space heater under the window and note it’s low settings
>”A bit, but you keep me warm just fine.” She kisses my cheek and we lean on each other
>”Same goes to you.” I hold her close with my right arm and breathe onto her fur
>Take my phone out and play White Day In The Blue
>Her purring cutely sounds and I proceed to hold her close with both arms
>Slowly lay down completely on the bed together
>”Wanna just lay here and warm each other up?” I kiss her again
>”Okay~”
>”Heh, remember that time you said about me being a hopeless romantic who wanted to confess his love while sitting by a fireplace? This sorta reminds me of that.” I chuckle and stroke her fur
>”Mmm. Wanna do it now? Just because?” She turns her face up to mine
>”Uh, okay.”
>”I’m in love with you, you hopeless romantic.” She kisses me and it feels a bit more special than the other times till now
>”...I love you too, my little ball of cuteness.” I say the first thing that comes to my mind and kiss her back
>’That line was probably cheesy as all hell, but what-the-fuck-ever.’
>She start using her tongue and I didn’t mind the coarseness of it the first time and neither will I now
>I feel her tongue with mine as our bodies squish against each other
>Somehow we soon find ourselves sleeping in each other’s arms
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 9

>The tomorrow day brings it’s new, interesting things
>Such as the fact I’m currently carrying Faye on my back as we walk from our car to a wooden house on a hill
>I walk up to the door and the cat’s helping paw presses the doorbell
>Two seconds pass with her cutely nuzzling her cheek against my neck
>Our moment is broken as the door slams open and a old-looking female cat stands there, sporting the same grey curls as Faye
>Her face is simple happiness
>”Hi, mother.”
>”Oh my. My cute daughter is getting carried by her lover? That is so cute! Just stay there for a moment.” She runs off to, by my guess, fetch a camera to take a picture of us
>I enter the house and take off my shoes, Faye isn’t wearing anything on her feet, but only her socks, because she didn’t want to
>”Take me to the living room, on the right.” She points to the doorway on the right and I go past it
>See a couch and lower her onto it
>”Thanks.” She purrs and I sit down next to her
>Pat her and look down at her body
>Her simple black tank-top loosely rests on her body and so do her jeans
>She suddenly pulls a quick peck on my lips and I return one back
>The click of a camera sounds and we snap our heads to that direction
>”I just thought you two looked so cute~ Reminds me of me and my husband back in the day.” The busty old cat squeals
>”Honey-buns, what’s going...on?” A yawning man of height appears
>”Oh hi, father.” Faye waves to him
>’So her dad’s a human? huh.’
>”Who’s this little guy?” He yawns while staring at me
>”Uh, I’m Anon. Faye’s boyfriend.” I feel a bit of mental pressure from him and rub the back of my neck a little
>”Oh.” He turns his eyes to Faye’s leg
>”What happened with your leg?” His fatherly worry comes out
>”I just had twisted my ankle a bit in Judo practice, that’s all.” She casually laughs
>”Get better, dear. I’m going to make us all some coffee, everyone fine with that?” The mother asks and the three of us nod
>She leaves with a wave
>”I couldn’t ask for a more perfect wife.”
>”She does seem nice, but not as nice as your daughter.” I retort and kiss Faye
>”Hey now, sure you wanna be getting all close with my daughter while I’m here?” He snorts and leanly sits down on a cushioned chair
>”Yes, I’m sure I want to.” I take the grey cat in a hug
>”Anon please, not in front of father....” She tries to get free and I let her go
>”Oh, sorry.” I kinda feel sad about her not wanting to hug, but I’ll get many chances to hug her later
>Her dad chuckles loudly
>”No need to act so shy when I’m around. By the way, do you two live together yet?”
>”Not yet, we still live separately.” I answer instinctively
>”Want me to get you two a place here?”
>”No thanks, I’d rather move to Anon’s.” Faye straightens herself and leans timidly on me
>”You got a good house?” The dad leans forward and crosses his hands
>”A house with three bedrooms and I’ve even got a furnace for heating and four solar panels as well.” I stroke Faye’s fur as we talk
>”You...live alone?” His rough eyes squint a little
>Nod in response
>”Hmm, what about your economic state?”
>”Stable job at a local restaurant, mostly being a cashier or cleaning up.”
>”Huh, you never told me.” Faye lays on the couch and places her head on my lap
>”Well, it never came into discussion.”
>”Coffee’s here! And you two are definitely so cute together!” The happy old cat comes in while carrying a platter with four cups of coffee
>I giggle and feel my face heat up a little
>”Yeah.” Faye raises herself and hugs me, like she’s trying to hide her face
>’She’s embarrassed? That is adorable.’
>Her mom giggles softly as she sets the platter down on a wooden table
>”Aaah, coffee. The thing that keeps me awake for an entire day.” The man gets a cup and light sniffs the aroma
>”This brings back memories, doesn’t it?” He turns to his wife and they smile to each other
>”Yes, it does.” She takes a cup and goes to the rocking chair near the window
>...
>We chat while sipping on the coffee and listening to a smooth piano being played on a cassette player
>”So, when did you two meet?” I inquire after learning about the couple’s decade long marriage
>”Well...it was a friday afternoon, 16-year old me had just finished his classes for the day and I had exited the school building and went to the town to go to the movies with a group of friends.”
>He takes a small sip and stares at the cup
>”...But I then found out they had already left. One of them brought a girlfriend along and I think I broke a bit during that day. I walked home with a droop and bumped into someone just before turning a corner to the street where my house was.”
>”And then we met, somehow just..connected.” He turns to his wife and they have that little “forever together”-type of stare for a while
>”We started as just friends, but went to lovers in the years we knew each other.” She sighs and rocks the chair gently
>”I wouldn’t have thought then that we would end up like this, telling a story of our first meeting to our daughter and her dearest.” Her soothing tone makes me smile as I gulp some of my coffee
>”Neither would have I. But, I’m glad we walked down this path together. I love you, my dear Tarja.” He gets up and goes to hug his wife, pulling her into a gentle embrace
>”I love you, my wonderful Ernesti.” She stands up and hugs him back deeply
>I feel Faye rest her head on my shoulder and she seems to ponder something as she looks at the mostly-empty cup
>”...Wonder if we’ll get to be mushy like that someday?” She whispers and I glance at her, stroke her fur and glance back at the embracing couple
>”Yeah, we will.” I give a small kiss to her frowning lips and when I pull back, they’re upside down
>The silence that blankets the room, it’s warmth can’t be explained by words alone
>”Mind if we made our leave now?” I ask after I see Faye drinking the last of her coffee
>”Oh that’s fine, you two have a good trip home.” Tarja waves us off and takes the empty cups away on the platter
>”See you two when you get kids!” Ernesti yells as I leave the house with Faye on my back
>”Roger that, sir!” I yell back and close the door
>”Anon! Though, I wouldn’t mind having some…”  The cat on my back quietly says and I pick up the pace
>”Now or later?”
>”Hmm...Later, let’s just go eat dinner now.” I help her down on the passenger seat and go the driver seat myself
>”Alright, let’s go home.”
>Rest of the day goes swimmingly, i’d say
>And so the adventure of life goes on

>Part 10

>A good year passes by and we end up finding ourselves in the same warm bedroom
>”Morning, love.” Faye's lovely voice is the first thing in the morning I hear and we get off the double bed
>”Morning...” A yawn escapes my mouth and I turn my vision to the backyard for a moment
>’Apple trees growing fine, should probably clean the leaves off the ground though.’
>Stumble sleepily out of the bedroom and see Faye in kitchen, making what appears to be breakfast
>”I wuv you.” I hug her from behind and she just giggles
>”Same to you.” She continues making breakfast while I just coddle her
>A small purr comes from her and I feel up her curls with my cheek
>”...Sorry, but could you get off? Maybe take a shower?”
>”But it’s the weekend...And we can just be around the house.” I whine and hug her a bit tighter
>”You can still take a shower while I make this.”
>”Do I smell that bad?” I let go and sniff myself a little, not being able to really distinguish any real bad smell
>”No, I just wanted to get some freedom of movement.”
>”Evil witch.” I click my tongue a bit
>”It’s not halloween yet.”
>”I’m gonna take that shower.” I walk downstairs after getting some clothes to wear
>...
>Emerge back upstairs in cotton socks, leggings and a t-shirt
>”Breakfast is ready!” The cat calls to me and I slide on over to the set table
>Sit down and start eating, with her sitting next to me
>”So, how’s it going?” She asks while fiddling with my long, untied and clean hair
>”Huh?”
>”Can’t I just ask my boyfriend about how he’s doing?”
>”I’m doing pretty fine, what about you?”
>”Quite perfect, if I’m gonna be honest.”
>”Heh.” I pet her cheek a bit and notice her still wearing the same-old pajamas as always
>’I should buy her some new ones. Maybe a dress also. Wait, a wedding dress.’ I smile like an idiot at the thought
>”What are you grinning there about?”
>”Oh nothing, just thinking about how you’d look in a wedding dress.” I caress her cheek more
>”Hmm, how WOULD I look in one? Really short?”
>”But you are short and cuddly.” I give her a couple pats on the head and a kiss to along with it
>”And you’re tall.”
>’Technically I’m not, you’re just short.’
>”Anyway, wanna just play games for now?” I get up and place my bowl in the sink and scoot on over to the living room
>”Fine by me, best of 3?” She follows me and we sit down on the couch
>”Yep.” I get the controllers for us
>...
>”Well, that was absolute bullshit.” She puts the controller down and crosses her arms
>”Nope, absolutely fair.” My gaming pride has jumped to high-heavens as I reach around to hug the cat
>”I was gonna say that I’m upset as hell, but now I’d be lying.” She embraces me also
>Her curly, but soft fur never ceases to feel nice upon my skin
>We cuddle there for little and she suddenly sneezes
>”Feeling cold?” I hug her to give her a bit warmth
>”A bit.” She giggles and I breathe on her neck
>”I’m gonna go put some wood in the furnace.” I stand up and leave the room
>Put on sweatpants and a hoodie and see Faye getting some jeans and one of button-ups again
>”Why don’t you buy yourself a shirt instead of constantly wearing mine?”
>”It saves money and I get to wear your clothes, win win.”
>We go into the garage and go into the small room that contains the furnace
>Pack a good amount of wood in the furnace and light the wood
>Close the cover and turn on the internal fan with the help of the electric control pad on top of the furnace
>”Alright, rock-paper-scissors on who has to come check if the wood is still burning.” I raise my fist, ready for battle
>She raises her curled-up paw
>”Rock”
>”Paper”
>”Scissors!”
>”...”
>Click my tongue and snap my fingers
>”Damn.”
>”I win and you get to give me a complimentary kiss.” She turns her smug cheek to me
>Smooch her and then duck
>Lock my arms around her waist and lift her up
>”Aeh! The fuck are you doing?”
>”Just carrying you.” I exit the furnace room and slam the door closed with my leg
>Slowly lean forward a little and switch to carrying her like she’s my bride
>”I think I just had a couple heart-attacks right there. Don’t do that so suddenly.” the expected elbow jab comes to my chest
>”Sorry sorry. I just wanted to feel your touch more.”
>I walk out of the garage and back into the house proper
>Let Faye down and take off my shoes
>She takes hers off and places them neatly next to mine
>Take off the outdoor wear after we get upstairs
>Faye gives a small kiss to me as I hang the jacket on the coat rack
>Walk back to the living room couch and sit down on it
>”...Hey. Want me to buy a gunpla for you? Didn’t you once mention that you were interested in it?” I pet her as she leans herself upon me
>”Uh, okay. What would you suggest?” She kisses my neck
>”Maybe the G-Arcane? Hold on let me get my phone...” Stand up and leave for my room
>Grab the charged phone and walk on over back to the couch
>Go to amazon.uk and get to the page for the HGRC G-Arcane
>”..This.” I show her what’s on the screen and she takes the phone in her paws
>”Isn’t this also from G-reco?” Her eyes turn to me and I momentarily lose myself in them
>”Yeah, it is.” I answer and she just drops her head onto my lap
>”Hmmm, I’ll take it.” She passes the phone to me and I look around the site for a gunpla to buy for myself
>’Maybe I’ll get the Age-1 Full Granza.’
>Order the two model-kits and put my phone away, but I get interrupted by a buzzing on it
>’Hmm?’
>Bring it back up and look at the screen
>Dad’s number is calling
>”Hello, dad?” I place the phone near my ear and stand up from the couch
>”...Hello, Anon.” My dad’s voice speaks past the phone’s speakers
>”Oh, hi dad. What are you calling me about?” I walk to the window and lean on it
>”It’s about your sister.” His tone turns cold as he speaks
>”What a-about her?” Insecurity starts to rise within me as I grip the phone a bit harder
>”Your sister...passed away earlier today, she was in a car accident and lost her life in it... Oh god, why...” He quivers and the call cuts off, leaving only a few beeps
>”Dad? Dad!?” I try to contact him again and in my panic, I drop the phone on the floor but the screen doesn’t seem to crack or anything
>”What’s wrong?” Faye picks it up and I grab it hastily out of her paws
>”Ow, what the hell?” Her voice is none of my concern right now
>’Come on, come on, come on, come on...ANSWER ALREADY!’ No answer comes as the attempted call ends
>My body is absolutely frozen and my mind is about ready to collapse under stress
>The same number is calling again
>Stand up and answer with quivering hands
>”He..Hello? Dad?” My voice almost chokes
>”It’s your mother here...Your father is too upset to answer right now.” Her own sadness is clear with that despair-riddled tone of hers
>”She...can’t be dead, can she? she isn’t, right?”
>”We were at the hospital to confirm it. We’ll...hold the funeral next saturday.”
>”O-Oh, okay.” I close the call and drop my phone onto the floor
>”What’s wrong?” Faye questions and I raise my teary face to her
>”My sister, s-she died. They’ll be having the funeral on Saturday...” I then cry and hug her, pushing us both onto the couch with me resting pretty much on top of her and with my face planted on her chest
>She holds my head, petting my hair and she sighs
>”I’m not sure if I can do much to help, but...You can cry on me.”
>And so, I cry without a sign of stopping
>Just whimpering and sniffles
>”...Tears of sadness and the tears of joy” Faye’s voice sings and I gasp a little
>”After crying, it is all the same…”
>”It’ll come down to the thought, these tears are from the heart. The goodness that we share from our heart…” She finishes singing and just strokes through my hair as I continue sobbing for what seems like hours
>...
>’Did...I fall asleep? I always seem to do that around her.’ I open my eyes and see the wooden living room ceiling
>Scroll my eyes to the left and see Faye sleeping next to me with her arms encompassing me
>”Thanks.” I can’t really pet her or anything because of her hug trapping my arms
>She doesn’t seem to be waking up soon
>’Yeah, my sister...she died.’ That depressive thought creeps into my mind and I feel just useless
>’Why did she have to go? She was just a happy-go-lucky person...She didn’t even have a child or a boyfriend. She died alone in a fucking car, without her family or anyone around her.’
>Thoughts race in my mind and then the slight movement of Faye’s arms snap me out of my mind’s space
>”Oh? You woke up already?” The loving grey cat tightens her grip for a moment and then purringly nuzzles to me
>I move to my side in order to hug her as well
>”Where would I be without you…” I whisper under my breath and just realize how much this cat actually means to me
>”Hey, you doing better?” She asks and stares at me with those green eyes of hers
>”A bit, but I still can’t believe that she’s…” I bite my bottom-lip and for some reason, I hold back the slight tears
>”...I’m not really sure what to do, but I’m here if you need me.” She gives a small smile and I do the same
>”Thanks. And sorry if I hurt you today.”
>”Huh?” She looks at me with a perplexed expression and that sort-of calms me
>”I mean when I dropped my phone and you picked it up and I just took it from your paws.” I feel like I’ve broken some unspoken promise with myself
>”Oh, that. It’s okay, you just scratched me a little with your nail.”
>”Sorry…” The depression starts to seep in more
>”Don’t worry about it, you big softie. Now, want me to make us something to eat?” She slide across me and slowly stands up as the afternoon atmosphere sets itself in our home
>”Yeah, thanks.” I sit and stare at the floor for a moment before standing up with relaxed stance
>’A big softie, huh. She really is the glue holding me together.’
>”I’ll help you with that. Since we both know who is the better cook in this household.”
>”Are you trying to imply something?” She snarks and gets the apron with a heart symbol on it
>”Just that you're the best cook here." I kiss her and then we start cooking
>And so the adventure of life...goes on

>Part 11 [contains lewd through lines 1973 - 2049]

>Saturday, a day most people would be enjoying their lives with
>Me? I’m mourning the loss of one with my mom and dad
>Our faces are weeping for her, my sister, their daughter
>”...Is she looking from the heavens now?” I ask, probably to the winter’s wind which will never return an answer
>I look up to the hazy sky as I open my car’s door, my years-old suit feeling a bit cold on my body
>”It’s snowing.” A small drop of snow lands on the ground and more start falling to the ground
>”Hey.” My dad calls and I turn to him, his face now calmer than when my sister was getting buried
>”I wanted to ask, how’s your dear Faye doing?” He continues, his slightly reddened eyes blink a couple time, probably tired from wholeheartedly crying
>”She’s doing fine, we’re living together now.”
>”Is that so? Well, that’s good. Now hurry on back to your girlfriend, wouldn’t want to keep her waiting.” He hollowly laughs
>”Maybe but, I’d...like to visit the grave once more.” I close the car door and start walking back into the cemetery
>I stop in front of the gravestone of Emma, my sister
>”Hey, sis.”
>”I don’t know if you can hear me, being dead and all, but…”
>”...Thanks for being a great big sister.”
>”I got a girlfriend, though you already knew that.”
>”She’s wonderful, a loving and supportive woman who I’d like to…I’m gonna keep that last part to myself for now.”
>”You used to tease me so much about getting a girlfriend, even though you didn’t have anyone to hold close yourself… Were you just trying to get me to be happy in life? Or something else?”
>”...Guess I’ll just have to make an answer to that myself and move on with that in my heart.”
>I chuckle a little and turn to walk away, feeling the cold breeze as the snow drifts down
>”Wonder if she remembered to put wood in the furnace? We did gather quite a lot of it for the winter.”
>I walk back to the car and see that my parents seem to have already left
>Open my car’s door and sit at the wheel
>Let out a loud sigh and undo my suit tie a bit
>”So, let’s go home now.” I start up the car and drive back home
>...
>Arrive at the house and the smokestack above the garage’s red roof dispenses smoke, meaning Faye remembered to light the furnace
>Drive the car into the garage and walk out into the yard
>Enter the house and take off my shoes and place them to the side
>Walk upstairs and smell something...spicy
>Look in the kitchen and the familiar shape of the grey cat is humming as she cooks
>”I’m home.” I say and she snaps her attention to me
>”Welcome back.” She smiles and I see that she’s wearing the heart-symboled apron I bought for her
>”What are you cooking?” I take off the jacket and dust off some snow off it before hanging it
>”Just some risotto. Your favourite, right?” She embraces me from behind and I can feel her warmth, even through the fabric of the shirt
>”Yeah, thanks.” I turn around and hug her back
>”You’re really cold. Want something warm to drink?”
>”Nah. I’ll just get my warmth from you.”
>She breathes to my neck and I giggle a bit
>”So, how did it go?” She breaks the hug and we stand in front of each other and I’m once more reminded of how cutely short she is
>”I’m not sure how to describe it...but I think it went okay.” I look outside at the falling snow for a bit before Faye’s warmly paws grab my attention
>”Hey, I want us to make a promise.” Her eyes look serious and I gulp a little
>”Yeah?”
>”Let’s promise to...live happy together, okay?” Her smile seems to melt something deep within me
>”...Yeah, I promise.” I take her in yet another hug and she slowly wraps her arms around me
>”I promise too. I don’t know if I have the right to say this, but you held your sister close to your heart, didn’t you?”
>”Yep, that I did and do even now.”
>”Then let’s live happy in her stead. She probably would want you to live happy as well.” She jumps up a little and gives me a kiss before going back to cooking
>That something that had melted, now changes its form to something warm
>”When did you become a philosopher?” I joke and walk next to her, touching her fur on her cheek with a light touch
>”I just said the first thing that came to mind. But seriously, let’s make sure to stay true to that promise.” She stirs the risotto a bit
>”I hear you. Thank you.” I sit down at the table and let out a small sigh
>”No problem.”
>My sight turns to the large spruce trees and I note how much snow has actually fallen
>”How much snow did they predict for today?” I look to Faye and my eyes follow her fluffy/curly-furred tail swishing a bit
>”It was...14 centimetres?”
>’Probably enough to build a snow fort.’ I look back outside and the snow blanketing the forest seems to be very thick
>”Good thing we packed all that wood then.”
>”And I remembered to light the furnace today!” She grins satisfied
>”Yeah, thanks for that. By the way, my dad asked how you were doing. I said you were doing fine.”
>”Weren’t your parents a bit wary of me when we visited them?”
>”Yeah, but at least dad seems to have grown more accepting of you. Not sure about mom though. And sis, well...she did like the idea of you being my girlfriend.” I sigh a little and touch the wooden table
>”...Sorry.” Her sad voice says and her tail stops it’s movements
>”What are you apologizing for?”
>”Talking so casually about your family when you’re supposed to be mourning your sister.”
>I then stand up and hug her reassuringly
>”You’re saying that like you aren’t already a part of it. And even if you weren’t, I’d then make you a part of it.”
>She gasps a little and stops stirring and turns around
>”Did you just…”
>”Yep.”
>Her eyes shiver and she almost slams herself against me
>”Faye?” I place my hands on her shoulders and she turns a smiling, slightly teary face to me
>”Thanks, really. I wanted to ask you since last week, but I just couldn’t because of the funeral…”
>”Ask me? To propose to you? That’s a bit weird, but it’s pretty cute how you can be so shy sometimes.” I chuckle and pet her head
>”S-Shut up, dummy.”
>”You’d make a great wife and great mother as well.”
>A simple jab hits my chest and I chuckle again
>”Dumbass, I’ve told you to not say it so casually.” She plants her puffy face to my chest
>”I’m just saying what I truly feel.” I pet her a little and she shyly pulls away to go back to cooking
>”...Thanks.” A simple answer come from her and as I sit down, I see her tail swishing happily
>”So when’s the risotto ready? I’m getting a bit hungry.”
>”Get a plate and I’ll serve you some.” Her voice purrs out and she gives a smile towards me
>Get up and walk to the drawer containing the plates
>I pick up two plates and step next to the purring grey cat
>She giggles a bit and puts some of the risotto on the plates
>I put the plates side-by-side on the table and go pick up two spoons for us to eat with
>Pick the spoons up and sit down next to Faye, who is already sitting at the table
>”Thanks for the dinner.” I simply say as I pass one of the spoons to her and I take a small spoonful of the food in my mouth
>”Is it good?”
>”Yep. You put a lot of love into this, didn’t you?”
>”Maybe.” She also starts eating
>...
>”That was really good. Could you make me lunch for when I have to go to work?”
>”Okay.” She purrs and leans to me
>We share a kiss, her lips tasting like risotto
>Hold her paw as I get up
>She follows me to the living room couch and we sit down side-by-side
>Our eyes meet so do our lips as we pull slowly into an embrace
>”Thanks for being with me.” I say after our kiss ends
>”Same to you.” She turns her face to the outside and I do the same
>The snow falls past the window as we hold each other fondly
>”Hey, so you wanna get married?”
>”Yeah, of course. You did propose to me earlier and you don’t know how happy that made me.” That smile of her, it’s one worth seeing and feeling
>”Well, I do know that it made you so happy you teared up a little.” 
>”Smartass.” She lightly taps me with her knuckle
>”Heh.”
>”...I imagined this would end up being a bit awkward, but for some reason, it doesn’t really feel like that.” She brings herself closer and our cheeks touch, her fur brushing nicely along my skin and she wraps her arms around my neck to pull us more close
>”That just means we fit each other, though we both already knew that.” I scratch behind her ear and she purrs in response
>”Yep.”
>The only sound is the slight fluttering of the wind outside as the snow continues their descent
>Our relaxed bodies slowly lay down on the couch with us laying on our side and she rolls to face me
>She moves herself closer and she feels even warmer than before
>Our arms lock our bodies together
>”I won’t ever let you go.”
>”Except for certain times, like now since I’ve gotta go to the restroom.” She gives a look and I let her go so that she can go do her business
>As she closes the door to the restroom, I get the tv remote, with which I turn on the tv and then I look at the time
>”The news is gonna be on in...about 30 minutes.”
>Tune into some MasterChef
>”Wonder if that famous ram chef is gonna show up as a judge?”
>I spread myself a bit more on the couch and sigh
>’How can I be this relaxed when just a couple hours ago I was crying for Emma? Wonder how I would be if Faye wouldn’t be here right now? I’d rather not think about that.’
>Faye comes back at that moment and drops herself onto my lap
>She huddles herself so that she sirs between my legs with her own folded up to her chest
>I pull her to me a bit and I can hear her purring
>”When do you wanna get married?” She asks a bit timidly
>”Hmmm...Let’s leave that discussion for tomorrow, now we should just enjoy the moment.” I boop her nose with mine and she just smiles back
>”Yeah, let’s.” She pushes us both down onto the couch and I quickly switch the tv off as we embrace
>’Her warmth, body, personality, all of it, I love all that is her.’ I pick her up in my arms and enter our bedroom and she helps to close the door
>...
>I hold onto Faye's paws for a long while, laying with her in the nude and smiling
>An eternity of happy giggling and near silence between us comes to a gentle finish as I speak
>"Faye... I have a question for you I've wanted to ask for a long time... But I think I've been afraid to."
>"I want to do something that might lead into a family eventually. You and me Faye. On the bed, making love properly as we embrace completely in the bare. I..."
>Faye is shaking on top of me a bit, fear and desire flying behind her eyes as she begins to become anxious at the thought of what I'm about to say
>"I want you to bear my children. No... To bear our children. I want for a fiery passionate night between us to hopefully seal in place the beginning of a long and happy life together. I want for us to share a bond that so many others before us find fills them with a joy that is hard to explain much less understand."
>I gently put my hand under her shin, and stare into her deep pools of dazzling emerald as a trill purr escapes her lips
>She's listening as intently as ever, fear absent as a warm almost maternal glow fills her stare
>"I could wait a thousand years to be allowed to feel your gentle embrace. I could step into the cold void of the future knowing I'd have a decade or more to wait to feel our bare skin touch. I could live the rest of my life if I had to, knowing I would never do it if I wasn't allowed... but I at least want you to know how far I want to take our relationship. How far we take our lives together..."
>I lean in gently, kissing her on the lips for a fleeting moment and holding her hand for support as she locks eyes with me
>"As long as I'm with you I'm content with life. I have no regrets. I'm living a dream I know I'll wake up to every day. While we could wait for marriage properly... But why not have a little detour every once in awhile ya know? Embrace the adventure of life to the fullest. Embrace one another in the most passionate way possible and start a new chapter in life. Throw caution to the wind for a moment! Embrace the chaos of life. Just embrace it all. Together."
>The grey cat on top of me doesn't say a word, but instead takes my hands and gently grooms my neck softly, purring and caring for me in a way I can't say I thought anyone ever would
>Breaking away from her grooming, Faye smiles mischievously
>She wiggles her butt and gently rolls me onto the bottom of her as she gets up and her tail stands as tall as it ever has
>"Let me go slip into something really quick. Then we can go at it in a way I'd always hoped you might one day ask of me to."
>I happily nod to Faye as she slips into the walk in closet to the side of her room, her tail making a gentle heart shape behind her glorious butt as she walks in
>She only spends a few moments fumbling with whatever it is she has planned before telling me to close my eyes
>I follow her order with a happy smile gracing my face
>Soft lace brushes against my skin as she climbs onto me, gently whispering for me to open my eyes
>The first thing that catches my eyes are the lacy scarlet clothes she has on, no doubt some rather nice lingerie she's been hiding for a special night
>All of her earlier fears are gone, and underneath her intoxicating clothes is a bare body that's clearly excited
>My hands gently travel up her sides as Faye purrs contently, her lacy bra lifting a bit as her nipples push fiercely into the fabric knowing I'm slowly moving towards them
>"Part of me wants to take all of this off and go at it like normal... but I think we should keep this on and experience a bit of naughtiness together. Let's really go at it tonight. We're not going to mate like we normally do any night..."
>Faye leans in, licking my ear as her purring reaches a powerful tone I've never heard it blaring out with
>"Tonight, we're going to go at it without holding back. I only have one thing I'm going to require you to do tonight." 
>The silence is deafening as she softly bites into my ear and puts her hands onto my shoulders tightly
>A wet stream flows slowly onto my crotch from a good distance above telling me she's as worked up as she's ever been, her teeth letting go of my ear to whisper her only command as soft as the wind
>"Breed. Me."
>I don't say a word as I fling the cat off of my waist and under, pinning her down and biting into her soft neck fur like I've gone mad
>A nearly orgasmic thrill escapes her lips as I press into her slowly, whispering a response that makes her tail wrap around my leg as I carefully position her legs over my shoulders
>"I promise you Faye, I'm not going to hold back a single drop."
>And with a powerful first thrust that caused her legs to go limp on my shoulders, we began
>Every thrust I started with was the crescendo of our last encounter in this position, powerful deep thrusts with a solid speed to them
>Her legs shake under my thrusts, but her pleasure is obvious by how she's gripping her ankles and growling with intense passion; Faye is very clearly enjoying tonight's somewhat more powerful session 
>With that in mind, I'm still mindful she is bit on the small and little side so I don't push with every last drop of strength I have
>Every slap of our bodies together makes her just a bit wetter and her eyes a bit more sharp as I feel an unusual heat building in her loins
>I try to remember what I'd been reading in some BHA guides that got sent across the ocean to help out anthro human couples, and it hits me like a ton of bricks as Faye pants and grips my own hips in a much more primal display than normal
>Sometimes if an anthro is close enough to heat the body can trigger it early and prime itself for fertility a bit early, as long as their mate is pushing them into it hard enough with a powerful session or two
>Just the beginning of tonight's primal session was triggering her heat, and could really ignite it if I continued on like this...
>So I grip her hip with my right hand and pull it towards myself, using my my other hand to pin down her free one on the bed
>I'm not going to spark her heat tonight with a simple whimper, if it goes off it's going to be an explosion that could flatten a city
>And judging by the raspy purring she's letting out of her throat, the fact that her spare hand is rubbing her gentle love button like it was a scratch off ticket, and the warm smell of heat slowly gathering; I've certainly pushed her to the point it's crashing down on her
>What just moments ago was plentiful lubrication is turning rapidly into overly stimulating rivers of it
>Gently slaps of flesh now resonate with wet skin on densely packed fur, her wetness soaking her legs and beginning to slowly trickle down her tail and abs
>Taking the moment to make everything hotter for her, I let go of her hand long enough to flip down her left leg onto the bed before doing the same to her right
>After her other foot drops down she puts her lacy paws onto my legs, staring directly at me while I plow away into her now scorching lower body
>And it truly was scorching, every pulsating hit to the back walls of her body splashed me with hot liquid that I felt should be burning me on contact 
>It glides over my fully powered member in spades, heating me as much as she was heating herself
>As the first tingles of my own impending conclusion march forward, Faye screams out to me that she's doing her best to stop hers from blowing her hips out
>Her free hand is gently and delicately pressing her swollen button as I feel her body clamping down harshly, but the wetness of her heat refuses to let me grind to a stop no matter how viciously it chokes
>I rub her face and she stares into my eyes as she tries to whisper she's sorry, and I lock lips for a moment to let her known she shouldn't feel bad about having this much fun
>Her explosion hits immediately as I pull away from the kiss, and she pulls my hand tightly back into hers so that I can push forward until I'm at my own limit
>Faye's fingers lock into mine as she happily grinds along her powerful orgasm, preparing for my own to be unleashed into her waiting body
>Not long after I can feel myself slipping as my body twitches softly in preparation, Faye taking my hand and putting it on her hip so she can grab my face and pull it close to hers
>Her voice commands attention as her primal instincts force their way through her vocal cords, giving her normally tame voice a biting edge of passion 
>"Tame the wild beast of my body. Break down the last barrier between us. Shatter every last instinctual hangup I have about this. Destroy the very last thing I'm afraid of..."
>I feel myself start to slip as Faye's legs kick out from under me, slamming into my hips and driving me to begin to finish while she forces me to pump with every ounce of strength I have wether I want to or not
>"There is nothing I can see in my life more fulfilling than knowing that in the end I will have carried your children. That you would give me the honor to raise your daughters and sons."
>She growls into my ear with an entirely primal affection I've never seen as one of her hands tries to crush my fingers, her other barely controllable as it tries to keep her claws at bay in my grasp
>"Mark me as your wife, Anon! Make me a mother!"
>I explode with the force of a megaton bomb, thrusting as hard as I can in her locked legs as her arms lose their power and I grab them both by the palms and slam them onto the bed
>Her legs loosen up just enough to pound as vicious as I ever have into her, holding her arms down on the bed and gripping them in a stranglehold
>Both sets of her lips lock onto me as I deliver more and more of her most intense primal desire to be a mother with every second that ticks by, my teeth vibrating through the purring in her tongue as it crashed against mine
>Every pulse of her now hot body flowing with a heat I triggered early brings the percent to have this work up by a whole percent
>Every thrust adds another, as I slam into her with a passion I can't begin to explain how I was mustering
>Five intense minutes pass as her orgasm stays nearly fully at its peak, her instincts forcing her to attempt to pull more of myself into her as my own threatens to dehydrate itself with the volume it produces for her to have
>Eventually, with my once rigid member beginning to slowly fade away, I concede that the battle is over and let myself slowly leave her burning hot body
>The intensity of our bare skin battle dawns on me as far more than the average condom's worth slowly begins to trickle out of Faye's body, a decent amount flowing free before her body realized it was losing hard fought warmth and locked away all it could inside of her
>Finally, as I find I'm barely able to breath and Faye's legs slowly but surely slump onto the bed; I fall on top of her and do my best to get my spent body to move
>As my arms threaten to lock with my fingers in a vice with hers, we manage to roll onto our sides and let gravity pull us apart
>My left hand lets go of hers for a moment, only so I can move to grip her palm when we're both in a relaxed position beside one another
>"I love you, Faye."
>"I love you too, Anon."
>The sheets are on the floor, the covers are on the other side, the pillows are strewn about the bed...
>No regrets are felt by either of as we begin to fall into an exhausted slumber beside one another, dreams flooding in to tease us both of the future to come
>Tonight we'll both rest and enjoy the company of each other in happy silence, held hands somehow connecting our dreams together in reality and our minds
>Tomorrow may have many trials and challenges to bare their fangs at us
>But we'll be fighting it arm in arm, together as...
>...the adventure of life goes on


>Part 12

>The gleaming white dress of hers shines bright in the lowering sunlight
>’Like I said, cute and cuddly. And sexy.’
>I move my attention to the ring on my left hand’s ring finger and then I concentrate on driving
>Drive up to the snow-covered front yard and park a bit outside the front door
>Exit the car and go the passenger seat
>Open the door and carry her out of the car and into the house
>”So, I guess we’re married now. I honestly can’t put it into words how...happy I am right now.” She’s tearing up a little and hugs me while I take my shoes off
>”Yeah, I can’t either.” I continue holding her as I walk up the stairs
>Let her down as I reach the decorated living room
>She sighs and ruffles her face a bit before starting to take off the dress
>I’ve already taken off my suit and switched to casual clothes consisting of slacks and a long-sleeve
>”Need help?”
>”Yeah, help me out of this dress and into something more comfortable.” She whines and her tail signifies her annoyance with its movements 
>”Yep.” I start to help her out of the dress and after a good five minutes, we get her out of it
>”Never wearing that again.”
>”Let’s hope that’ll be the case.” I give her and embrace to her mostly naked body, save a bra and panties
>”What are you implying, dear husband of mine?” She smugly turns to me and goes off to get something to wear
>”Nothing, my lovely wife.”
>”You’re making me blush, now let’s have dinner and enjoy this honeymoon the way we should!” She happily jump hugs me after having changed into the button-up plus jeans combo that appears to be her favourite outfit now
>”Watching anime and playing games the whole time while cuddling and stuff? And maybe a little gunpla-building on the side.”
>”You know it. I just really couldn’t bother with wasting money on a week-long trip that’s too fucking expensive.”
>”Watch your language, wouldn’t would the little one taking after their mother like that.”
>”Oh please, our kid is not gonna learn swears ever!” She goes mother-mode and I chuckle a bit in response
>Her body has changed a bit, her hips seems a bit wider and breasts also seem a bit more, for the lack of a better word, bigger
>”What should we name them?” I sit down on the couch and turn the tv on
>”I’m thinking Mikael if it’s a boy, if it’s a girl then...Aura.” She slowly sits herself down next to me
>”They sound like the perfect names for them.” I pull her closer
>”So, should I make dinner?” I pull our noses together for a boop
>”Yep, let’s do that.” She gives a quick peck and we go together into the kitchen
>”What do you want?”
>”Spaghetti and meatballs.” She answers with hungering eyes
>”Alrighty then. Chef Anon is in the house, so you can just rest back.”
>She sits down with a small giggle and I turn on the stove and place a pot full of water on it
>”I don’t see you cooking that often even though you work at a restaurant. Why is that?”
>”I just like to sit down and watch you happily cook for me than do it myself.”
>”You mean you’re just lazy.”
>”I wouldn’t say that, I’m more of the “Watch my beautiful and pur wife cook dinner for me” -type of person.”
>”Pure? I wouldn’t say that…” Her mood seems down and I ain’t having that
>”You are to me, being my wife and all.” I step closer to her and grab her paws
>”I don’t care what others think of you, the only thing that matters to me that you’re happy. And you being happy means I’m happy.” I hug her with an added kiss
>”You’re going overboard with the compliments, but thanks. You really are the greatest husband I could ask for.” She flicks her finger at my forehead and that gets a chuckle out of me
>I then give her a small kiss and decide to cook the meatballs as well
>Take out the mincemeat out of the fridge and some seasonings from a shelf above the stove
>”Spicy meatballs or normal?”
>”Normal, thanks.”
>”Okay then.”
>...
>”Alright, here you go, Madam.” I bow to her a little after handing her a plate of the spaghetti and meatballs (with a bit of sauce for added flavour)
>”Hey, I’m that old yet, sir.”
>”Neither am I, but I guess we’ll grow old together.”
>”That’d be really nice.”
>I turn to get myself a plate as well
>Use a spaghetti ladle to put some spaghetti on the plate, trying not to spill any of the excess water
>use another ladle to put a few meatballs and some sauce on the plate as well
>The recipe for the meatballs and sauce was something I learned from the restaurant cooks, cool dudes
>”Like it?” I place my plate down next to hers and I see her happily slurping the spaghetti
>Her mouth is full of food, so she just nods and I notice a bit of sauce on her cheek
>Take a napkin from the package of napkins resting on the table and wipe her cheek
>She seems to swallow the spaghetti and open her mouth to say something
>Kiss on the lips, just because
>Break away and turn to get a fork
>”This is really good. Where’d you learn to do the sauce?”
>”At the restaurant I work at. One of the cooks there taught it to me.”
>”Could you teach it to me too?” She eats a meatball and she coughs
>Pat her back firmly a few times and she gets some milk to drink
>”T-Thanks.” She sits back down and continues eating the rest of her food
>”No need to rush eating, we have ten days of vacation here so we can take our time.”
>”Can I get seconds?” She hands me the empty plate and I oblige to her request
>We ended up eating all of the food I made, no left-overs whatsoever
>”Thanks for the food.” She sighs and leans on me, looking pretty tired
>”Wanna go to sleep?” I ask as we stand up at the same time
>”Yeah, let’s.” She simply smiles and holds my hand
>We walk into our bedroom and go down on the bed
>It feels a little cold, but we just usually huddle up together and that solves the problem quite quickly
>She pulls the sheets over us and she comes closer to me while hugging me tightly
>Move my arms to hold her close and pet her lightly
>”Goodnight.” She purrs and mushes her face against my chest while tightening her squeeze
>”Goodnight.” I say and let myself fall asleep to her warmth
>...
>The months pass and the mid-summer’s evening is where the first cries of life are let out into the world
>”Congratulations sir, you’ve got two healthy children. A boy and a girl.”  The head nurse says as I stand up from the chair and he takes off his mouth cover to reveal a small, but sincere smile and I see another nurse carrying two bundles of sheets to Faye and she takes them with open arms
>I’m motioned to wash my hands I do so quickly
>I then shakily walk up to the bedside where Faye rests with our children in her arms
>She laughs a little and looks to me with her green eyes shining with pride and a smile plastered across her face
>The small little precious beings as nestled comfortably in sheets for warmth and I bring my index finger closer to the girl's face
>The boy looks mostly human, but with ears being like his mother’s and he also seems to have a furred tail
>The girl looks what I’d imagine Faye looked like as a baby, but with a small patch of fur looking it will grow into human-like hair like what some anthros have
>Her eyes are like her fathers's and she tries to grasp my finger and does so
>I can't control myself and cry a bit
>"Aaahh...She is adorable, fur like her mother's and eyes amber like mine." My voice shakes from just the feeling of my child's innocent touch
>"I've become such a softie lately." I sigh and turn my attention to the boy, him staring at me with wide eyes
>"Well isn’t that perfect for being a father? You can carry Mikael if you want to.” Faye kindly says and I take the coddled boy in my arms
>Faye then begins breastfeeding the girl and I avert my eyes
>She also giggles as the small baby starts feeding and a different nurse comes to help
>”So, Mikael and Aura, right?” I ask as I turn my eyes back to the boy
>He tries to reach for me and I put my finger so that he can grab it
>”Hey Mikael, it’s your papa.” I say to the baby as he makes noises while playing with my finger and I can’t help but smile
>”Would you like to feed the boy now?” The nurse suggests to Faye and I turn to her
>She hands me Aura and Faye begins feeding Mikael
>Aura gives the almost same response as before, reaching for my finger that I wave in front of her
>”Hey, here’s papa.” I whisper as these warm feelings tighten within me
>’These are our children, I could honestly die happy. Not right now, maybe when these kids are all grown up and living on their own and all that jazz...But I’m thinking too far ahead.’
>”Your children and wife will stay in the hospital for two days, because we have to make sure everything going fine.” The head nurse comes up to me
>”That’s fine, would it be okay if I stayed here a little while?”
>”It’s alright, you can stay here for as long you need to.” He reassures me and goes back to doing something
>”So, now we’re parents. Kinda exciting, isn’t it?” Faye giggles and I notice that Aura seems to have fallen asleep
>”Yeah, here begins a new part of our adventure of life.” I rock Mikael lightly in the my arms
>”And that adventure also begun for these two.” Faye touches the small girl's cheek and hums a little
>”I think we can pretty easily keep to that promise.”
>”Yep, I think so too.”
>...
>I left the hospital after staying there for another hour and Faye pretty much forced me to go back home
>I did eventually comply, though reluctantly
>There I lay, on our living room couch and I stare at the ceiling
>A feeling in my gut is making me feel anxious, is it excitement? Whatever it is, I can't take it anymore
>”Arrrgh!” I yell and grab my jacket and run downstairs
>Put on my shoes and go back upstairs
>Out the door in our bedroom that leads to the back yard
>Start running past the small yard and up the small hill
>Climb until I reach the cliff overseeing our house and the neighbours
>Two deep breaths and I take a moment to feel the brisk summer wind breezing by
>”WOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! I’M GOING TO LIVE HAPPY AND NOTHING CAN STOP ME!!” I yell to the air and my voice echoes through the forest, probably getting the attention of anyone passing by
>”And now I’m a bit calmer.” I let out a sigh and just stand there
>Look to the left and notice the moon glinting brightly in the night sky
>”...”
>”Be it your strength, selfishness, weakness or tears..”
>”I will take them all in together with you~”
>”I whisper gently to the moon reflected on my window: I will not make you regret…”
>”I love you, but I can’t say it well! I want you to stay by me always with your honest and frank heart!” I spread my arms and dance wildly 
>”I can feel it; the eternity i was looking for..”
>”Is right within you~!” I raise my hands to the sky before lowering them
>”Phew, that felt good. Probably should get inside, since it’s really cold out here…”
>”Why isn’t she here at a time like this? I’ve been separated from her for only about six hours and I already feel like I can’t live anymore.”
>”Just have to wait two days and then she, Mikael and Aura will come home.” I continue talking to myself as I enter back into the house
>”I wonder how she’s doing.” I take off my shoes and go hang my jacket on the coat rack
>Go back to our room and flop down on the bed and roll myself into the sheets
>’Two days and my life will effectively change. For the better, of course.’
>And so the adventure of life goes on and at the same time, begins anew

>Part 13, Final

>A yawn parts past my lips and I turn to look outside for a moment
>’As much as I like winter, summer mornings are so much better.’
>”Still sleepy?” Faye, aka the best wife in the whole world, passes me some porridge for breakfast
>Her paw passes a spoon and I take it softly, taking note of her long-sleeve and jeans worn beneath that same heart-symbol apron
>”Thank you. And yeah, still a bit numb.”
>”Should I judo-throw you? It’d wake you up.”
>”Please no, the last time you did that I couldn’t walk straight for three days.” I blow lightly on the spoonful of porridge and then eat it
>”You’re exaggerating it. Your muscles just were too tired.” She sits to my left and Starts eating her plate of porridge
>”Eh, but how is your own practice group doing?” I take another spoonful, this one a bit more hot than the last
>”They’re doing fine, a couple of the boys are constantly staring at me though.”
>”Good taste, but they better know that I already claimed you.” I say, and a soft chop on top of the head hits me
>”Thanks, but that’s a bit inappropriate.”
>”Just telling the truth.” I kiss her and then go back to eating my breakfast
>The creek of a door opening snaps me from my thoughts and I look up to a yawning twelve-year old boy wearing a t-shirt and shorts
>”Morning, Mikael.” Faye respond with timing that only a mother could have and stands up and walks over to the boy
>”Morning, mom. Morning, dad.” He rubs his sleepy eyes and his greyish hair and ears look like the worst case of bed hair I’ve seen
>”Is your sister awake?” Faye pats the boy and then carefully opens the door to Aura’s room and I look at the newspaper on the table, wondering if it’s today’s or yesterday's
>”Oh, she's still sleeping.” The mother cat retreats and closes the door more carefully than before
>Finish eating my porridge and thank Faye for the food before taking the paper and reading through with passing interest
>’Did I remember to order that gunpla for Faye’s birthday?’ The random thought makes it’s way into my mind-space and the cat in question sits back at the table and goes back to eating breakfast
>”Can I take some?” Mikael asks and Faye simply nods
>The boy then gets a deep plate and scoops the porridge onto it with the kitchen ladle
>He puts the ladle back into the pot and gets a spoon, then going to sit opposite of us
>”Hey, dad.” Mikael calls and I fold the newspaper, it having nothing interesting to read, while turning my eyes to him
>”Could you help me with a gunpla today?”
>”Which gunpla?” I place the newspaper aside and stand up
>”The blue Zaku one.” He giggles out and I place the plate in the sink before swirling around to face my son
>”It’s no Zaku, boy! No Zaku!” I recite from memory while striking a pose
>Faye almost loses it and Mikael just giggles
>”Good one, dad!” He happily laughs
>”Thank you, Thank you. Now, did you need help with the Gouf or something else?” I step forward and kiss my wife again as I pass her, prompting a chuckle from her
>”I need help with the V2 AB.” He finishes his small portion of porridge and leads me to his room, which was my old room before a certain grey frizzy cat moved in
>”Okay, let’s see the patient's condition.” I crack my knuckles for no real reason except that I think it’s cool to be done aside one-liners
>...
>”Thanks for the help.” Mikael says as he poses the model with a soft touch, as taught by me
>”No problem. I’m gonna check on your sister.” I stand up and exit the room
>Turn to the right and walk to the next door, opening it carefully
>No lights or pc on
>A groan comes from the bed on the right and I see the jumble of sheets move
>”Aura? You awake?”
>”Dad, what time is it…” A voice emits from the bed and I quickly look at the clock on the small drawer next to the bed
>”It’s...9:23.”
>”Oh, guess I’ll get up.” Aura throws the sheets off her body and her long hair is the first thing to get my attention
>”Want me to brush and tie your hair?” I ask and take out a brush from the drawer’s top drawer
>”Yeah…” She yawns and I sit down next to her and go to work
>I brush gently, knowing how she likes her long hair to be in good condition
>”How are you doing?”
>”Pretty good.” she says and rubs her grey-furred cheeks a little 
>”That’s good to hear.” I finish my brushing and take a simple hairband from the drawer
>I quickly tie her hair into a ponytail and then stand up
>”Thanks for that. What’s for breakfast?”
>”Porridge.” I exit the room and flop down on the living room couch
>”Again? We had that last week.”
>”No need to complain since it tastes good.” I look over and see Aura getting some to eat
>’Knew she would take it.’
>”Oh, morning Aura.” Faye pats the girl
>”Morning.” The younger cat sits down at the table and I turn on the tv and hope that there’s something interesting to watch
>The rest of the summer morning goes by rather uneventfully and the day goes to afternoon
>I sit on the couch with Faye huddled next to me
>”Time rolls by fast, huh?” I say as I pet the woman who I can’t really let go of
>”Yup. I sure does.” She then giggles a bit
>I look at her confusedly and she smiles back at me
>”I just find it a bit funny how all the specific little things had to happen in order for us to reach this point. Like you coming to visit Laila all those years ago and her going for Jyrki.”
>”She probably would have shot me down anyways. I’m just happy to know I’ve got the greatest woman by my side now.”
>”You really are a romantic.” She kisses me and we laugh after
>”I know.” I scratch her fur more and reminisce about all the times I’ve done this before
>”...Taking care of two children is a bit of hassle, but it’s the fun kind of hassle.” She comes a bit closer and I throw my right arm around her shoulder to keep her there
>”Yeah, agreed.”
>”Wanna sing for a bit?” She stands up
>”Why not?” I get up and stand in front of her short body
>”...”
>”...From the heart we all cry for joy and pain…” We sing as our arms envelop each other's bodies
>”From the heart we all smile and looove~” We sway a little and I place my hand gently on her head as we tighten our embrace
>”All the sadness and then pain I’ve felt”
>”All the happiness and joy I’ve felt”
>After the time goes by, all is in the past…”
>”Bittersweet pastel memories~”
>”...”
>”All the books my father gave to me”
>”All the books I gave to you my love” 
>”Each time the book is close, the story’s left behind”
>”And I get lost alone…”
>”...”
>”When I was young I believed there was a sun that goes up and a sun that goes down”
>”In my heart I always thought they were two things”
>”And the moon and the stars in the night”
>”Were the same lights that lit up the streets…”
>”The were the same to my young eyes~”
>A magical feel wells in me and I open my eyes a little, only to glance and see the kids peeking out of their rooms without making a sound
>I internally laugh and get back to singing
>”Tears of sadness and the tears of joy…” This part gets a few memories to rise up, but that doesn't stop me
>”After crying it is all the same”
>”It’ll come down to the though, these are from the heart”
>”The goodness that we share from our heart~”
>”...”
>”All the mornings when I think of you”
>”All the evenings when I feel for you~”
>”You bring out the poet in me, philosopher too, my dear…”
>”The dreaming girl in...me~”
>”You bring out the best in me”
>”You bring the dream...to me”
>We continue swaying a little before stopping and just staring at each other
>”The kids are staring.” I whisper and turn to see they aren’t anymore
>”Were they? Well at least they didn’t interrupt us.” Faye smiles and gives a slight kiss
>”Wanna build some gunpla?” I ask as I step towards the stairs
>”Yeah, let’s do that.” We walk downstairs and enter the workshop to select the models we’ll build now
>”I’ll take the Nu Gundam.” I pick up the big box from the shelf and set it down on the table
>”Then I’ll choose the Sazabi.” She picks the box the was next to the one I took
>”Let’s get to building these then.”
>As we get to snapping and building, I can fully say wholeheartedly and doubtlessly…
>I am happy
>And so the adventure of life goes on
