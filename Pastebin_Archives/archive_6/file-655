Dumb CYOA-like start of a story. Initially based on artwork by Burgerkiss: https://e621.net/post/show/2013637
Anthro is whatever species the user prefers.
Responses are lettered for ease of following, though not intended as a CYOA. Read it as three seperate yet parallel stories, or as if you as the warrior are stuck in some groundhog day bullshit.

CYOA-Like, Community Driven/Written, Game-like, Fantasy

---------------------------

> Be Anon, the Human Warrior from an unknown reality.
> Make way into shady tavern where adventurers go between quests and jobs, looking for some drink to relax with.
> There is a crowd gathered near the bar, all males, all jeering at a skimpily clad anthro amazon. Despite her physique, she is clearly overwhelmed by the number of bodies that are surrounding her and openly talking about her like a piece of meat.

What do you do?

A) Grope Her
B) Pet Her
C) Buy a pair of ales, get her attention and wave her over to my table. See what she does at that point.

>> (A)
> She grabs you arm, and breaks it. Following up with a punch to the face.
> Crowds disperses when they realise she can actually fight.
> She svagely stomps your head into the hardwood floor, bone and viscera spray out from under her paw.
> GAME OVER
> BAD ENDING.

>> (B & C)
> Her nerves are settled a little, and you manage to pry her away from the crowd.
> Lead her to a table at the back that is out of sight of the other patrons.

A) I load my latest save and choose hugging her from behind
B/C) Continue petting her.

>> (A)
> RESYNCHRONISATION IN PROGRESS
> SYNCHRONISED
> As you're walking up behind her you get a mild headache and soreness in your arm.
> You attempt to assert dominance over your fellow man, and the amazonian before you.

> She jumps at the sudden constriction your impose upon her. The gathered crowd gasps, taking a step back, and await the anthro's response.
https://dadi.lapo.it/1570307018
> She easily breaks your grip and knocks you backwards onto your ass.
> Crowd quickly disperses, as she turns to each of the onlookers, clearly pissed off and growling.

>> (B/C)
> She is fine with being petted for now.
> Occasionally, she nuzzles against your palm.
> After a little while, she seems to be getting annoyed at how you're not doing anything different, nor talking.

A) Try to say sweet things to her and tell her to come with me
B) Belly rubs.
C) Ask her where she's from and what she's doing here.

>> (A)
> Her attention affixes to you.
> One of her hands reaches towards a seerated dagger at her hip.
https://dadi.lapo.it/1570307916
> She advances on you, one paw resting on your chest, the dagger drawn.
> She sighs, and replaces the dagger as your words take affect, stepping off you and returning to the bar.

>> (B)
> She quickly grabs your wrist, eyes snapping to yours with an intense stare that tells you "too far" as she shakes her head.
> She's not about to smash you, but seems she is not wanting something that intimate right now.

>> (C)
> She leans back into the seat, taking a long drink from the tankard in front of her.
> She tells you she's from a land far of to the east, and that she has traveled here due to being exiled from her home. What money she could use is running low and she was hoping to find some form of employment.

A) Ask her why the hell she's wearing so little
B) Give her Treats
C) Ask if she wants some help, seeing I'm between jobs too.

>> (A)
> She looks at her own choice of attire, then around the bar at the various humans and anthros andhow they dress themselves.
> The Tavern is in a region that would be described as temperate, and the seasons are slowly moving to Fall, so most are dressed for the potential of cold weather.
> Her own attire is very revealing, only covering her breasts and privates. On each hip is a very stylised yet obviously sharp Dagger, and she carries a leather pack of sorts strap from one shoulder to the hip on the opposite side.
> She merely shrugs and says she didn't have much choice on what she could take before coming this far west.

>> (B)
> You decide to offer an olive branch, producing some dry salted meat from a pouch, and offering it to her.
> She slowly accepts the meat treat, but her eyes are wide with hunger, and there is a hint of drool at the corner of her mouth.

>> (C)
> She accepts your offer for working together.
> She admits she does not have skills in crafts, as she was trained as a warrior before all else.
> She remarks how she is proficient in all weapons known to her tribe.

A) Offer her a place to stay. And less revealing clothing.
B) Offer her the chance to get some armor. Bitches love metal breastplates.

>> (A)
> She looks at you with suspicion, and asks why'd you'd invite a total stranger from another land into your home?
> She does concede that she may need to acquire warmer clothes for the regions' fall season, but reminds you that her funds are low at the moment.

>> (B)
> She looks to the few other Mercs in heavy platemail, and sneers that it looks no better then the males of her tribe trying to endorse their assets.
> She suggest that maybe armour similar to the rogue in the corner would be better, as it would need impede her abilities in a fight, but would be warmer for the weather.
