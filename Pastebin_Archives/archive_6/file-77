Night With a Wolfess
(Sequel to Day with a Wolfess)

>Be Anon.
>You out were out deep innawoods, having yourself a nice mini-vacation.
>Or you had been, up until a couple days ago.
>A couple nights ago, you had woken up to find a large Wolfess in your tent.
>At first you had thought she was going to bite your head off, but instead she had just pulled you into her soft embrace and cuddled with you all night.
>She then had spent the next morning and afternoon with you, but had abruptly departed.
>She had left you a couple mementos, but hadn't returned.
>You had waited all of yesterday for her to return, but she never showed up.
>Sadly, you couldn't wait for her any longer. You were low on food, and you had to return to your job.
>You were going to spend one last night in the forest, then you were going to head back to civilization to resume your monotonous existence.

>It was almost nightfall, and you were just finishing your dinner.
>M.R.E. spaghetti, your least favorite menu item.
>You throw the plastic waste from the packaging away into small bag you had brought with you for trash.
>Looking back at your tent, you sigh.
>To get into it she had torn a huge hole into it.
>She had kept you warm when she had slept alongside you, but when you slept alone last night, it was almost unbearably cold.
>She had broken your sleeping bag's zipper, so you couldn't even fully close it.
>That's what you get for camping in the middle of fall, you suppose.

>You step into your tent through the gaping hole the Wolfess had left, and you sit down on the sleeping bag.
>You take off your shoes, but keep all your other clothing on.
>Unless you wanted to freeze your ass off, you had to sleep fully dressed in your jeans, socks, shirt, and jacket.
>It might not be the most comfortable, but you would be headed back home tomorrow and you would be able to sleep back in your own bed.
>You lived by yourself in a cheap apartment on the edge of town.
>You weren't in contact with any of your family, as they had kind of disowned you after you had a drunken incident involving a snowblower, the family cat, and a gallon of gasoline a few years ago. Fun times.
>You didn't have any real friends, just the other janitorial staff you worked with at a local office.
>You had taken what little vacation time you had to go on this camping trip deep in the woods.
>It was said that Tribal Anthros were occasionally spotted in these woods, but you ignored the warnings.
>You were kind of glad that you did, as if you had went to some other campground then you would have never met the Wolfess.
>You sigh, and lay back on your sleeping bag, closing it as much as you can.
>You shut your eyes and try to sleep before it gets too cold.

>That night, you wake up in your tent all cold and shivering.
>You gasp from the sudden shock of cold, and you can see your breath as you exhale.
>Damn, it had to be maybe 20 degrees outside.
>It was windy out, and it was blowing directly into your tent from the huge hole the Wolfess had slashed into it.
>Well, shit. You guess you can't just ignore the cold tonight.
>You reach over and turn on a small electric lantern.
>You grab the lantern, throw your shoes on, and head outside.
>If you didn't want to freeze to death tonight, you had to find a way to make it so the wind wasn't blowing into your tent.
>You didn't want to risk trying to turn it. If you took the stakes that were holding the tent out, then the whole damn thing could blow away.
>You step outside the tent and HOLY SHIT is it cold out!
>You cross your arms and rub them together, trying in vain to warm yourself.
>A scary thought crosses your mind:
>You had informed your coworkers you were taking some days off, but you didn't tell anyone where you were going.
>If you froze to death out here, nobody would ever find your corpse.

>Shaking your head to dispel the bad thoughts, you examine your tent.
>It was a really small dome tent. You had gotten it for $20 at a local sporting goods shop awhile back.
>You could really see where the $20 had went. The thing was really cheap looking, and didn't even have a rain shield.
>You looked around your campsite for something to lean against the hole, but there was nothing but pinecones and dead leaves.
>You really wish that Wolfess was here. She had slept alongside you after she had torn the hole, and even though you were in your underwear, you had still kept really warm.
>Sadly, you didn't think she was coming back anytime soon.
>You go over to the fire, and try to start it up.
>No luck. It had rained a bit yesterday, and all the wood and kindling was wet.
>You were going to die in the fucking woods all because you wanted some time off of your unfulfilling job.
>Dammit, /out/ hadn't prepared you for something like this!

>You stand back up next to the dead fire, wondering what you're going to do.
>Your toes and fingers are starting to feel numb, and your jacket isn't keeping any heat in.
>Suddenly, you hear some noises from the bushes.
>Please please please be the Wolfess.
>You see a figure emerge from the darkness, and it's a bit hard to make it out.
>But you can't mistake that silhouette. It's a canine for sure!
>It walks over to you and the light from the lantern falls upon it.
>Two things register in your mind as you look at it's face.
>One. Yeah, that's a tribal canine all right.
>Two. Oh shit, this one is NOT your Wolfess.

>Looking at the Wolf, he was clearly male.
>His fur was a light brown color, and he wore no chest wrap.
>He wore roughly made fur shorts, along with a leather belt to hold them up.
>On the belt he only carried a stone hatchet.
>He stood a couple feet away from you, looking you dead in the eyes.
>You're too scared to move. What is he going to do? Punish you for being in his tribe's territory?
>Maybe the Wolfess was only trying to have some fun with you before you had to be killed.
>You had a knife with you, but it was back in your tent.
>When you turn to look at the tent, the Wolf suddenly charges you.
>You drop the lantern as he grabs you and slings you over his shoulder.
>He looks over his shoulder at you, and mumbles something to you in his incomprehensible language.
>He starts to walk at a brisk pace through the woods, in the direction of where the Wolfess went when you last saw her.
>Shit, where is he taking you!?
>You get one last glimpse at your camp, but eventually you can no longer see the light from the lantern you had dropped.

>The trip through the forest is a bumpy one.
>You had stopped struggling after awhile; the cold sapping your strength.
>When the Wolf had felt you go limp, he stopped to make sure you were okay.
>When he saw you were still awake, he gave a strange smile at you, and then proceeded to run.
>You were bouncing on his shoulder, and it was hurting your ribs.
>You hear a howl in the distance, and he stops.
>He pulls you off of his shoulder, and sets you down on your feet.
>Looking in the direction of the howl, you can see lights.
>It's probably fires from his tribe.
>You try to pull away from the Wolf, terrified of what you think is about to happen.
>He isn't having any of it though, and grabs you firmly by the arm.
>He points a clawed finger at you, and says something to you in his language.
>You don't know what he's saying, but it's clearly meant to chastise you for trying to run.
>He starts walking, and yanks you along after him.
>You're terrified, and have forgotten all about the cold that's currently eating at your bones.
>After five minutes of walking towards the distant lights, you approach the edge of the Village.

>The Wolf leads you through the village.
>It's larger than you thought it would be. It seems that they all live in rounded square huts made of pelts stretched over a wooden frame. In many huts, smoke is pouring out of a raised hole in the center of the roofs.
>There are some campfires outside burning too, with wolves holding spears sitting around them. They're likely guards or warriors protecting the tribe members while they sleep.
>As you are led through the village, you can see multiple Wolves poke their heads out of their huts to get a look at you. Many of them have probably never even seen a human before, and here one was walking through their village.
>You are led to the largest hut in the middle of the village.
>The wolf ushers you inside the door, and you reluctantly enter.
>You're instantly warmed by the heat of a small fire burning in the center of the hut. It's sitting in a small pit, and has a flat stone laying over it. On the stone is a small ceramic cup full of some strange liquid.
>Inside, an old Wolf is sitting cross-legged. His fur is is black, but grayed around his muzzle.
>He's wearing fur trousers, and a deerskin shawl around his shoulders. A decorative headdress adorns his head.
>He smiles at you, and gestures to a mat near him.
>Looking behind you, you can the the brown Wolf is standing outside the door, watching you. Likely to make sure you don't make a run for it.
>There's no way you would ever make it out of the village.
>Resigning yourself to your fate, you walk over to the mat and sit on it, facing the old Wolf.

>To your great surprise, the old Wolf greets you in your own language.
>"Hello, Human."
>"I am the Elder of this village. My name is Segenam. Yours?"
>You're stunned by the introduction, but you manage to stammer out a greeting, telling him your name.
>"My greetings to you, Anon. It has been many, many moons since a Human has been in this Village."
>"We are the Twin Paw Clan. We have lived here for countless generations."
>"I was told by the fisher-woman Kanti that you had constructed a hut on our land."
>You stammer out an apology, and tell him you didn't mean to offend him or his tribe.
>You tell him that if he let you go just this once, you promise they would never see you again.
>He raises an eyebrow upon hearing this, and tells you:
>"Hmmm? Oh, you are nervous. There is no need for that. We will not harm you."
>You sigh in relief. That's one burden off of your shoulders.
>He continues:
>"Kanti has bonded with you. She tells me you have knowledge of fire-making, and you willingly bonded with her."
>Kanti must be the Wolfess you met a couple days ago. You ask him what he meant by "bonding", and he responds:
>"Ehh... Being together. You rested in her embrace. You bathed her. Both of these are traditional courting rituals."
>He gives a small smile.
"She tells me she enjoys your scent, as well."
>"I extend to you an invitation to join my Tribe. I understand that this may be a sudden choice, but you must choose now."
>Shit, things were moving really fast here. First he tells you that he isn't going to kill you, then he tells you that the Wolfess wants to be your wife or something, and now he's invited you to join the tribe...
>He continues:
>"If you accept, you will be treated as one of our own. You will be expected to contribute to the Tribe, and participate in our rituals."
>You ask him why he wants you to join the Tribe, and he reponds, shaking his grey muzzle.
>"Not me. Kanti wishes for you to join us. She wants you to be her life-mate."
>Damn, the Wolfess really does want to be your wife.
>"Anon, you must choose. I am old, and I wish to sleep soon."
>Oh man, he's really putting you on the spot here.
>You take a few seconds to contemplate your choices.
>You can either go back to monotonous life, work as an underpaid janitor, and go home to an empty bed every day until you die....
>Or you can join the Tribe, and actually contribute to your community. And every night you would come home to a warm Wolfess to cuddle you until you fall asleep...
>Yeah, this an easy choice.

>You tell him you'll stay with the Tribe, and he smiles.
>"Good. Kanti will be happy, and it will be nice to have the knowledge of a Human with us."
>Speaking of Humans, you ask him how he knows English.
>"When I came of age, I left the Tribe and lived among your people for several years. After awhile, I returned."
>"My knowledge of the outside world made me a valuable member of the tribe, and when I reached the proper age, I was made Elder of the Tribe."
>"Of course, your knowledge makes you valuable as well. We occasionally go out to trade with your peoples. We trade furs and meat for medicines and other trinkets."
>"You would be a good interpreter for these transactions. I am old, and I find myself unable to make the long journey to the trading post on the edge of our border."
"I will teach you our language. That way you can tell members of your species what we wish to trade for."
>It's nice to hear you won't be a burden on the Tribe.
>"Now. We must complete the Ritual to induct you into the Tribe."
>You nod, and tell him you're ready.
>"Very good, Anon."

>Segenam motions for you to come closer, and the two of you sit near the fire.
>He calls out the Wolf standing by the door who brought you here, and he stands over the two of you. Watching.
>"He will bear witness to the ritual. It is necessary."
>Segenam reaches behind him, and grasps a gnarled old stick.
>He waves it around your body, his eyes closed, chanting some strange words in his native tongue.
>He takes hold of your arm, and holds it over the cup of liquid sitting over the heated stone on the fire.
>"Hold still."
>He rakes the stick across your palm, drawing some blood.
>Ow.
>He holds your hand over the cup, and allows some drops of your blood to fall into the cup of liquid.
>He lets go, and you hold your hand. The cut is small, and should heal easily on its own.
>"Anon. Now you must drink."
>He hands you the cup.
>"I would not recommend smelling it."
>You take his advice, breathing through your mouth.
>You bring the cup to your mouth, and take a big gulp.
>You regret it immediately.
>It's the vilest shit you've ever tasted in your whole life.
>You cough and sputter, and the Elder gives a knowing chuckle.
>"Heheheh! Not the most delectable of teas, isn't it?"
>"It is not supposed to be. It is the essence of the forest, and is used in inducting members into the Tribe."
>Segenam says something to the Wolf behind you, and he nods.
>The Wolf leaves the tent, and walks off.
>"That was Matwau. He has witnessed your union into the Tribe."
>He gives a wide grin at you.
>"Welcome to the Twin Paw Clan."
>"Matwau is going back to your camp to retrieve your belongings."
>"For now though, I will show you to your new mate's tent. She has been working hard to make her hut suitable for you."
>The old Wolf stands up with a grunt, and gestures for you to follow him.

>Segenam leads you to a hut near the edge of the village.
>"This is the hut, Anon. Go on in and greet your Mate. She has missed you terribly. I will be going to sleep now."
>You ask him how you'll communicate with her, and he answers:
>"You will be living with her. You can try and teach her some English. She has always been a quick learner."
>That's not really what you meant, but he dismisses you with a wave of the hand, and he walks back to his hut.
>You swallow, then head inside the hut.
>As soon as you enter the hut, you're tackled by a dark gray wall of fluff.
>You lay there pinned, and a familiar muzzle buries itself into your shoulder.
>She sniffs at you, and lets out a happy yip.
>She practically bathes you face with her tongue, spreading her thin, sticky saliva all over your face.
>You greet her, and she lets out another happy yip.
>She gets off of you, sitting on her knees.
>Looking at her, she has a happy grin on her face a mile wide. Her tail is wagging faster than you knew was possible.
>She brings you close, hugging you against her.
>She sighs happily when you wrap your arms around her, getting a whiff of her familiar scent.

>When you let go of each other, you get a look at the hut.
>The hut looks similar to how the Elder's hut looked, but smaller.
>There's a small fire with a flat cooking stone over it, heating the space to a comfortable temperature.
>In one corner is several sacks of what you assume to be either food or various other supplies.
>In another corner is a wooden container with a primitive fishing pole sitting on it. This must be where she stores her fishing supplies.
>On the other side of the hut sits a pile of pelts, along with a sack that appears to be stuffed with feathers. This must be the bed. It looks big enough for the two of you to sleep comfortably together.
>Speaking of which...
>Kanti gently ushers you over to the pelts, and the two of you lay down.
>She removes her tribal clothing, and huffs when she sees you still fully dressed.
>You remove your clothing, stripping everything off and laying it on the ground.
>Kanti seems satisfied, and she pulls you close, snuggling you tight.
>She pulls a large pelt over the two of you, and you relax into her embrace.
>Her arms are wrapped around you, and your head is pushed deep into the floof of her neck.
>She lifts one of her digitigrade legs and sets it down over you.
>Your body is enveloped by her warmth and fur, and her scent fills your nose.
>You don't think you'll be cold ever again.
>After awhile, your can hear Kanti softly breathing. She's asleep.
>You wrap your arms around her sleeping form, and drift off peacefully to sleep.

	EPILOGUE
	TWO YEARS LATER
>Be Anon.
>You were the only human member of the Twin Paw Clan.
>After you had left Human civilization, you had taken to your new role in the Tribe.
>Whenever the Tribe left to trade with Humans, you were there to make sure everything went smoothly, and that both parties left satisfied.
>When you weren't doing that, you spent the day fishing with your mate Kanti. Every day you would return to the village with baskets brimming with fish.
>You had learned through the men at the trading post that while there had been an initial search for you after you seemingly disappeared, it had been called off after a couple weeks.
>You didn't care. The only people you cared about now was Kanti and the Tribe.

>It was a warm summer day.
>You were sitting next to the riverbank with your wolfess wife Kanti.
>The clothes you were wearing were well suited for your new Tribal life.
>Some trousers stitched together from a pelt along with a leather belt to keep it up, a pair of moccasins, and a thin cotton tunic your wife had woven just for you.
>Although you spoke her language now, she preferred to try and speak to you in the English you had taught her.
>She said it gave her a better understanding of you, and she liked the way it rolled off of her tongue.
>It was noon, and the two of you were about to eat the food you had brought with you for lunch.
>Some deer pemmican, nuts and berries from the bushes around you, and even a bit of tea from a jar.
>Your wife spoke up:
>"Anon? I have something to tell you."
>You look up from your meal, and ask her what she has to say.
>"I am with child."
>You choke on your food, and spit out a wad of pemmican onto the ground next to you.
>You're pretty sure you had heard of humans managing to get Anthros pregnant, but it was rare.
>Kanti has a horrified look on her face seeing how you reacted, but you quickly calm her down saying that you were just surprised.
>You lean over and give her a hug, patting her belly.
>Now that you really looked, you could see it was a bit more rounded than usual.
>Her tail starts to wag furiously, and there are tears in her eyes.
>She hugs you back, squeezing you tight.
>"We will raise them strong... They will carry on our names."
>You smiled.
>You would never be cold ever again.
