Reigns over Barren Land [Saber Tooth Tiger; Tribal, Harem, Pregnancy]: Anon is the only male in a tribe of female saber tooth tigers, and his presence alone is enough to put them into heat. Unfortunately, one in particular is not fond of sharing him.

>Man, is he furious
>You are working at the Museum of History and Technology as a temp job
>It’s usually a pretty easy job: pick up trash, hand out maps, yell at kids to get off the displays
>But today the museum director is running all over absolutely steaming
>Most of the museum was shut down for renovations, and the exhibits were taken away for cleaning or repairing
>When the various artifacts and dioramas were returned everything had been put back all wrong
>Some artifacts were thrown onto the floor
>Some statues were blocking doorways
>And then there’s exhibit 27C
>In what was supposed to be a section devoted mostly to dinosaurs, a bunch of other stuff is thrown into the scene so incompetently it had to be done intentionally
>Saber toothed tigers are chasing a stegosaurus
>Some kind of ancient pyramid is sitting on top of a tar pit
>Tribal fetishes and primitive fertility icons are hung on the “sky” that’s supposed to be a nature backdrop for the scene
>Even a life-sized replica of the Rosetta Stone is tossed in there, because why not
>Well, according to one of the movers’ excuses it was done because “it looked like cave drawings”
>”How the hell does this even happen!?” the director says
>Having an answer to that isn’t exactly in your pay grade
>Unfortunately, you need to investigate anyway
>The whole staff is sent around the museum to catalog all the misplaced or missing displays, and you’re in charge of 27C
>You can kind of see the thought process of how all the inaccuracies were made
>The movers clearly grew up with The Flintstones and based their arrangement off of the show
>You’re examining the exhibit with clipboard in hand noting everything wrong about it
>When you duck behind the pyramid your heart stops
>Holy shit, is that a bomb!?
>There’s a small, box-like device humming and vibrating on the floor
>You then notice the gyros on top, realizing it must be from the Technology wing
>But that’s all the way on the other side of the museum
>Those were some pretty dumb movers
>The director deliberately said not to touch anything “unless you absolutely have to”, but it’s just going to drain electricity or overheat if you don’t unplug it
>When you approach it, the gyros start spinning wildly
>The whole device lifts off the ground
>A white flash of light like an old camera goes off, and you pass out

>You awaken to the sound of insects buzzing, lying under the shade of enormous leaves
>There’s a pool of murky water nearby with a pair of strange, goofy looking creatures eating the flora around it
>Wait, are those...dinosaurs?
>You don’t know exactly what kind you’re looking at, but with your mind on dinos just moments ago they can’t be anything else
>Outside of the overgrowth are rolling hills and scattered vegetation
>Ancient wildlife everywhere
>Did you just go back in time?
>The dinos squeal in pain, and you see large spears sticking out of them
>You spin around, trying to see where the attack came from
>From out of the shrubbery creeps a burly feline with massive fangs
>A saber toothed tiger
>Walking on two legs?
>And obviously female
>Spear in hand, wearing a leather loincloth and a band around her furry breasts
>Jewelry adorns her body, and her head it topped with a feathered headdress
>Her muscular physique shows even through her dusty pelt
>There’s a predatory, yet inquisitive look in her eyes as she stands guard with her spear aimed at you
>You don’t think you could outrun her (or her weapon), so you stare her down hoping to buy a few extra seconds
>That’s exactly what she wants
>By the time you sense the others behind you, you’re already on the ground tangled in a net
>Four more of the felines, all female, dare you to make a move
>”What is this thing, Nassial?” one of the says
>Now they’re talking in your language?
>They make room for the one you confronted first, Nassial
>She looms over you, blocking out the sun
>”Should we kill it?” one of the others says
>”Wait,” both you and Nassial say in unison
>They all jump back in surprise
>”Now it’s talking? In OUR tongue?”
>They look to Nassial for command, or some sort of answer
>”What ARE you?” the leader says
>The way her question rumbles is even more threatening than the dinosaurs and the other sabers with their spears combined
>Human, you try explaining
>”Are there any others like you nearby?”
>Yes?
>Maybe?
>You don’t even know where you are right now
>”Hmph. We’ll bring it back with us,” Nassial says
>You’re carried off in the net like a hammock by the four who trapped you, with Nassial following in the rear to keep an eye on you
>Any time you look at her you see an unblinking stare
>Any time you look at any of the others for too long, she growls at you
>You’re better off just closing your eyes for the trip

>You take a peek when you hear the commotion of civilization
>Oh look, it’s a whole lush village filled with buildings shaped like pyramids
>The pieces are coming together now, no matter how mismatched they still are
>It doesn’t take long before you notice something about the sabers milling about
>Young or old, there’s nothing but females here
>They stare at you in awe as you are carried through their village and up the main stairs of the biggest structure
>Inside looks like a gathering hall, with a pile of leathers stacked high on stone steps in the far end
>Sitting on top is an aged saber with a sagging hide, one chipped fang and the other gone completely
>Unlike the others, she doesn’t react much to the sight of you
>”What have you brought today, Nassial?” she says
>”It calls itself a ‘human’,” the leader says
>The sage blinks
>”Interesting...”
>You are unrolled by your captors, though they keep the net held up as though it were a fence keeping you from running away
>The sage hobbles over and feels your clothes
>”So soft,” she says. “I would hate to destroy such craftsmanship. Would you mind removing them for us?”
>What, now? In front of all these women?
>They’re not human women, but still...
>”Take them off, or I’ll TEAR them off with any flesh I grab as well,” Nassial says
>You hesitantly strip down to nothing
>Thankfully, they’re more interested in you than judgmental
>You cover yourself reflexively, but the sage just brushes you hands away like moving a leaf from her path
>”Male,” she says
>There’s murmuring from the others
>”Do you know what he is?” Nassial asks
>”He’s a human,” the sage says as though she came to the conclusion herself. “Male human, yes. Perhaps a gift from the Fang Mother.”
>Nassial scoffs
>”He’s not even one of us, though. What use do we have for such a ‘gift’?”
>The sage shrugs
>”Take him along on your hunts. Maybe his role among us will be clear then.”
>You see the gears working in Nassial’s eyes
>”Fine,” she responds. “Tomorrow he comes with us. Tonight he sleeps outside, with the night guard.”
>You’re given a matted blanket to sleep on, along with some cooked (dino?) meat
>Sleeping with so many eyes on you is troublesome at first, but is also a little comforting
>As long as you’re not being used as bait, no harm will come to you
>Right?
>Right?
>Does anyone back home even know you’re gone?

>You’re roused from sleep by the leader, Nassial
>The saber tooth you learn is the leader of the ENTIRE tribe, and not the worldly sage
>The night was cool, but you can already tell the day will be a hot one
>You strip down to your underwear and take a rather dilapidated spear with you
>”You stay in the front,” Nassial orders, “so we can keep you from running off, and to see your hunting prowess.”
>Which isn’t that great
>Whether it’s the shape of the spear or the thick plates of the dinos, you can’t seem to make any successful strike against them
>Sometimes they flee before you can even lift your weapon
>Any mistakes you make are met with snarling and the sabers charging in to fix things
>Nassial isn’t too happy
>”You may be better off making clothes, or sweeping the streets,” she growls
>But you’re given one final chance to redeem yourself
>There’s a few more of the goofy looking things milling about, though these at least have some fairly nasty looking spikes on them
>Before you can make the first move, however, Nassial grabs your shoulder
>”Hold it. Watch.”
>Well, you can feel and hear it before anything else
>A goddamn Tyrannosaurus rex
>Just as intimidating as you’d imagine
>It attacks the docile dinosaurs, trying to pick them off one at a time
>Some of its prey fights back, getting a few good blows in before being killed
>”Let them wear it down, and then we move in.”
>You nod and stay attentive
>When Nassial takes her hand off your shoulder, you hear a faint sniffing from her
>Great, now you’re self-conscious about your sweaty odor
>The T-rex begins ripping apart its prey, but it doesn’t get too far before the sabers launch in for the ambush
>Between the beast’s fatigue and the deadly precision of the women, it’s slain in a flurry of spears
>”What a catch!” Nassial says triumphantly
>Two of the others run back to the village to get help transporting their game back
>With more sabers on hand, the T-rex and its prey are then stripped, cut up, and hauled back in chunks

>The whole village seems to be in better humor when the hunting party returns with its trophies
>You didn’t really do much to contribute, but Nassial doesn’t harass you about it
>”Hold it, let me check for wounds,” she says, steering you into a private chamber
>You didn’t get hurt much (or at all, really) except for a bit of your pride
>Once inside, she’s at your back spreading her paw pads all over as though combing through fur you don’t have
>She grabs your head to keep you looking forward, and you can feel the breathing of her snout up against your skin
>The rumble of Nassial’s lungs is audible as she heaves in and out
>You offer no resistance, and your arm is soon hoisted over your head
>She isn’t even trying to be discreet any longer
>Her nose buries into your underarm and she inhales deeply
>For the longest time you’re standing still with the saber tooth hyperventilating behind you
>”Stay there!” she barks
>You don't need to be told twice
>She leaves you alone, but returns in less than a minute
>You hear the sloshing of water moments before being drenched by a clay jar
>”They can’t...know your scent...too strong...for safety,” she mutters incoherently
>You’re “fur dried” with her paws, and then her whole body, before you’re allowed back outside
>The village accepts you into their evening feast, indulging in the spoils of the hunt
>There’s music, dancing, and bonfires
>No amount of activity is enough to distract Nassial
>Her eyes stay on you for the entire night, and even when you lie down to sleep

>The next day follows a similar hunting pattern, albeit with a darker, ominous sky
>Your technique hasn’t improved much, but Nassial is more encouraging
>To you, anyway
>To the others, she’s much more impatient and critical
>”What has gotten you so agitated?” one of the others says
>She almost takes a spear shaft to the face from her comment
>But Nassial is distracted without a doubt
>Her wide battle stance from the last two days is replaced with knees touching and thighs rubbing together 
>By midday, sweat is dripping from you thanks to the humidity
>A booming is heard not too far in the distance
>”Thank the Fang Mother,” Nassial mutters under her breath
>The hunt is called early, and you return to the village just before the downpour
>Without saying a word, Nassial pulls you up the stairs to an abode almost as high up as the gathering hall
>Hers
>There’s a glazed look in her eyes, and NOW you see the same predatory stance as when you first squared off against her in
>”Y-you did this to me,” she huffs
>”Our men have all gone...slain, sick...months ago. Now YOU show up, and I can’t stop this crippling heat. I can’t see clearly. I can’t...think.”
>She grabs you and pins you down atop a stack of leathers
>”Take it off,” she says
>You can’t exactly move your arms much the way they are, but you make an earnest effort to reach your waist
>”No, MINE!” she hisses
>You can’t reach her loincloth either, so you tentatively grab her breast wrap
>You have just enough wingspan to untie her
>The strip of fabric flops to your chest as her breasts dangle free, her nipples poking through her coat
>She lets go of you but places her paws opposite your head, nodding slowly with her eyes shut
>You cup her breasts and rub your thumbs over the aroused teats
>Her mouth unhinges and her drool splatters around you
>You never realized just how far a saber tooth’s mouth can even open
>”N-now...you.”
>You roll your underwear down as far as you can while on your back, just enough to give her what she needs
>Her hips lift up and position themselves for the inevitable
>You’ve been too busy focusing on the sabers’ teeth and weapons to fully absorb how little those loincloths actually cover
>She’s completely exposed, and the heat from her engorged lips pours over you as she eases her weight down
>She takes your length little by little, whether out of unfamiliar strain or savoring each bit at a time
>Her muscles are visibly flexed as she works her way around you
>The huntress, the leader, the sword-fanged beast...
>Mewling and shuddering by the time your hips touch
>She’s frozen on you, feeling your pulse as she relishes the moment
>”T-thank the Fang Mother,” she gasps.
>Like a piston, her gyrating is slow to start before rapidly building up speed
>It’s not long already before your pelvis aches from her fervent humping
>For such a sexually starved creature, her stamina is impressive
>She’s either aware of your discomfort, or begging for you to take control
>But in any case, it’s time for her to switch positions
>Without disconnecting, you are flipped to your feet while she rolls onto her back
>Too fast for you to grasp what even happened
>Her rump is in the air and her legs hook around your waist
>She’s got core strength, no doubt
>As you resume thrusting, you find yourself leaning forward a little too much
>You grab a hold of the only support you can find
>Her fangs
>”C-careful!” she snaps. “They’re not made of stone!”
>You try your best not to put too much pressure on her teeth, but you’re also concerned about trying not to finish too soon and risk her fury
>That, however, seems the opposite of her wishes
>”Rrrragghhh, give IN already! You are MY quarry, and I will drain you dry!”
>Now holding back is no longer a matter of life or death
>It’s probably just death if you do
>Your escalating climax is reached and unloaded with one last pump
>As you splash her insides, the saber tooth lets out a silent roar
>Her throat muscles contract, but she is too enervated to do anything but pant
>You slowly pull yourself out of her, suddenly feeling the chill of the rainy air without her heat around you
>But her legs clench tighter as you try to move away
>”Not yet...you’re not finished...until I say so.”
>With a jerk Nassial pulls you on top of her, one arm grappling you to her bosom while her other paw cups your groin
>”We must take advantage of the rains. They won’t hear us like this, and I will not let you go until the seed has taken hold.”
>That doesn’t sound good

>Nassial becomes highly possessive of you over the following weeks
>You’re not allowed out of her sight, and you’re not allowed to go into the danger of the hunts with her either
>She mates with you frequently, sometimes with the rains masking your noises and sometimes out in the vegetation when privacy is scarcer
>Her forcefulness drops off a bit from the first night
>In fact, some nights are spent in her arms with her claws making red marks on your chest, as if she’s squeezing a loved toy
>It doesn’t take long before the other women grow suspicious
>They sniff the air around the two of you, but it’s less about your post-sex aroma and more about the subtle changes from Nassial’s fertility
>Then the changes become impossible to ignore
>Nassial’s appetite intensifies, and the definition of her abdominal muscles is concealed by the growing swell of her belly
>There is a village meeting before the sage, and the other women finally confront their leader
>”Nassial carries a litter within her!” they shout
>Nassial is clearly searching for a way to challenge the accusation, but her paw instinctively touches her stomach
>”Is this true?” the sage says
>”It’s as you said,” Nassial growls, “the human is a blessing from the Fang Mother.”
>”A blessing for the whole tribe!” one of the others cries
>”He is MY prize, and the tribe’s lineage will pass on because of it!”	
>”Then perhaps it’s time for a change in leadership!”
>The women advance forward, but Nassial grabs a spear and repels them
>”You would betray your ruler? You would kill her unborn cubs? You would waste YOUR lives just for the CHANCE to overthrow me?”
>”THAT’S ENOUGH,” the sage roars
>Her age and weathered look have not quelled her spirit
>”I do believe the Fang Mother has given Anon as a gift for us all, but also as a test of our tribe’s unity. If you strike out against one another, the Fang Mother will curse you all.”
>There is a hush over the whole village
>The sage’s words are less of a warning and more of a guarantee
>”Nassial...” the sage says, back to her soft-spoken nature,” I urge you to reconsider. Until we find more males out there we need Anon to ensure the safety of our tribe.”
>The anger is gone from the other sabers, and the women just look to their leader plaintively.
>Nassial sighs
>She looks back to the sage hoping to see her support, but the elder saber is unyielding
>”Fine, he will mate with the rest of the tribe for its survival.”
>The tension dissipates
>A few walk forward only to be stopped once more by Nassial’s spear
>”But as your leader, I will control who mates with him. You will copulate with MY approval, and only as long as I deem necessary. At night, he will bed with ME and me alone.”
>One step is all she needs to push the whole crowd back in fear
>”Should I catch anyone attempting to usurp Anon or my authority, I shall break her legs and leave her for the raptors. AM I UNDERSTOOD?”
>Silent nodding, even from the sage
>Guess you’re not getting a say in this

>The fate of being a breeding slave comes with being venerated as a savior of sorts
>Both you and Nassial are catered to each day, especially as an attempt to win her favor
>Nassial oversees all potential mates for you, going so far as to sometimes watch the deed being done
>The women don’t have the same kind of performance anxiety it seems, likely unabashed in their raging lust
>But Nassial actually considers your condition most times
>Like if you are too raw or tired, she prohibits mating until you’re ready
>Even then, she “urges” you to conserve some energy for her own lovemaking needs at night
>Young, hopeful, and rejected sabers are sent out to hunt for greater quantities of food to feed the increasing appetite of those selected for reproduction
>This in turn improves the overall strength and hunting skill of the tribe, as the warriors hope to someday become the coveted chosen ones
>After months, you see your labor pay off
>Over a third of the women around the village cradle their gravid bellies containing your progeny
>They look to you with delight, stroking the gift you’ve given and reminding you of each night you were allowed to share with them
>Most of the women continue to hunt until they become too large, then they help out with other chores
>Even Nassial hangs her spear for the time being when her expansion proves too cumbersome
>However, she hasn’t lost her warrior’s might as she prepares new homes for the tribe
>Despite her warnings, some unapproved or heat-possessed women try to entice you while their leader is preoccupied
>Not wanting to share in the wrath, you hold them off long enough for Nassial to catch the disobedience
>At the same time, the leader’s threats are never truly carried out apart from verbal reprimands and a few swipes from her paws
>It seems her maternal temperament is making her more forgiving
>It also helps that the tribe becomes more self-governing, and any women who “cut in line” are punished by the others
>Regardless, the approved mates still try to impress you and outshine each other
>But something about Nassial, whether it’s her dominance or her confidence, makes her your only true queen

>You’ve since accepted this as your new home
>There’s little chance you’ll see your own world again, but this new one ensures you’ll be taken good care of
>Nassial’s pregnancy turns her from an aggressive ruler to a motherly caretaker
>At least to a certain extent
>It helps that she feels honor (and a little smugness) for being your first, the farthest one along in her growth, and will very likely hold the record for being the biggest
>Her hunger alone is a testament to this
>A pile of fruit cores and discarded dino ribs are stacked up in the aftermath of her feasting
>But no amount of girth keeps her from her commanding duties, or douses her heat and desire
>It’s raining heavily one night when you’re in bed with her, after being thoroughly drained yet again 
>Almost your whole body is curled around her enormous belly
>She guides your hands as you feel for life within her
>”Mine will be the strongest,” she reminds you.
>You could have guessed that from the dozens of spears and knives she already has stockpiled for her cubs
>”Our tribe will grow with unmatched warriors, but OUR kin will reign over these lands.”
>Kissing proves to be a little awkward with her sword-like canines
>She instead shows her affection by nuzzling your head and massaging you with her soft, leathery paw pads
>Your hands are forced back by the roiling of life in her womb
>”See? Strong already!”
>The wind howls through the village, whistling as it passes by
>Nassial pulls you closer for security, and even her cubs calm down
>”And when they’re born, we will prepare for the next litter. With any luck, the Fang Mother will bless us with these rains again when the time comes.”
