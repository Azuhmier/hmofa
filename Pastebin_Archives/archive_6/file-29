Ladies' Night [Various; Crossover, Meta, Secret Green, Comfy]: A casual gathering of all the lovely ladies from my pastes in one very self-indulgent bit of wankery. If you can identify them all (excluding the one who has yet to have her own story), then thank you immensely for reading my material!

>She’s still following you
>A young woman has been stalking you for the last several blocks
>She’s actually pretty stunning, but such a beauty has to have some kind of ulterior motive for tailing YOU of all people
>Maybe she’s trying to proposition you?
>Well, that’s being hopeful
>She’s more likely to be scoping you out for a mugger
>You’re so absorbed in your runaway thoughts you don’t even realize you’re heading into an alley
>A dead end
>When you turn around she’s right on you, grinning wickedly
>With every step she takes, it looks like a part of her drips off her body 
>Her smile melts, literally
>As does the rest of her body
>What was once a beautiful woman is now...
>Well, a dog woman
>A beautiful dog woman
>A two-legged, black-furred canine with all the accessories you’d expect from a devil: horns, fangs, wings, a spaded tail...
>All nearly bursting out of the skimpiest outfit you can hardly see through her fur
>A beautiful, succubus dog woman
>A hellhound
>”You’re looking a little lonely, big guy,” she coos, running a thick claw under your chin
>She’s going to take your soul, isn’t she?
>The hellhound actually just giggles at your fear
>”Oh no, I don’t do that anymore. I don’t take souls, I take commissions. My NEW employer does things a little differently.”
>She pulls a business card out of her ballooning cleavage
>[Medafet’s Matchmaking]
>There’s an address on the card, and it’s someplace not far off
>”Just give me a call when you find some happiness. I’d REALLY like to hear your feedback. Toodles!”
>And the hellhound is gone in a puff of smoke
>...What just happened?

>You head to the address on the card come nighttime
>It’s a trap if you’ve ever seen one
>There’s no office or business building you’d expect from some kind of formal “service” being offered
>It’s just a dive bar
>One without signage or even windows
>Of course such an observation is superficial compared to the bouncer at the door
>It’s another anthropomorphic animal woman
>This one’s a wild, punkish looking hyena
>Or at least she LOOKS like a hyena, except maybe a little more…monstrous
>Leaning on the butt of a really big fucking gun
>Not a bad bouncer to have for your bar
>”Go on in, love!” she laughs as you approach. “It’s Ladies’ Night, and I’m sure you’ll find someone to hold you tight if you ask REEEAL polite like!”
>She continues cackling at her own joke as she steps aside for you to enter
>Welp, here goes nothing...
>When you head inside, you’re awestruck
>Not by the bar itself, though; it’s pretty unremarkable
>All the patrons are animal people, and all female from what you can tell
>There’s a number of different species, though quite a lot of canines
>Closest to you is what you’d call the “wolfess table”
>Two gray ones, a russet one, and one darker than all the others
>The darkest wolfess, dressed like some kind of heavy metal fan, is in the middle of a story
>”So I climbed his back, tied the ears on two of his heads to each other, and put the third in a headlock! Slammed the oaf into the ground and made a nice little outline of his body in the ground!”
>”W0w, that s0unds like a g00d Father’s Day, V0lfa,” the russet wolfess says in a somewhat robotic tone
>She has a vicious looking chrome arm with literal blades for fingers
>Doesn’t make it easy for her to pick up her glass, which makes a screeching noise with every attempt
>The one named Volfa throws back a few shots, and her mouth starts smoking
>”Hey, you ever arm wrestle with that thing?”
>”Just 0nce. I w0n.”
>The dark wolfess drops her elbow onto the table
>”Alright, you and me! Hell, I’ll even take HER on at the same time!”
>One of the two gray wolves—heavily scarred and heavily armored—scoffs
>”Hmph. Arrogant pup. Fine, I will take your challenge and show you some humility.”
>”That’a girl!”
>Volfa has a wolfess in each paw and nods to the fourth one
>The other gray is half inside what looks like a mascot costume, like she just got off the clock from her job
>”Thanks, but I’ll watch,” she says. “I don’t think there’s much room left, unless you want me to arm wrestle your toes beneath the table. Then I’d be the real ‘underdog’!”
>She elbows the scarred wolfess, who doesn’t look amused
>”Get it? ‘Under-dog’! Not to be confused with ‘Updog’.”
>”Wh0’s Upd0g?”
>”Dammit, R0uga, you ruined the joke...”
>The wolfess table commences their three-way test of strength as you examine the rest of the bar
>While the dogs have a few tables to themselves, the bar counter is packed with felines
>There’s a jaguar in tribal clothes batting a shot glass side to side, like it were a small rodent or a ball of yarn
>Behind the counter is a lioness dressed up in a medieval wench’s outfit
>”Welcome to the finest tavern in ye olde lands…or whatever,” she says dully to the other cats. “What are you having?”
>The first one to order is a tiger who’s trying hard to adjust her ill-fitting swimsuit as she looks at the menu
>This place doesn’t seem to have a very strict dress code
>”Just water, please,” the tigress says
>The lioness sighs and turns to another large cat
>You think it’s just a second lion, dressed in tribal garb like the jaguar, but this one has enormous protruding fangs like a saber tooth tiger
>What also protrudes from her is a massive pregnant belly
>”Water will do,” she grunts, rubbing the top of her gravid swell. “Best to drink the clean rains so long as the brood is still growing.”
>The lioness turns to yet another patron with a groan
>”Please don’t say ‘water’.”
>The last feline’s even stranger than the saber tooth
>She LOOKS like another lioness, but has scaly patches on her body and a black, snake-like tail
>A…sphinx?
>No, a manticore
>”I’ll have something mixed,” she says with a toothy grin
>”You should do a body shot!” the tigress says, almost popping out of her swimsuit
>”Are you offering?” the lioness bartender asks
>”Hmmm, I’ll do the funnel instead!” the manticore says
>The saber tooth, despite her fecundity, hefts the manticore onto the bar counter
>The lioness props the manticore’s mouth open with a funnel and grabs several bottles in preparation
>You’re mildly invested in the show, but then again there’s still more to see around the place
>Along the wall is a line of flashing arcade machines, with a kangaroo girl tapping the buttons frantically
>You can faintly see a rather familiar blue vixen fighting with a staff on the screen
>The game freezes for a moment and the kangaroo squeals in panic
>Surprising you very little, another canine…ish creature with a vibrant yellow mane walks over
> She casually punches the machine with her staticky paw
>The arcade cabinet pops with electricity and the game resumes
>”Thanks, Juitz,” the kangaroo says without taking her eyes off the screen
>”I got your back, ‘roo,” the spark dog says. “Can I play next?”
>”Uh…yeah, sure. Just…let me…finish this one….”
>The dog leans against one of the cabinets to wait, and the whole line of them glitch to show “JTZ” for every spot on the “High Scores” list
>”Uh, maybe you could be Player 2?” the kangaroo offers
>”Right. I’ll go get the coins.”
>”W-wait, Juitz, you can just do that…”
>Too late, the spark dog’s already off to bother the bartender for game tokens
>Hidden in the corner at a smaller table are even more dogs
>A nondescript one just sulks and mumbles to herself about everything going on in the bar
>Luckily you’re spared from her judgmental gaze
>In fact, she doesn’t seem to notice you at all
>The other one joining her, clearly a German shepherd, only pretends like she’s listening to the grumbling
>It doesn’t seem like she’s ignoring the conversation out of boredom, though
>Rather, her paws are too busy “exploring” regions underneath the table
>She’s fidgeting discreetly
>You imagine she’s trying to do something lewd and not get caught, yet deliberately doing it for the thrill of that very risk
>It makes you think of your own love life
>Or lack thereof
>You just sort of wandered into this place, following the mysterious lead of something completely unbelievable to you
>All of these anthro ladies with different personalities and histories
>They’re all here for a reason
>Though it’s probably just to have a good time
>And yet, they all seem…”taken”
>Like there’s already someone in their lives you can’t compete with
>Is there someone in this place just for YOU, like the hellhound hinted at?
>Well, there’s still the stairs leading to the floor above…

>The raucous activity from the bar below peters out to quietness upstairs
>There are several rooms along a narrow hallway, each used for a different reason
>The first one appears to be just a simple lounge
>A white wolfess—�very similar looking to the “Volfa” downstairs—�is enthralled with a nature documentary about wolves on a small TV
>You guess she’s not so interested in the wolves themselves as she is the rugged animal handler playing with them
>There’s a washroom not far off, with the door slightly ajar
>Most of the ladies here look like they could rip your neck from under your head with just a swipe, but you can’t resist taking a peek
>There’s a lighter gray wolfess dressing herself in hunting apparel while someone else is in the bathtub singing
>”Hilde, we’re going to be late for the party,” the hunter wolfess says. “Hurry up or I’m coming in there and finishing the job for you!”
>“~Just a moment!~” the one in the tub sings
>Although the plastic screen hides the bather, the pointed ears of the silhouette make you think she’s probably a jackal or something
>The hunter wolfess seems to have an epiphany right at the same time.
>”Jackal…Hilde…hey, Hilde, what’s that ‘power’ you keep going on about?”
>You back away from the door, just in case they’re ready to come out at a moment’s notice
>You’re starting to run out of rooms to check
>There’s a large bedroom with several more anthro girls in it
>One enormous Kodiak bear is taking up the entire bed
>She looks like she’s out cold, and that almost nothing is going to wake her for a while
>There’s a snow leopard snoozing on top of the ursine like she were a mattress
>She tosses and turns to get comfortable, proving the bear is way too catatonic to be bothered by it
>A teal and gold kingfisher is sleeping upright in the corner under a hut—or a nest—of curtains
>Finally, there’s a hyena (a real one this time) cocooned in a pile of blankets in the corner
>She’s shivering slightly, as though her overabundance of blankets still isn’t enough to keep her warm
>You leave the napping girls and head to the final room
>If this one doesn’t have an anthro girl waiting for you, then it’ll all be for nothing
>You step through the threshold with eyes half shut in anticipation
>When you’re completely inside, you see what you expected the most:
>It’s empty
>You don’t know what you were hoping for, but there isn’t even a single being in here beside you, anthro or otherwise
>Still, there’s a pretty nice bed
>If nothing else, maybe you can crash here for the night while you figure out what to do with yourself
>As you flop on your back, your head back up in surprise
>Closing the door is what you think must be another wolfess, but she’s so large and full of fluff she has to have some bear in her
>Honestly, you don’t know what kind of animal to think of her as
>Except maybe “comforting”
>Silvery fur and deep blue eyes
>Powerful limbs, but an alluring softness
>All packaged in a simple dress and apron
>You sit upright, only to have the anthro woman gently push you back down
>”You seem surprised,” she muses with a soothing voice
>Yeah, a little bit
>You weren’t expecting anyone to notice you
>You can’t think of a single moment in this bar where you felt like you belonged
>Almost nobody made eye contact with you (except the hellhound and the bouncer) and they acted as though you weren’t even physically here
>”Don’t feel bad,” she responds. “I’m sure they would enjoy your company, but they have eyes for only one human of their own already.”
>So it was pointless to come here, then
>…Unless…
>You look into her prismatic eyes, and she gives you a friendly smile
>”This is my inn. I give everyone a chance to be happy and relax, human and anthro alike. I can’t say I’m the one you’re looking for in your quest for companionship, but I CAN give you a moment of comfort before you go looking again.”
>The innkeeper sets her apron aside and eases herself onto the bed with you
>You’re pulled up against her, nestled into her large body
>”When you’re ready to leave, you may. Until then, be at peace.”
>She wraps one arm under you, and curls the other over you
>You can immediately feel the warmth of her body
>The warmth of her plush coat
>The warmth of her caring sweetness
>She completely envelops you in fur and tenderness
>One large paw holds you tight while the other rubs slow circles on your chest
>”You will be loved,” she assures you
>Her voice reverberates through the contact between your bodies, loosening any tension and relaxing your very muscles
>Her breathing is slow; her fluffy form presses up against you with even more softness as she inhales deeply
>When she exhales it’s a gradual, gentle hum in your ear
>”You will find your happiness.”
>You can feel the heat of her breath flow over any part of you not already blanketed in her fur
>Her mantra instills good feelings in you
>And any time your mind dares stray toward cloudy thoughts, she squeezes the negativity out of you
>You wonder how long she’ll let you stay here
>You’re answered with another firm hug
>”Don’t feel pressured to leave,” she whispers. “You’ll know when the time is right, but you’ll also know when you need to…just…rest…”
>She hefts you off the mattress just enough so she can rock you in her arms
>Repeating herself after every breath and every rock
>”You will be loved.”
>”You will find your happiness.”
>Now you’re up on her stomach
>Her neck is your pillow
>Her arms are your blankets
>You rise and fall in time with her breathing, like a gentle wave
>And much like the rise and fall of the sun, she rolls over and places you down on the opposite side
>She resumes her delicate words
>”Loved.”
>”Happiness.”
>Brushing a paw against your face and leaning her head on top of yours
>Your mind stays awake so you can enjoy the rest of the experience, but your body has already gone to sleep
>”You will find someone who can take care of you like this,” she promises. “Keep your heart open. Someone out there wants to feel just as safe in it.”
>It’s been ages since you’ve been able to hear any of the commotion downstairs, and now you can hardly even make out the words the innkeeper says to you
>But even though the words are intelligible, the messages are clear
>She doesn’t know you personally, but you get the feeling she knows what you’re going through
>She relieves you from your momentary stressors, but she doesn’t quite coddle you from reality
>Encouragements, praises, compliments
>Everything she says to you rings true
>But she’s not doing this to flatter you
>She’s doing this to remind you what you should look for in yourself
>”You are perfect just as you are…” you can hear her say as your eyelids grow heavy
>Something in you knows that when you wake up, this place will be gone
>But it’s because you’ll be ready to leave
>Because it’s for the best
>Because…
>You are perfect
>”Don’t ever change.”
