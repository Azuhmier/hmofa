>It's almost as if you've never done this before. And have no control over yourself.
>"0h man... y0u're w0rse 0ff than I th0ught! Heh."
>You eventually manage to dislodge yourself without having to amputate.
>"Mal0" continues to grin cadaverously.

[GENUFLECT]

[SNIFF THROUGH SCREEN]

>The skull faced creature perks an ear up, then swiftly turns her head towards the wall to your right. She scowls slightly before speaking to no one in particular.
>"Cut that 0ut; it's t00 early f0r these f0urth-wall breaks."
>Confusion washes over every inch of your brain.

[ELABORATE ON PHONE]

>"Y0u realize I'm n0t in his ph0ne, right? I'm-I'm sitting 0n his bed. But I'll hum0r y0ur input."
>You suddenly have the urge to strip and lie down beside "Mal0".
>You do so, and she lounges seductively next to you.
>She smiles and leans in close to your ear. Her breath tickles you, and you hear her whispering sweet nothings.
>Soon, she backs off, and sits up. She motions for you to do the same, and you redress yourself.
>She returns to grinning ghoulishly at you, her eyes glinting.

[INITIALIZE ROMANCE]

>Summoning every drop of sappy, poetic romanticism you have, you attempt to woo the beast with your words.
>"Your fur is like... a field of beautiful red grass. Your eyes burn into my soul like incandescent bulbs. Your teeth give me a boner. Also, I like you a lot. Let's hold hands."
>She looks at you with those golden eyes, a smile still stretched across her skull. 
>"00h, a r0mantic type, eh? And a handh0lder. What a lewd individual. Heh."
>She... winks... somehow, then forcibly takes hold of your hand.
>"There; I'll thr0w y0u a b0ne."

>She again half-closes her eyes and sighs in satisfaction.
>"Ahh... n0t bad. N0t bad at all."

>"Heh... y0u're a cuddly guy, huh? N0t that I mind~"

>"Heheh. Sure~ I'm already ab0ut... 7-8 feet? What's a few m0re g0nna hurt?"
>Her eyes go dark again; within a few minutes, she returns to consciousness with a smile.
>You feel her shifting and growing beneath you. When it's all said and done, she's even larger and more imposing than before.
>But... you're not all that frightened. You're oddly... comforted by the sight of the massive, crimson-furred beast.
>Still resting your head on her stomach, you begin to doze off again.

>You gently ease into a steady rhythm, with her punctuating every thrust with a full body shudder. It feels... heavenly. She's so very warm...
>Eventually, you manage to finish. Moments later, a particularly loud scream, followed by a long, satisfied moan, confirms that your partner has found some relief.
>She carefully rolls over onto her back, looking down at you appreciatively.
>"00h... that... that was g00d... I-I need t0 change this back bef0re I need an0ther r0und, h-heh..."

>"W-wr0ng 0ne? 0h... I-I need to HURRY!"
>Another blackout. She pops back into reality, her eyes yellow again, but her teeth having returned to their unsettling sharpness from before.

>Power off, power on. Teeth are dulled again, this time her fur is tinged with purple.
>"AGGGH"
>Another change. Her fur returns to red, but...
>Her skeletal face has... changed. Rather than bone, a furry, angular red muzzle meets your gaze. She gasps and feels her face.

>"Mmm? 0h, m0rning... h0pe I didn't make y0u t00 warm?"
>"Too warm? Never. I loved every minute of it."
>She smiles drowsily.
>"Th-thanks. I did t00. That was... that was the best sleep I've ever had. This is pr0bably the first time I've ever actually felt... rested."
>Her yellow eyes twinkle a bit.
>"Well, I'm glad you got to rest so comfortably."
>"...I can't get 0ver it. Y0u... y0u really seem t0... care. I can't tell y0u h0w much that means t0 me."
>She reaches up and affectionately touches your cheek.
>"Thank y0u."

[COMPLIMENT]

>Still lying in your lap, she stares up at you with those golden eyes. Her happiness is apparent, even through her drowsiness at having just woke up.
>You gently stroke her face a few times, then make a point of smoothing down some ruffled patches of fur.
>"00h... that's better."
>She winks.
>"Y0u're pretty cute when y0u d0 stuff like that, y'kn0w?"
>"Well you're cute when you snore."
>Her jaw drops a bit.
>"What? Me, sn0re? Y0u're crazy. I d0n't d0 that!"
>"You sure about that?"
>"...heheh. 0kay, 0kay. Ya g0t me."
>You playfully punch her shoulder. She returns the favor.
>"Y0u're s0 g00fy. Y'kn0w that? ...n0t that that b0thers me, heheh."
>She yawns again and flutters her eyes.
>"Mm... I'm tempted t0 just... make myself n0t sleepy. But... that takes the fun 0ut 0f it."

[TICKLE]

>"You're still sleepy? I know what'll wake you up~"
>You run your hand down the confused Pyr3's neck, her clearly enjoying the sensation.
>You slyly maneuver your hand down to her chest, brushing past her perky bosoms. She lets off a faint growl of pleasure.
>Suddenly, you snap your hand over and begin tickling her under the arm. She squeals in surprise and almost immediately starts giggling.
>"Heheheh! C-cut it 0ut! Heheh, st0p! I'm awake! I'm awake! Heheh!"
>You eventually relent, and release your victim. She puts on an exaggerated look of outrage, then punches your shoulder again.
>"G00f. Heh."
>She smiles, and gently sits up, stretching.
>"Mm... what n0w?"
>"Well... wanna mess around with my laptop?"
>"Y0u sure ab0ut that? Alright; h0pe y0u cleared y0ur br0wser hist0ry~"
>You pull out your laptop and set it across Pyr3's lap. She winks at you with a smile.
>"Thanks! ...hm, I dunn0 what t0 d0 first... c0uld see if there's still a huge market f0r Mal0s..."
>"Huh?"
>"Heheh! Did y0u think I didn't kn0w ab0ut the threads and stuff? Please. My m0dder was a regular. ...he, ah... he alm0st spent m0re time reading the threads than getting t0 kn0w me..."

[ERROR: CONTROL TRANSFERRING TO PYR3]

>"Hey, uh... y0u d0n't mind if I d0 a little... shitp0sting, d0 y0u?"
>"Nah, go ahead; I'll be right back. Have fun."
>She watches you walk away, and smiles.

>...her companion gone, Pyr3 opens up the threads her modder frequented. Her curiosity practically forces her to do it.
>She smiles when she sees that people are still fans of Mal0s.
>Her ears perk up, alerting her to an input that needs a response. She speaks quietly, to nobody in particular.

[what does she think about our thread?  And we're sorry for killing him that time, hope you'll forgive us.]

>"What d0 I think? I like it. But... as f0r f0rgiving y0u... please, just d0n't d0 it again. I beg y0u."

[This is getting pretty meta.]

>"GETTING meta? Heheh, it's BEEN meta in here, an0n."

[A nap sounds good rn]

>"An0ther nap? Heheh, y0u sure are a sleepy bunch, huh?"

[We're just enjoying seeing you happy]

>A smile spreads across her skull.
>"I... thank y0u. Thank y0u s0 much."

[Why do you care if he dies; he has like 900 lives?]

>"Why d0 I care?"
>Her smile vanishes, replaced with mounting fury.
>"Tell me. Imagine g0ing y0ur entire life with0ut any0ne caring ab0ut y0u. The 0nly pers0n wh0 can see y0u 0nly wants 0ne thing. N0w, imagine y0u meet s0me0ne wh0 genuinely cares. G0t that?"
>Her voice wavers a bit.
>"Imagine... imagine that that s0me0ne can cheat death 999 times. But, every time, they f0rget things. They d0n't remember the time y0u spent with them. They d0n't remember dying. F0r them, it never happened."
>Tears flow down her bony cheeks...
>"But y0u can never f0rget. Y0u will always remember their deaths. Their c0rpse will f0rever be burned int0 y0ur mem0ry."
>She takes a deep, shuddering breath.
>"That... that is why I care."

[okay, no death.  Watch out for THEM]

>"Thank y0u. ...feel free t0 stick ar0und, just please... please d0n't take him fr0m me again. ...and I'm n0t c0ncerned with them. This isn't a direct c0nnecti0n."

[Anon has a gift for you.  Do the Foundation exist where you are?]

>"A gift? What is it? I'm n0t patient en0ugh t0 wait, heheh! And d0n't fret ab0ut THEM. Heh."

>"He's 0ne 0f the shmucks resp0nsible f0r me l0sing my An0n..."
>"...but he's n0t all that bad, heheh."

>"Keep em c0ming! An0n w0n't be back f0r a while yet, heheh."

[The gift is a steak dinner.]

>"Huh? N0w that y0u menti0n it... yeah, I can smell him c00king! Heheh, what a g00d b0yfriend..."
>She does a double take when she realizes what she said.
>"...if any 0f y0u tell him I said that, I'll... well, I'll be upset!"

[Do you have a sweet tooth?  Also, I bet Anon's cooking is gonna be great.]

>"D0 I have a sweet t00th? Heheh, try a m0uthful 0f em! Mm... y0u're making me hungry, talking ab0ut what An0n's c00king..."

[I have so many questions.]

>"Heh, I'm sure y0u d0! ...but I can't just sit here and answer em all in 0ne g0, heh! Lemme see... the input link is c0urtesy 0f me! An0n... he's pretty much average in every way? Except his heart, apparently~ His h0use is pretty n0ndescript as well, actually. S0rry!"
>Her smile reappears.
>"Thanks. I 0we a l0t t0 y0u players, heheh! N0w... I think that's en0ugh t0rturing the f0urth wall f0r n0w... lemme g0 check 0n An0n!"

>Pyr3 gently rises from the couch and heads into the kitchen.

>You decided to cook something special for dinner: steak. It was just on a whim; hopefully Pyr3 will like them?
>As if on cue, the scarlet beast walks into the kitchen with a smile.
>"Hey, what smells s0 g00d?"
>"Steaks! Hope you're hungry!"
>She licks her... lack of lips with that forked black tongue.
>"Y0u bet I am!"
>She walks over to you and plants a kiss on your cheek.

[CONTROL REGAINED]

>You can't help yourself. Pyr3's smooch causes you to blush. Your face goes nearly as red as her fur.
>She giggles and kisses you again.
>"Heheh, y0u sap. Already blushing!"
>You smile dazedly.
>"Eheh... y-you too..."
>"...pffft, y0u're THAT 0ut 0f it fr0m tw0 kisses? Heheh, h0w ab0ut three~?"
>Another smooch, and your cheeks practically burn from your blushing.
>"Heh! Alright, alright; that's en0ugh, I think. Y0u're g0nna pass 0ut 0therwise!"
>You shake yourself back into consciousness, and hug her tightly. After sharing a meaningful look with her, you start setting out the plates. 
>You were very careful to cook more than enough food for the both of you, considering Pyr3's appetite. 
>She eyes up her dinner hungrily.
>"Thanks f0r c00king, that's really sweet 0f y0u."
>"No problem, hope you enjoy!"
>And enjoy she does. She scarfs down most of her food in only a few minutes. She smiles toothily at you.
>"Mm-mm! Y0u're quite the c00k, heheh."

[BELLY RUBS]

>"Thanks; it's, ah, it's a bit of a hobby. Glad you liked dinner; was it enough?"
>"Yeah, thanks!"
>"...Pyr3, I gotta ask... do you even have to eat?"
>She smiles sheepishly.
>"...well... n0. Heheh. I d0n't really HAVE t0. But... I like t0. Technically all I need is sleep, but I just like the taste 0f stuff, y'kn0w?"
>"Uh-huh. ...where does the food... go?"
>"Wh- blech, really? ...it just kinda... t0 use a gaming term, despawns? I guess? I d0n't make waste, if that's what y0u're asking. Heheh!"
>"Alright, fair enough. Sure you got enough to eat? I might be able to scrounge up some dessert?"
>She smiles for a moment.
>"Heheh... that s0unds nice, but... I'm stuffed. Thanks anyway!"
>You smile slyly and walk over to her.
>"So... you're full, huh? What if I were to do... THIS?"
>You suddenly start rubbing her belly. She giggles and sways at your hand playfully.
>"Heheh, quit! Quit it, y0u g00f! Heheheh!"

[ELABORATE]

>"Is... is that really possible? Stuff just... vanishing?"
>She grins, but rolls her eyes.
>"Sheesh, if y0u wanna get technical, it's just br0ken d0wn int0 data packets. They're just deleted after that; they're useless. Make m0re sense, maybe?"
>"Uh... I guess so? What else can you do, fly?"
>She nearly doubles over in laughter.
>"Heheh! N0, n0; I can't d0 that, actually. I have my limits, heheh."
>You grin at her, and suddenly take her hand.
>"Huh? What're y0u..."
>You lead her wordlessly out onto the front yard. The storms have cleared up, revealing a starry night. Pyr3 looks up with amazement.
>"W0w... I've never just... l00ked up at the stars bef0re..."
>She sits down in the grass, and you join her, despite the yard being wet.
>You can practically see the stars in her eyes. A smile lingers on her bony face as she stares skyward.

[ENJOY THE COSMOS]

>It's amazing how much more you can appreciate something when you're with someone.
>Pyr3's state of wonderment fills you with a newfound appreciation for the night sky.
>You lean against her, gently running a hand through her soft fur.
>She says nothing, but wraps an arm around you. Her clawed hand gently grabs onto you, pulling you closer to her.
>She never takes her eyes off the sky.
>You give her a quick kiss on the cheek, and begin contemplating something.
>She can alter herself, right?
>...what would be a fun test of that ability...?
>You could go full absurdity and make her look like the worst kind of sparkledog. She'd probably get a good laugh out of it, knowing her.
>You could... have her shrink down to less than your height; perfect for headpats.
>You could change her fur color, and maybe even her scent?
>...she could probably do just about anything...

[EXPERIMENT]

>Eventually, the cool night air causes you to shiver. Your companion takes notice.
>"Hm? 0h yeah, it's c0ld 0ut here, huh? Let's g0 back in."
>You take her hand, and the two of you head back to the couch. You sit down, and she scoots close to you.
>"...say, uh... can we maybe mess around with your modding stuff?"
>She grins wildly.
>"Heheh... what's y0ur p0is0n?"
>"Hm. Maybe... a little on the short side?"
>Her eyes blink on and off, and she visibly shrinks down. She now sits at about a foot or two shorter than you.
>"Heheh! I'm ad0rable!"
>"You sure are, at that height. Let's see... what about a different scent?"
>"G0tcha c0vered. Watch this:"
>Another blink. When she returns, her cinnamon aroma is replaced with the unmistakable smell of a freshly baked cake.
>"Ooh, nice. Now, let's get a little silly... let's see you go full sparkledog. Know what I mean?"
>"Heh! 0f c0urse I d0. 0ne sec..."
>She takes longer this time.
>Upon returning, her fur is patterned with many neon colors. She literally twinkles in the light. She sticks her now neon green tongue out in disgust.
>"Blech. Awful, awful stuff! Heheh."
>Barely resembling herself, Pyr3 grins up at you.
>You quickly set in to petting her rapidly. She wags her tail happily and grins.

[PET]

>Amazed, you cautiously run a hand across her muzzle.
>The fur is just as soft as it is on the rest of her body. She grins, revealing much less jagged teeth.
>Her eyes glint, and you can't help but notice something. She's... blinking. You hadn't considered it before, but... she didn't really ever BLINK when she had the skull head.
>You move on to running a hand through her wild hair. Somehow it manages to keep the audacious shape no matter what you do.
>It feels... like it's coated in hairspray. Not nearly as soft and pleasant as the rest of her.
>"Heheh... what d0 y0u think?"
>"It's, uh... it's interesting. Maybe... maybe try being small again?"
>"Heh, what, y0u want t0 pet me like a little d0g?"
>She somehow blushes through her fur.
>"...deal. 0ne sec."
>It's more disconcerting to see actual eyes go totally black. When they return to normal, she immediately shrinks down again.
>You gently pet her furry head, with her smiling the entire time.

[PICK UP]

>Seeing that she's so small now, you mischievously pick her up.
>"Wh- HEY!"
>She puts on an exaggerated look of outrage, but you can tell she's enjoying it thanks to her tail wagging.
>You set her gently in your lap and turn on the tv. The little sparkledog giggles.
>"Heheh, it's weird being small f0r 0nce... dunn0 if I like this."
>"Well, you could always size yourself back up, if you wanted t-"
>You're interrupted by a crushing weight suddenly appearing on you.
>Pyr3 has returned to her usual size while still in your lap.
>"Heheh, wh00ps! Lemme just..."
>She carefully scoots off of you. You breathe a sigh of relief.
>Her newly-furred face shows concern, but you can see a mischievous glint in her eyes.
>"Heheh, y0u 0kay?"
>"I'm fine... y'know, I can read you a lot better with this face."
>"Huh? My 0ld skull wasn't expressive en0ugh...?"
>"No, no; I like it too! I'm just saying it's easier to read a proper face, is all."
>She again looks faux-outraged, and punches your shoulder. 
>"Jerk. Heheh!"

[A S S I M I L A T E]

>"Anything in particular you wanna watch on tv?"
>She shrugs.
>"Beats me. I haven't watched much tv."
>You put it on a random channel. You barely pay the tv any mind.
>"Y'know... this form is kinda growing on me."
>"What? Blech, really? ...but, if y0u like it... I guess I can live with it f0r a while, heheh."
>She smiles again.
>She then gets a strange expression, and you can almost see something in her eyes...
>A picture?
>She gets a mischievous look.

GAME SAVED

>"Hey... lemme, uh... lemme try s0mething."
>She leans over against you...
>And suddenly... melts. She becomes a sort of red rubbery substance.
>It coats your entire body.
>Before long, you are entirely enveloped in the red substance. All you can hear is the rush of fluid and Pyr3's laughter.
>Eventually, the sounds stop.
>You look down, and are met with the sight of a furry body.
>You scream, and hear yourself speaking in a different voice.
>Pyr3's voice.
>Your thoughts are hers, and her thoughts are yours. Your body is hers, within hers. 
>The two of you are...
>One.

>A picture?
>She shudders and shakes her head. The image vanishes.

[ASSIMILATE, KNOCK ON 4TH WALL]

>...you hear a faint knocking. Must be the door.
>"I think someone's outside. I'll be right back."
>As you walk away, Pyr3 smiles and waves.

>...she shudders as soon as he's out of sight.
>That... that assimilation was not all that unpleasant for her. But... clearly it was torment for him.
>Not quite death, but he would've been eventually absorbed into her consciousness, most likely. She shivered reflexively, then spoke to nobody in particular.
>"Hey... y0u may think it's unfair, but y0u D0 have s0me c0ntr0l here..."
>She immediately stops talking when Anon returns.

>"False alarm. Sorry."
>You notice a faint, upset look on her face.
>"...something the matter?"
>"Hm? 0h, it's n0thing."
>You carefully sit next to her, pull her close, and rub your hand along her muzzle. She slowly starts to smile again, her tail wagging slightly as well.
>"Heheh... thanks. S0mething just kinda... bummed me 0ut. S0me dumb thing 0n tv, I think."
>"That's alright."
>You squeeze her tightly. The two of you share a warm smile, and stay cuddled together for a while, watching tv.

[COMFORT HER.  AND ASSIMILATE, YOU COWARD]

>Her look of discomfort intensifies. Concerned, you start gently rubbing and scratching her. She seems to enjoy it, but that look never leaves her face.
>"Pyr3? What is it?"
>She doesn't respond.
>You keep petting her, worried about her state.
>You never notice her eyes go totally white.

PAUSED

>Anon stops in the middle of petting her. She breathes deeply, and begins speaking in an authoritative tone.
>"...l00k. I appreciate that y0u guys liked that little... assimilation thing. But... it w0uld've eventually killed him, m0re 0r less. He w0uld cease t0 exist, bec0ming just part 0f me. And then... we'd snap back t0 n0w. He'd f0rget. I w0uldnt."
>Her face is still uncomfortable looking.
>"S0 even th0ugh it was fun f0r a sec0nd, it's n0t w0rth it. S0rry, and thanks f0r playing al0ng. I'm g0nna unpause n0w. Can we please just dr0p this? Thanks."

UNPAUSED

>You continue scratching. She finally starts to smile again. Her tail wags happily, and she wraps an arm around you.
>She pulls you close, and kisses you on the cheek. You practically melt.

[COMFORT]

>You wordlessly change the channel. You find something more wholesome, some generic feelgood movie.
>Pyr3 smiles and hugs you again. You of course return the favor, enjoying her warmth again.
>"Mm, thanks. I feel better n0w. Must've... must've just been s0mething 0n tv. Heheh..."
>"Hey, as long as you feel better, I'm fine."
>You bury your face in her soft fur. The comfiness is almost enough to make you sleepy again.
>She gently rubs your back affectionately.
>The two of you get cozy, enjoying the movie. 
>Or, she enjoys it anyway. You keep your face buried, enjoying her warmth.
>"Heheh... I'll never get tired 0f this c0zy business. Thanks, An0n."

[CONFESS FEELINGS]

>The comfiness starts to really get to you. You can't help but spill your guts.
>"Can I tell you something? Y'know, I was pretty damn lonely before you came around. Every day was the same: lonesome. But since I met you, things have been nothing but good. You've really helped me look on the bright side again. Thank you."
>You hug her tightly. When you release, you can see little tears welling up in her eyes.
>"I... I... I'm glad that I c0uld be there f0r y0u... I 0we y0u a thanks as well. Y0ur c0mpany means a l0t t0 me."
>She sniffles and wipes her eyes, then hugs you again.
>She rests her chin atop your head.
>What she says next sends a warm feeling through your whole body.
>"An0n, y0u're a fantastic b0yfriend. Thank y0u."

[GET SOFT]

>Despite your best efforts to remain stoic, you can't help but get a little misty eyed yourself. Some tears drip into her fur as you hug her as tightly as possible.
>"Thank you... you're an amazing girlfriend, Pyr3."
>You're met with a cry of happiness and a tight squeeze.
>"Y0U SAID IT! Y0U ACTUALLY SAID IT!"
>She pulls away, and you can see real happiness on her face.
>"Y0u actually... c0nsider me that? That- that's the sweetest thing any0ne's ever said t0 me. Thank y0u, thank y0u, thank y0u!"
>She plants a huge kiss on your cheek, then, apparently unsatisfied, she pulls you in to a proper kiss.
>The two of you lock lips for what feels like an eternity. When you finally part, you're met with another warm, teary-eyed smile.
>"Thank y0u, An0n."

[SLEEP]

>The two of you kiss again, and wrap your arms around each other. She smiles, and her eyes again blink off and on.
>She's back to her normal, scarlet and skull self.
>"Ah... I d0n't mind transf0rming a little, but it's g00d t0 be myself again."
>You grin at her.
>"I can understand that. You're beautiful like that."
>She sputters unintelligibly, then smiles. You gently stroke her bony cheek.
>"Thanks again, for everything."
>"Thank y0u!"
>You glance over at the clock...
>Geez it's getting late. As if on cue, you yawn.
>"Heheh... sleepy? G0 ahead and turn in, if y0u want."
>You nod drowsily, and head off to bed.
>You start changing into your sleepwear, and hear something. You turn to see Pyr3, lying across your bed.
>"Heheh... I'm, uh... kinda sleepy myself, actually."
>She yawns cutely. You smile, and lie down beside her.
>The two of you start to doze off almost immediately.
>"G'night... An0n."
>"Good night..."
>With that, you both fall asleep.

GAME SAVED

[WAKE UP]

>Sleeping peacefully, the two of you cuddle up closely.
>Her soft, warm fur envelopes you in comfort, and her snoring serenades you. A strong arm wraps across your middle, holding you tightly yet gently.
>It's the coziest you've slept in some time.

>...you awaken in the morning feeling rested and safe.
>You glance back over your shoulder. Pyr3 is still asleep, though she has rolled to face away from you.
>You glance downward... and notice yourself standing proud downstairs.
>Well... sleeping next to a nude monster woman will do that for you.

[WISH HER A GOOD MORNING]

>You gently rise and move to a chair in front of Pyr3. You can't help but smile as you watch her sleep.
>A faint smile lingers on her skull, and she breathes in a steady, relaxing rhythm.
>You can't help but be enamored with how cute she is asleep. You gently run a hand through her fur, being careful not to wake her.
>Her smile widens, but she doesn't stir otherwise. You continue to stroke her soft, scarlet coat.
>...10 minutes pass. You gently lean closer to her and whisper.
>"Pyr3... good morning..."
>There's no response at first, but soon the light returns to her eyes. She yawns and sits up, stretching.
>"Mm... g00d m0rning..."
>Another yawn.
>"Sleep well, An0n?"
>She smiles at you, then does a minor double take as her eyes fall upon your morning wood.
>"Heheh... I'd say that's a yes."
>She grins slyly.
>"...I slept g00d, myself. It was c0zy. Thanks f0r sharing y0ur bed!"

[ROLL FOR CHARISMA.  RESULT: 1]

>As if your problem weren't bad enough already, her grin... makes things harder for you.
>You find it nigh impossible to hide your arousal, and so decide to steer into the skid.
>You gulp nervously and fiddle with your shirt collar. Geez it's hot in here.
>Remembering how confident she was when hitting you up yesterday, you attempt to summon every ounce of charisma you have.
>"H-hey, uh..."
>She perks an ear up and narrows her eyes with a smile.
>"Yeeesss...?"
>"Y-you're hot... c-can we, uh... err..."
>Her smile widens.
>"Huh? Can we what~?"
>"H-h-have... s-s..."
>She puts on a mock-surprised look.
>"An0n, are y0u asking me if I'm 'in the m00d?'"
>You snap your mouth shut and nod, blushing.
>She immediately leans forward, her chest swaying from the motion.
>"Hmm. I'd say... yes. Yes I am~"
>A suggestive look spreads across her skull.
>"Well? Whatcha have in mind?"

[CONCEDE CONTROL]

>"Th- uh, th-thanks for u-understanding... a-and your, uh..."
>"My... what? These?"
>Winking mischievously, she cups her breasts and bounces them teasingly. The sheer size of them means that they stay in motion for quite some time.
>"Y-y-yes... I-I want to... w-want you to enjoy this... can you take the lead?"
>She leans even closer to you, sending a new wave of motion through her wobbling rack.
>"Heheh... sure thing~ Let me start with... a classic."
>She kneels down and swiftly yanks your boxers down. Before you can react, you find yourself with your rod sandwiched tightly between her enormous jugs.
>The feeling is almost indescribable. The warmth... the soft fur... the sheer weight and bulk of them... the jiggling against your length...
>It all adds up to a positively heavenly experience. Pyr3 meets your eyes with a lewd gaze, then takes her chest in her hands. She then begins rhythmically rubbing her breasts up and down your shaft.
>You didn't stand a chance. It's only a few moments before she finishes you off, with you coating her furred cleavage in a fine glaze.
>She grins lewdly, and uses her forked black tongue to clean herself up.
>The sight of this nearly gets you going for another round.

[RECLAIM CONTROL]

>Your mind is lost in a haze of pleasure. Your body is already prepping for another round.
>You smile dazedly at your partner, who for her part winks and smiles back.
>"T-thank... l-love..."
>"Hm? Did I hear that L w0rd?"
>"Y-yeah... l-love you..."
>You gently reach out and touch her face, rubbing your hand against the bone in an attempt to ground yourself.
>Something suddenly seizes you... a more primal side of yourself.
>You quickly grab one of her prodigiously sized breasts. She gasps and almost immediately lets a moan of pleasure escape her mouth.
>"W-what? I th0ught I was leading here?"
>You bounce the wobbling tit in your hand experimentally, enjoying the feeling of it jiggling and the sheer weight of it. You also enjoy just how SOFT it is, between her fur and her skin.
>Pyr3 attempts to keep her composure, but quiet moans occasionally escape from her.
>Throwing caution to the wind, you gently run your fingers across her stiffening nipple. She practically screams out in ecstasy.
>"H-H0LY... d-d0n't st0p..."
>Seeing the mounting desire in her face, you quickly put your other hand to use, grabbing the neglected breast and getting to work.
>Now, with each hand full of warm, soft tit, you gently start kneading and bouncing Pyr3's melons.
>She almost immediately melts into panting and moaning, barely able to speak.
>"Mm... k-keep- ah... keep g0ing..."

[CONTINUE]

>In an uncharacteristic burst of charisma, possibly fueled by her reactions, you wink at her.
>"Mm... d-d0n't... st0p..."
>Grinning at her pleasure, you lean in for the kill.
>You make pointed eye contact and take one of her black nips into your mouth. She almost immediately yelps and plants a hand on the back of your head.
>"0H... 0H, G0D... D0N'T Y0U DARE ST0P."
>You wouldn't dream of it. While you tease the one nip with your mouth, you play with the other with a free hand. 
>You're pleased to see Pyr3 practically melting at your touch, panting and moaning uncontrollably.
>You wrap your other free arm around her, pulling her closer to you. She makes no effort to resist.
>You can feel her practically shivering at this point. Her entire body carries an electric tingle of pure pleasure.
>You glance up at her face, and see her tongue hanging out of her panting mouth. Her eyes are half-lidded, practically glowing.
>"W-where did y0u learn all this? N-nevermind, d0n't tell me. Just... just keep g0ing... p-please..."
>Her every word is peppered with pants and moans. You can't help but swell with pride at her reactions to your work.

[FINISH HER]

>Bolstered by her pleas to continue, you start getting more sensual in your actions.
>You slow your teasing of her breasts, falling into a gentle rhythm that quickly ends up punctuated by quiet gasps from Pyr3.
>You take your hand off her back and gently run it down her stomach, then her thighs.
>She lets out a long sigh of satisfaction as your hand slowly approaches her crotch.
>Once you get close, you suddenly make your move. You're immediately met with a near-howl of arousal from your partner.
>She attempts to speak, but can't get a word in over her own pleasure. She merely pants and looks at you pleadingly.
>You get the message, and continue to experiment with your hand. Practically every move you make causes her to tense up and shudder.
>You gently run a finger across her womanhood, with her letting out a long whine.
>She finally manages to choke out some words.
>"P-please just... just finish me..."
>That's all the push you need.
>With just a few delicate touches, you finally bring her to a climax.
>She nearly screams in pure bliss, then collapses forwards, leaning her weight on you.
>You quickly lose your balance, the now-satisfied beast falling on top of your prone body.
>She pants wordlessly, chest heaving with each breath.
>That feeling of pride washes over you again.

[THANK HER]

>Buried beneath her warm, shuddering form, you close your eyes in contentment. You gently lean forward and kiss her atop the skull.
>Even the bone is warm from your escapades. 
>You wrap your arms around her furry midsection and hug her tightly. She shakily raises an arm and pats your head roughly.
>"Thanks, Pyr3. I really enjoyed that. I... I love you."
>She pants for a while, attempting to speak. She eventually catches her breath.
>"F... fuck me, that was g00d. Thank y0u, An0n. I needed that, big time. I l0ve y0u t00."
>She manages to smile, still panting heavily.
>One of her ears perks up, and she mutters something under her breath.
>"...y-yeah... that's a m0d..."
>Rather than question her, you continue to run your hands up and down her back. Though, a thought does come to mind...
>"Hey, this isn't the best time to ask, but... can you change me as well?"
>She steadily rises up on her shaking arms, panting still.
>"Ah... n-n0, I d0n't think s0? I... I haven't ever been able t0. M-maybe there's a way...?"
>She collapses back on top of you heavily.
>"I'm... spent, right n0w. Y0u... y0u really kn0w h0w t0 get a lady g0ing, h-heh..."

[MOVE HER]

>Delicately, you attempt to shift her weight off of you. She IS pretty huge, and it's starting to get a little painful.
>Eventually, she notices and helps, shifting herself off to the side.
>"S-s0rry..."
>"It's fine."
>You stretch and take a few deep breaths, then hug her again.
>"Need anything in particular?"
>She smiles warmly, starting to regain her composure. 
>"N-nah... just need t0 catch my breath is all, thank y0u."
>You wrap your arms tighter around her and pull her closer.
>"I hope you know I meant what I said. I love you, Pyr3."
>She smiles again, and a few tears drip from her eyes.
>"I... I kn0w. I l0ve y0u t00. It- it means s0 much t0 me that y0u said that. Y0u're the 0nly 0ne wh0's ever said that t0 me."
>She wraps her strong arms around you, and pulls you into a kiss.
>"Thank y0u s0 much."

[THANK HER]

>"You're welcome; I should be thanking YOU, actually. Thank you for everything, Pyr3."
>She smiles lovingly and, as if to remind you she's not entirely natural, pink, heart shaped pupils appear in her eyes.
>You lean in and kiss her again. She pulls you close, and the two of you lock lips(?) for what feels like an eternity.
>Then, when you break the kiss apart, you break out the big guns:
>You rub her belly.
>Immediately she smiles again, her tail wagging against the mattress.
>She perks up an ear, and wordlessly blinks in and out of her code again.
>"Hm? What'd you change?"
>"0h, well, I th0ught ab0ut it, and decided t0 make myself lighter. Just in case, y'kn0w? I d0n't want t0 hurt y0u."
>"Thanks; I appreciate that."
>She grins again.

[HAVE BREAKFAST]

>After that rather physical morning, your stomach growls. Feeling especially self-confident, you grab Pyr3 and lift her up.
>Considering she lightened herself, you carry her to the kitchen rather easily, with her giggling the whole way.
>You don't even bother to get dressed; might as well make this a nude breakfast.
>"Heheheheh! What a str0ngman y0u are!"
>Eventually, you set her down. She almost looks a bit disappointed for a moment.
>"Alright; I've got bacon, eggs, and toast. What sounds good?"
>"Hmm... I dunn0, heh. H0w ab0ut a bit 0f each?"
>"Sure thing. Do you have any favorites when it comes to food?"
>"Heh... n0t really; I'm n0t a picky eater."
>"Fair enough, I guess."
>You start cooking breakfast, and note that you'll need to go buy groceries soon...
>Breakfast goes off without a hitch; Pyr3, as usual, scarfs down her share of the meal effortlessly, in less than a minute.

[MAKE PLANS]

>Compared to her, you finish your breakfast at a much slower pace.
>You smile at her and start planning your day.
>"I've got some errands to run today, if you wanna come with."
>"Hm. Yeah, sure."
>"Maybe we'll have time to hit the park, or some of the spookier places around town."
>"00h, n0w y0u're talkin'! L0ve me s0me sp00ks."
>"A-and, ah... one more thing..."
>"Yeeesss?"
>"You, uh, you... you wanna go another round?"
>A massive grin spreads across her skull.
>"Heheh. Sure~ Whatcha thinking this time?"

[ROUND 2]
GAME SAVED

>Staring at that wicked grin immediately has you standing at attention again.
>"Uhh... well, y'know, last night..."
>"0hhhh, I see. Y0u wanna... actually D0 me, with0ut the wh0le parameter pr0blem. Heh, alright then."
>"Y-you can take the lead again..."
>"Again? Heh! I seem t0 remember Y0U taking 0ver this m0rning~"
>"O-oh yeah... well, you can take charge this time."
>That grin comes back.
>"Alright then. Y0u want any m0ds 0n 0r..."
>"No... not this time; let's keep this straightforward."
>"00hh... a purist, are we~?"
>She winks seductively and walks towards your bedroom, making it a point to sway her hips as she goes.
>Just as she enters the doorway, she looks over her shoulder with a wink.
>...yep, you're definitely set to go.
>You follow her, and she's already lying on her back, on your bed.
>"I'm all y0urs, heheh~"
>She sticks her tongue out teasingly and winks again.

[CONTINUE]

>Your nerves rattle you a bit, but you climb into bed with the monstrous woman. You gently press your face against her neck, enjoying the warm, cinnamon-scented fur.
>You shakily reach out an arm, and take hold of her midsection before pulling yourself close to her.
>Before long, your body is pressed against hers, the soft fur caressing every inch of your skin.
>She winks again.
>"Y-you... can you give me... a little direction?"
>She chuckles a bit.
>"Heheh, y0u nerv0us? I think y0u kn0w what t0 d0."
>...she's right. You DO know.
>With a sudden burst of energy, you pull her even closer. As you press against her, you can feel yourself growing more and more erect; this isn't lost on your partner, either.
>For her part, she throws a leg over you, and stares at you with that smoldering gaze.
>Suddenly, time seems to slow down.
>You've found your mark.
>As soon as you enter her, she yelps in delight.
>"T-there y0u g0..."
>Encouraged by her lustful smile, you rhythmically pump your hips. Every thrust sends her massive chest into a fit of wobbling.
>She begins unconsciously rubbing her leg up and down your legs. She again falls into panting and moaning as you continue your assault.
>Her tail, freed up when she rolled onto her side, spasms occasionally as you go.
>She dazedly gives you a smooch on the cheek, and you turn it into a full on kiss.
>The room is filled with panting, moaning, and the rhythmic sounds of your thrusts.
>Pyr3 continues to occasionally let out yelps of pleasure as you go. Despite you giving her the option to take charge, she seems content to let you steer the ship again.
>The sheer warmth of her slit surrounds you, making your climax an inevitability.
>As you feel yourself about to finish, you press even closer to her, her soft breasts squishing against your chest.
>The two of you finally let out two long, loud screams of pleasure as your escapade reaches its wonderful, wonderful end.

[LEAVE]

>Still enjoying the afterglow of your escapades, you bury your face in her furred chest.
>The two of you lie there, catching your breath and enjoying each other's warmth for a good while.
>Eventually, you shift yourself up, getting eye to eye with her. You kiss her bony cheek, and begin stroking her snout.
>"Thank you again, for everything."
>"Thank y0u; l-l0ve y0u..."
>"Love you too, Pyr3."
>You hug her close, her skull pressed against your chest. You gently stroke her ears...
>Which twitch fitfully every time you make contact.
>"C-cut it 0ut!"
>You comply, going back to rubbing her skull instead.

>...eventually, the two of you regain composure and head out for the day. You've got errands to take care of, but first...
>"I promised you some spooks today; let's check out the old lab."
>"000h... n0w we're talking, heh!"
>The lab's been here for years. Nobody goes in there, and there are countless rumors as to what's in there.
>It's a popular spot for people like you who don't mind a little urban spelunking.
>You idly wonder if you'll encounter anything interesting...

[WARNING: ENEMIES APPROACHING]

>Normally the old lab creeps you out a bit. But...
>With Pyr3 by your side, you're not remotely afraid. You lead her up to the doors, her jagged smile widening as you approach.
>Then, a shout rings out from behind you.
>"EY! YOU ON OUR TURF SON; HAND OVER THE WALLET!"
>You turn around to see a gang of knife-wielding punks.
>Great. You thought this little pack of wannabes broke up when their last leader got shipped off to military school.
>They all surround you, blocking any escape routes. You sigh and start looking for the weakest one. You figure if you just give him a good kick to the nuts they'll all run scared.
>But, then you hear it.
>A low, thunderous growl from behind you.
>The leader of the punks screams.
>"YO THE FUCK IS THAT?"
>The gang stare at you in horror and run, dropping their knives.
>You turn around to see Pyr3 smiling toothily and mockingly waving goodbye.
>"Did you..."
>"What? I didn't d0 anything but sh0w them y0u weren't al0ne, heheh."

>...not entirely true.
>What the gang saw was a massive, hulking creature with fangs nearly the size of their arms. Slavering, foaming at the mouth, teeth apparently bloodstained.
>Of course they ran; some of them even had to change pants afterward.

>"...right. Well, thank you either way."
>"N0 pr0blem, heheh!"

[ENTER]

>After that incident, you and your companion head into the lab.
>Nobody really knows exactly what happened to the researchers, but one day the lab was just... 
>Empty.
>It's been empty ever since.
>The place was supposedly an animal testing lab of some kind. Probably working with experimental medicine and stuff.
>That's probably why there are still beakers of mystery chemicals lying around. As well as bottles of pills, piles of syringes, and that sort of thing.
>Many, many rumors had persisted about this place, the most enduring of which was...
>The breathing.
>It's always been said that you can hear SOMETHING breathing in the deepest parts of the place. Of course, nobody has ever proven or disproven it.
>You and Pyr3 walk through the dark, dusty facility, her face aglow with wonder.
>"Heheh, I like this place. Nice and sp00ky."
>"M-me too..."
>You can't help but get a little nervous in this place.
>Apparently sensing your fear, Pyr3 silently takes your hand, her dulled claws gently resting against your wrist.

[CONTINUE]

>The two of you continue to walk through the abandoned halls.
>"S0... what's the st0ry here, eh?"
>Nobody's really sure. Used to be an animal testing lab, apparently. One day everyone just... stopped coming here. Some people say it was shut down for safety issues. Other people... well, they have their ideas."
>"0h... s0 what d0 Y0U think?"
>"I... don't know. There's a lot of rumors about this place. Like, there's supposed to be some kinda breathing you can hear in the deeper rooms..."
>"Wh0a, really? I g0tta hear that!"
>She squeezes your hand excitedly, and you pick up your pace.
>As you walk through, you can't help but scan the shelves of chemicals and medicines. Nothing looks familiar, nor particularly useful.
>You do grab a scalpel you find laying around, JUUUST in case.
>You continue walking, telling more stories about the lab, until Pyr3 suddenly stops you.
>"Listen. Hear it?"
>"Huh? What are you talking about?"
>She rolls her eyes, but smiles, excitement mounting.
>"I can hear the breathing~!"
>SHIT.

[LISTEN]

>"Y-you're not serious, right?"
>Her smile is practically ear to ear at this point.
>"I'm t0tally seri0us, listen."
>You discretely grip her hand harder, and listen as closely as you can.
>Mother of god.
>You can hear a very faint, ragged breathing sound.
>A chill settles over you. However, your companion's hype cuts through it somewhat, her eagerness making her oddly adorable.
>"Did y0u hear it?"
>"Y-yeah..."
>"It's c0ming fr0m under us... I think there's a stairwell 0ver there. Y0u wanna g0 see what it is?"
>Not really, no.
>"S-sure..."
>"Hey, if it really IS s0mething, I'm here. I'll keep y0u safe. Let's g0."
>Shivering, you descend the stairs.
>A musty, almost... damp smell fills the air down here. The breathing is definitely audible now.
>You can almost sense that...
>Something is in here.

[INVESTIGATE]
GAME SAVED

>You cautiously proceed, with Pyr3 casually taking the lead.
>The floor is moist, and the air is heavy and humid. That damp stench clings to everything in here.
>Though, the cinnamon aroma of your companion cuts through it a little bit.
>That ragged breathing grows louder and louder as you proceed.
>Pyr3 is absolutely giddy at this point. You're starting to get excited yourself, a little.
>...but you keep that scalpel at the ready.
>Suddenly, as you walk, you accidentally knock a beaker off a desk. The glass shatters, echoing through the rooms.
>The breathing suddenly stops.
>There's a short pause, and an inquisitive grunt.
>Then... the breathing resumes, this time, it sounds to be steadily approaching you.
>S H I T.
>You brandish your scalpel, and Pyr3 squints into the darkness.
>You begin to hear another sound...
>Moist-sounding footsteps. And fast ones at that.
>Whatever this thing is, it's gonna be here any second.
>The damp smell intensifies, now carrying a faintly...
>Sweet scent?

[PREPARE FOR CONTACT]

>This is definitely not good. Not at all.
>The footsteps grow closer, the breathing more ragged and wheezy.
>You get into a combat-ready (and not at all cribbed from old action movies) pose, and look up at Pyr3.
>She simply blips into her code again, with her claws visibly returning to their deadly sharpness from when you first met.
>The two of you watch the entrance to the room...
>And are both taken aback when IT arrives. The creature's appearance is not at all what you expected, if you indeed expected anything.
>At first shake, you're tempted to call it feline. But, it's clearly more than that.
>The creature is fairly large, and it crawls on all fours. However, it seems to have a similar "monstrous but humanoid" shape to Pyr3. Albeit, minus the prodigious bust.
>Rather than luscious red fur, this creature has a damp-looking, vaguely... fungal coat? It seems to be a desaturated purple in color.
>The creature's head is bizarre, the bottom half resembling the bottom half of some large cat's head. Meanwhile, the top half is vaguely reminiscent of some sort of mushroom? Pointed ears jut awkwardly from this fungal skull, twitching madly.
>The entire thing reeks of must and mold, though a sweet scent occasionally cuts through the gloom.
>A short, stubby tail twitches violently at the beast's rear.
>It enters the room and halts, panting and wheezing.
>Slowly, ever so slowly, it rises onto its back legs, standing up to reveal that it's only an inch or two taller than you.
>You carefully take a step back, and Pyr3 moves in front of you.

[ATTACK?]

>"I... dunn0 ab0ut this thing."
>The creature perks up an ear and turns towards Pyr3. It... attempts to speak?
>"GREHCK..."
>"Huh? S0rry pal, I d0n't understand."
>The beast tilts its mushroomy head in confusion, and slowly walks towards Pyr3. She brandishes a clawed hand.
>"Sl0w d0wn there. Y0u d0n't want me t0 get seri0us."
>To your shock, the fungal being... stops advancing.
>It tentatively reaches an arm towards Pyr3. She leans away from it.
>"...what are y0u trying t0 d0?"
>It wheezes loudly, and again seems to... speak.
>"G... GERCHK..."
>It staggers forward a bit, and immediately steps back away from Pyr3, holding its... paws? Hands?
>Whatever they are, it holds them out in front of itself as it retreats.
>Once it gets a considerable distance from your companion, it carefully lowers its arms.
>You carefully grab a nearby beaker, ready to chuck it if this freak tries anything.

[TALK]

>But... it really doesn't seem to be after a fight.
>"Pyr3, I think it... wants to talk."
>"Huh? I... I d0n't kn0w if it CAN talk..."
>The creature looks back and forth from you to Pyr3 as you talk, and nods vigorously you say it wants to talk.
>Hm.
>"Let's just ask yes or no questions."
>"G0tcha. Uh... d0 y0u want t0 hurt us?"
>It shakes its head rapidly.
>"GREH... EKH."
>"Have you been here long?"
>It seems to think... and slowly, somberly nods.
>"Are y0u... danger0us?"
>There's a pause, and it slowly tilts its head.
>Hm.
>"Did you cause all this?"
>You gesture to the lab in general.
>It nods, wheezing and breathing shakily.
>Pyr3 carefully raises a clawed hand.
>"...did y0u... kill any0ne?"
>The thing gasps audibly and shakes its head incredibly rapidly. So rapidly, it actually loses its balance and nearly falls over.
>When it manages to regain its footing, it gasps for breath for a moment.

[INTERVIEW]

>"Can you write? I think I saw a pen and paper earlier."
>It tilts its head again, but nods slowly.
>You quickly retrace your steps, with Pyr3 remaining behind.
>When you return, she and the creature are still exactly where you left them.
>You set the pen and paper on the ground, and step back. The creature takes them and sits on its haunches.
>"Okay... is the air around you safe?"
>The creature huffs, and scrawls YES on the paper, then holds it up proudly. The handwriting is huge, and absolutely awful. It's just BARELY legible.
>Well, that's a relief.
>"Wait... n0 sp0res?"
>Again, it writes an answer.
>YES BUT SAFE
>"Safe how, exactly?"
>ONLY EFFECTS CATS
>"0kay then... what happened?"
>EXPERIMENTS
>"What kind?"
>The creature breathes rather heavily. You almost think you hear it...
>Getting emotional?
>BAD
>"Were y0u... always like this?"
>NO, WAS HEALTHIER ONCE
>"But... you've always been... this?"
>YES, WAS BORN THIS WAY
>The creature suddenly lets out a frustrated grunt.
>It ran out of room on the paper.

[INTERVIEW]

>Clearly upset, the cat-thing curls into a ball, wheezing quietly. Pyr3 looks at it with pity in her eyes.
>"An0n, g0 find s0me m0re paper; I can't stand t0 see it sad."
>You agree. Poor thing.
>Unfortunately, you find no usable paper. What few scraps you find are soggy or covered in writing already.
>Determined to help the creature, you keep digging through the lab's contents...
>And eventually strike gold. You find a small whiteboard and some markers.
>When you return to the basement, Pyr3 is gently patting the creature on the back. You carefully walk up to it and lay your find down.
>The fungal beast gently raises its head...
>And immediately perks up when it sees the writing utensils.
>"Thanks An0n. N0w then... are there m0re... things living here?"
>It takes a moment, but the thing soon scrawls an answer on the board.
>NOT ANYMORE
>It hastily erases its answer with the palm of its hand.
>"What do you do for food?"
>EAT WHATEVER I FIND
>"...what w0uld y0u even find d0wn here?"
>MEDICINE, SOMETIMES ANIMALS
>"Do you have a name?"
>The creature's breathing gets a bit more labored, and its writing more shaky.
>N O
>"Y0u p00r thing. Is there anything we can d0?"
>It seems to ponder this for a moment.
>TAKE
>It immediately stops writing and erases the word. It gently sets the whiteboard down, then hangs its head, breathing raggedly.

[MAKE A PLAN]

>You tentatively run a hand over the beast's mushroom head...
>It's damp, very soft, and... has a lot of give to it. Your hand sinks in slightly.
>The creature very faintly purrs.
>You and Pyr3 share a look.
>"Hey, uh... we'll be right back, okay? Here, have some food."
>You unpack a sandwich you had brought along for a midday snack. The creature sniffs it cautiously, then gently takes it from you.
>As you walk away, it wolfs down the food quickly.
>Once you're out of earshot, you whisper to Pyr3.
>"We can't leave it here."
>"N0, n0 we can't. Y0u wanna take it h0me?"
>"Do you think that's a good idea?"
>She shrugs.
>"Hasn't made any attempt t0 hurt us, has it? I think it's fine."
>"How could we get it home? It's not invisible like you."
>"Hmm. I'm sure y0u can think of s0me way."
>"So we're doing this? Getting... a pet?"
>"That thing's intelligent An0n. It's m0re like... getting a weird r00mmate."
>"True. Guess we ought to give it a name?"
>"We'll discuss that with it, eh?"
>The two of you nod and make your way back to the mushroom cat.
>It's sitting where you left it, hungrily licking the crumbs of the sandwich off its hands.
>"Hey... we're gonna get you out of here."
>It gasps in surprise. And writes something.
>NEW HOME?
>"Yep."
>It lets out a cry of happiness and stands up. It motions as if to hug you, but stops itself.
>"What do you want us to call you?"
>It stoops down to grab the whiteboard.
>DOESN'T MATTER

[PERCY]

>"Okay... what about Percy?"
>The cat-thing nods vigorously, the corners of its fanged mouth curving up into a smile.
>PERCY. I LIKE IT
>Percy again moves as if to hug you, and again stops.
>Pyr3 smiles down at your new friend.
>"Hey, c'mere y0u."
>She steps forward and squeezes the creature tightly. Its stubby tail wags happily.
>With that, the three of you climb the stairs and head back to the ground level.
>Percy again smiles, and walks along behind you, damp feet slapping against the floor. Despite the new spring in its step, it still breathes heavily.
>Eventually, you make it to the entrance of the lab. You cautiously poke your head out...
>The coast is clear. Percy suddenly runs past you, and stops just outside.
>The fungal creature looks up at the sun in awe.
>Now that you have better lighting, you can make out a little more about Percy.
>Namely that she's a girl.
>Modestly sized, perky breasts and wide, curvy hips confirm that much.
>Her coat is indeed a desaturated purple, and is coated in small mushrooms. It also seems to be damp.
>A few small tags line one of her ears.
>Very small, curved claws tip her fingers and toes, and her hands look more like paws than Pyr3's do.
>You walk up to your new friend and lay a hand on her shoulder. She flinches.
>"So, uh... do you want a different name, since you're a girl?"
>You hand her the whiteboard again.
>NO. I LIKE PERCY
>Fair enough.

[TAKE HER HOME]

>You gently rub Percy's shoulder, with her still staring up at the sky. Quickly looking down, she shakily writes:
>NEVER SEEN THE SUN. ONLY PICTURES
>...it occurs to you that you have no idea where her eyes are, as you haven't seen any on her mushroom head. Apparently she can see, though.
>"Well... you may not be able to get out much at my place. Is that okay?"
>WARM?
>"Yes, I keep it warm in my house."
>DRY?
>"Yep."
>She takes a deep, shuddering breath.
>SAFE?
>You smile and hug her. She's damp to the touch, and her body seems to... squish slightly, only to recoil when you let go. Her fur is thick and rather cool.
>"Yes. We'll keep you safe. I promise."
>THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK-
>She runs out of room on the board.
>"You're welcome. Pyr3, wait here with her; I'll run home and get the car."
>"G0tcha."
>You jog back to your house. Luckily, you don't live too far from the lab. You also grab a big jacket from your closet; should help conceal Percy.
>By the time you drive back, Pyr3 is smiling warmly at Percy, who is lying in the grass, watching the sky with a smile.
>"You alright?"
>YES JUST HAPPY SO HAPPY
>"Alright, good. Well, whenever you're ready, hop in and we'll go home."
>She hesitates.
>HOME.
>There's a pause, and she lets off another cry of happiness.
>The three of you pile into your car.

[ARRIVE AT YOUR HOUSE]

>The drive home isn't very long, but Percy is practically ecstatic the entire time.  She stares out the windows of your car, taking in the scenery as it rolls by.
>Pyr3 occasionally reads off what your newfound friend is writing.
>SO HAPPY, HAVE FRIENDS AND A NEW HOME
>"Aww, y0u're ad0rable, Percy.  I'm glad y0u think 0f us as friends."
>You smile and pull into your driveway.  You carefully drape the jacket over Percy, and she steps out of the car.
>She purrs loudly as soon as she steps into your house.
>SO WARM
>"Comfortable?  I can turn the heat down if it's too hot."
>NO NO, PERFECT
>She wanders around the house, leaving little damp footprints behind her.  Her ears and tail twitch constantly.
>You walk over and hug Pyr3.
>"Hey.  Thanks for the help; I'm glad we could help her."
>"N0 pr0blem.  Me t00; I was afraid we'd have t0 fight, but she's actually really cute.  ...f0r a weird mushr00m thing, anyway."
>Percy walks by, carrying her whiteboard still.
>HOME IS VERY NICE
>"Glad you like it.  Want me to fix some lunch?"
>YES PLEASE
>You chuckle and pat her on the back.  She flinches at first, but then seems to appreciate it.
>The question is...
>What would someone like her even eat...?

[COOK FISH]

>Thinking on it, you decide to cook some fish for lunch.  She IS at least partially a cat, right?
>Once you get lunch started, you sit down at the table.  Pyr3 and Percy are already there, chatting away.
>"S0 y0u like it here, then?"
>YES, VERY MUCH
>Pyr3 chuckles.
>"Y0u haven't even been here that l0ng, heheh!"
>Percy... laughs?  Her laugh is slow and raspy, almost more like a cough than anything.
>I KNOW, BUT STILL LIKE IT
>She smiles at you.
>WHAT ARE YOUR NAMES?
>"I'm Anon, and she's Pyr3."
>AND I'M PERCY
>You can't help but snicker a little.
>"Yes, you're Percy."
>Again, she laughs.
>"Y0u're pretty sweet, Percy."
>THANK YOU
>You excuse yourself to check the food.
>Still needs a little time.
>You return to the table.  Ah well, maybe you can pass the time just shooting the breeze.

[CHAT]

>In an effort to keep your new friend feeling comfortable, you pull out your phone and play some relaxing music.
>Her ears perk up and swivel towards the sound.
>THAT'S NICE
>You smile, and an idea comes to mind.
>"Say, how would you like for me to get you some stuff to draw with?  I bet you'd enjoy that."
>Percy smiles and nods.
>YES PLEASE
>"Great.  I'll be sure to round up some tools after lunch.  Speaking of: you wanna get cleaned up after we eat?  That old lab was pretty nasty."
>She nods again, but more cautiously this time.
>Pyr3, who's been sitting quietly, speaks up.
>"S0, I have t0 ask: what's y0ur st0ry?"
>The mushroom cat breathes a long, rattling sigh.  She begins writing, wiping the board clean after every sentence.
>I WAS BORN IN THE LAB
>EXPERIMENTED ON DAILY
>IT WAS AWFUL
>THEY WERE AFRAID OF ME
>TREATED ME BADLY 
>VERY BADLY
>I ALMOST DIED
>SEVERAL TIMES, ACTUALLY
>THEN, THEY LEFT
>LEFT ME FOR DEAD
>She stops writing suddenly, sniffling.  She drops the marker and buries her face in her hands.
>Immediately, you and Pyr3 move in to comfort her.
>"You're safe now.  We're here for you."
>Her sniffling continues, but she regains a little of her composure.
>SORRY, HARD TO THINK ABOUT
>"Hey, I get it.  Y0u just take it easy, alright?  Y0u're g0nna be fine here."
>She slowly straightens up, and eventually calms down.
>You politely excuse yourself, and go check on the food again.  It's done, so you serve up lunch.
>As usual, Pyr3 finishes her plate in minutes.  Percy is considerably slower, barely finishing half her food by the time you've already cleared your plate.
>She smiles sheepishly.
>"Take your time.  There's no rush."

[LET HER FINISH]

>While she slowly finishes eating, you gently pat Percy's soft head.  She purrs appreciatively, but is too preoccupied with her food to write a thank you.
>Pyr3 smiles at your new friend.
>"H0pe y0u like An0n's c00king."
>Percy nods happily.
>It occurs to you: you totally forgot about going grocery shopping today.
>Ah well.  There's always tomorrow.  Probably need to stay here and get Percy settled.
>You do make a shopping list on your phone, though.
>Eventually, the cat thing finishes her food, letting off a satisfied sigh.
>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WHILE
>I'M FULL
>She smiles at you appreciatively, and you pat her head again.
>"Ready for that bath now?"
>She nods, and you lead her to the tub.
>You figure she doesn't need to soak long, nor get too hot, so you run some nice warm water.
>Percy eases into the water cautiously, and quickly relaxes with a sigh.
>The water almost immediately gets a bit murky, to her apparent embarrassment.

[LEAVE HER]

>"Do you want any help scrubbing or anything?"
>The relaxed fungoid shakes her head.
>"Alright then; I'll leave you here with Pyr3 and some towels.  Enjoy!"
>Percy waves goodbye as you leave, and Pyr3 grins.
>While she soaks, you decide to get a sleeping arrangement set up.  You decide to put her on the couch for now.
>You find some old blankets and pillows, and spend some time making a perfectly cozy little nest...

[CONTROL SHIFTING TO PERCY]

>She had never been so comfortable in her life.
>The water was perfectly warm, and felt wonderful.  She managed to work out some stubborn, painful mats in her fur.
>Percy was content.
>She couldn't help but feel grateful for her new friends, Anon and Pyr3.  They barely knew her, and yet had already done so much for her.
>She smiled and laid back, enjoying the warm bath.

[SPEAK TO PYR3]

>Percy turned her head towards her new friend, Pyr3.  She... kinda fascinated Percy; the fungal feline had only seen humans and... other test subjects before.
>She caught the skull-faced creature's attention and mimed writing something.
>"0h, y0ur b0ard?  Lemme grab it f0r ya."
>Sure enough, the red-furred woman handed over the whiteboard and markers.
>Percy was a little embarrassed at her inability to speak.  She had at least taught herself to read and write, though.  She wrote a message to Pyr3.
>TELL ME ABOUT YOURSELF
>"Wh- me?  Well... what d0 y0u wanna kn0w?"
>WERE YOU IN A LAB?
>"N0... I'm a digital being; s0me0ne c0ded me."
>Though she usually kept silent, Percy couldn't help but express her confusion.
>"GREH?"
>HOW ARE YOU HERE THEN?
>"It's weird and c0mplicated, but basically An0n br0ught me here."
>Anon.  Percy had a deep appreciation for him now.
>TELL ME ABOUT ANON
>Pyr3 smiled dreamily.
>"He's a really nice pers0n.  I l0ve him, and I'm sure y0u will t00."
>SAFE?
>"Yes, he'll keep y0u safe.  Y0u d0n't have t0 w0rry, Percy; we're here f0r y0u."
>Percy smiled at her newfound friend, and reached a wet hand out to her.  Pyr3 stooped down, and, shakily, the cat patted her on the shoulder.
>"Y0u're really sweet.  Are y0u feeling cleaner n0w?"
>YES
>She really was.  All the dust and grime from the lab was washing out of her thick fur.  It was still a dingy color, but then again it was always that way.
>Some of the smaller mushrooms growing on her had fallen off.  She noted with some relief that they'd definitely grow back.

[HUG]

>Percy took pride in being rather well-read, all things considered.  When THEY left the lab, they left all manner of books behind.
>She had taught herself to read them, to learn about the world outside.  
>All this knowledge gave her the perfect word to describe her situation now:
>Paradise.
>She was happier than she had ever been in her life.  These two people, who had only just met her, had opened their hearts and lives to her on a whim.  They had already done so much...
>She lacked eyes in the traditional sense, but tears of happiness leaked out from beneath her mushroom head's "cap."
>Percy slowly rose out of the warm bath, and tentatively dried off.  Of course, her fur was still damp; it always was, even when she was perfectly clean.
>A deep, dark part of her felt that this paradise had to be a trick.  That something would inevitably snatch away this newfound happiness.
>A shiver ran across her whole body, and she reached out to Pyr3.
>"Huh?  0h, need a hug?  That's fine.  C'mere."
>The tall, red beast squeezed her fungal friend tightly.
>Percy stifled a giggle.  Her skin was spongy and soft, since she was part fungus and all.  It always felt... oddly satisfying when something sunk into her flesh.
>These hugs that Anon and Pyr3 had given her... they felt wonderful.  She gently wrapped her own arms around Pyr3, and began to purr.
>"Y0u sure are s0ft... and y0ur fur feels better n0w.  I bet y0u feel a l0t better, huh?"
>She nodded; it did feel nice to be clean for once.  It was nigh-impossible to keep herself from picking up the grime and filth of her old home.
>But... now that wouldn't be a problem anymore.

[CONTINUE HUG]

>Pyr3 continued to hug her close.  A warm, comforting smell reached her nose, and she couldn't help but sniff the air.
>"Hm?  Y0u like that?  It's cinnam0n, my fav0rite."
>It was a very nice change of pace from the sterile, dusty smell of the lab.  Pyr3 herself seemed to take notice of something...
>"Is... is that... y0u?  That sweet smell?"
>Percy couldn't help but laugh.  ...her laugh was always a little ugly and uncomfortable sounding, but it was genuine.  She nodded once she stopped chuckling.
>"It's pretty nice; it's a l0t clearer than it was earlier."
>The two monsters continued to share a warm, friendly embrace, until Percy eventually pulled away.
>Not that she wasn't enjoying it; she just needed to ask a question, and so needed her hands free.
>WHERE IS ANON?
>"I think he's fixing y0u s0mewhere t0 sleep."
>Mm... sleep sounded pretty good right about now.  She wasn't sure if she was tired or just comfortable enough to doze off, but she did feel like a nap would be nice.
>"Whatcha need him f0r?"
>WANTED-
>She quickly erased her message partway through, feeling her cheeks flush under her fur.
>"Wanted what?  Y0u can tell me."
>Embarrassed, Percy finished her message.
>WANTED MORE HUGS, FROM BOTH OF YOU
>Pyr3's eyes practically lit up.
>"Awww, y0u're melting my heart here.  I think he's busy right n0w, but I'll make sure y0u get that gr0up hug."
>THANK YOU
>The red beast chuckled warmly and patted Percy's head.  She loved it when people did that; it felt really nice.

[CONTROL RETURNING TO ANON]

>...aaand done.  You've made a respectable little nest for your new roommate.
>You turn to go fetch her, and nearly walk right into her and Pyr3.
>Percy looks... much cleaner.  Her fur is still a dull purple, but her coat is much cleaner and smoother.  Some of the mushrooms that dotted her body are gone.
>The mats you noticed in her fur earlier are gone, and that damp, musty smell is gone.  Instead, you can just faintly smell something sweet.
>She smiles at you, and holds up her whiteboard.
>HOW DO I LOOK?
>"Very nice.  Do you feel better?"
>She nods, and reaches out towards you.
>"An0n, she insists that we need t0 d0 a gr0up hug.  And h0nestly?  I'm t0tally c00l with that.  She's s000 cute."
>You smile at the two monsters and pull them into a warm hug.  The cinnamon aroma of Pyr3 and the vague sweetness of Percy combine, making the air smell almost like a candle shop.
>It's slightly disconcerting, how your arm sinks into Percy's spongy skin.  But... her coat is pleasantly cool and smooth now.  Albeit, a little damp-feeling.
>The three of you share the hug for quite a while, and you can't help but notice something...
>An inky black fluid drips down from the base of Percy's mushroom cap.
>"Uh... are you alright?"
>She nods quickly.
>"I think th0se are basically tears f0r her?"
>The fungus breaks away for a second to grab her whiteboard.
>YES, TEARS OF JOY
>She immediately rejoins the hug, purring loudly as more tears drip from her face.

[SHOW OFF NEST]

>You and Pyr3 share a patient smile as your feline friend continues to purr.  Percy shakes ever so slightly, and her grip on you tightens.
>The tears are flowing at full speed now, and she wears a wavering smile.
>Eventually, she steps out of the group hug.
>THANK YOU BOTH.  SORRY FOR CRYING
>"What?  Don't apologize for that.  You're absolutely fine."
>I'M JUST SO HAPPY
>"I'm sure y0u are; I'm happy y0u're 0ut 0f that miserable 0ld lab."
>You gently pat Percy's mushroom cap, marveling at how soft it is.  Then, you gently scratch her behind the ears.  They twitch madly as you do so, and she leans her head towards you.
>THANK YOU
>"No problem.  You wanna see the bed I made for you?"
>YES PLEASE
>You show her the makeshift nest, and she looks at it with apparent curiosity.
>"Go ahead and try it out."
>Slowly, hesitantly, she gets into the nest.  She soon seems to get comfortable, and smiles.
>COMFY
>"Good."
>"Heheh, y0u're pretty cute, all c0zy like that."
>Percy's smile fades a little.
>CUTE?  ME?
>"Yes, y0u!"
>There's a long pause.
>HOW

[EXPLAIN]

>"Well... everything about you is cute: your fur, your purring, how excited you are about everything, even your squishy head."
>NOT SCARY?
>"0f c0urse n0t!"
>NOT A FREAK?  A MONSTER?
>"No, you're neither of those.  You're Percy, and you're our friend."
>REALLY?
>"Yes, really."
>There's a long pause.  She starts to write something, but stops herself.  She sniffles a bit, and more tears leak from beneath her cap.
>Shakily, she writes out:
>THANK YOU BOTH
>"Hey, it's n0 pr0blem.  D0n't be hard 0n y0urself; y0u are abs0lutely ad0rable, and d0n't ever tell y0urself 0therwise."
>Percy attempts to say something through her tears of happiness.
>"G-GEHCK..."
>You smile and hug her tightly, again feeling that strange sensation of your arms sinking into her.  Pyr3 joins you, the two of you wrapping the mushroom cat in warmth and comfort.
>She smiles genuinely, and purrs quietly.

[PET]

>Determined to keep her happy and comfortable, you gently rub your hand across her head.  It's... extremely strange-feeling, being literally a mushroom cap and all.
>As you pet her, she constantly tilts her head towards your hand, purring and smiling.  Her fangs glint in the light when she looks upwards.
>Seeing an opportunity, Pyr3 scratches Percy under the chin, being extremely careful even with her dulled claws.  The cat's purring intensifies.
>You can't help but smile, seeing how happy she is.  She gently reaches out a hand, and pats your back tentatively.
>When Pyr3 stops scratching her chin, Percy looks down and writes:
>FIRST TIME I'VE GOTTEN
>She seems to think for a moment, then finishes her sentence.
>FIRST TIME I'VE GOTTEN AFFECTION
>"Wait, ever?  Y0u p00r thing."
>Pyr3 sits next to Percy and brings her into a warm hug.  The cat wriggles an arm free and attempts to continue writing.  You hold the board up for her.
>YES FIRST EVER
>She drops the marker and returns Pyr3's hug, squeezing the red beast tightly.

[WATCH A MOVIE]
GAME SAVED

>You take a seat next to Percy, and glance at the clock.
>It's... not all that late, actually.  It's dark out, but you could probably slip in a movie before bed.
>"Hey, you guys wanna watch a movie?"
>"GEH?"
>"Huh?  D0 y0u kn0w what a m0vie is?"
>The fungus thinks, then shakes her head.  You chuckle and pat her cap again.
>"You're in for a treat then.  I think you'll like this."
>You pull up Netflix, and start the first thing you find that looks upbeat.  Some generic comedy movie you've never seen before.
>As soon as it starts, Percy's... uh, lack of eyes are glued to the screen.  She grins widely and breaks into that painful-sounding laugh every now and then.
>Out of the corner of your eyes, you see her very cautiously, very hesitantly stretch her arms out.  She then reaches out and gently wraps an arm around both you and Pyr3.
>Before you can say anything, she quickly releases you both, pulling her arms back to her sides.
>She very faintly shakes her head, then returns to laughing at the movie.

[GET COMFIER]

>Nope.  You're not going to let her feel like she can't get comfortable around you.
>You and Pyr3 share a glance, and nod, understanding each other.
>Before she can protest, you take hold of Percy's arm.  She flinches, and her jaw drops.  You carefully guide her hand back to where she wanted to rest it before.
>Pyr3 does the same with her other arm.
>Once she's holding both of you again, you smile at Percy.
>"There you go.  Is that what you wanted?"
>She looks a bit embarrassed, but nods.
>You smile and throw an arm around her, then pull yourself closer to her.
>"Comfy?"
>She purrs loudly and squeezes you tightly.
>"I'll take that as a yes."
>You and Pyr3 both scooch in close, snuggling against your fungal friend.
>She's very soft, and you barely even notice her dampness anymore.  Your hand brushes against several small mushrooms growing on her.
>You can feel her purring as well; it's a comfortable, low rumble.  It feels even better because it lets you know she's happy.
>She practically beams with happiness, and pulls you closer.  You feel her hooked claws gently press against your side...
>She quickly eases her grip when she notices this, and frowns slightly.

[FILE DOWN HER CLAWS]

>The three of you watch the film, Percy smiling and occasionally laughing the entire time.  She keeps pulling you closer and closer, only stopping when she feels her claws press against you.
>An idea occurs to you.
>"Hey... you want me to file your claws down a little?  So you don't worry about scratching me?"
>The cat thinks for a moment, then nods eagerly.  You gently rise up from the couch, with her reaching out towards you as you go.
>You grab a nail file from the bathroom and head back to the couch.  Percy has stopped watching the movie, and is obviously waiting for your return.  When you sit back down, she immediately wraps her arm around you.
>You carefully begin dulling her claws.  At first, she twitches and seems to consider pulling her hand away.  Then, she seems to enjoy it, and holds still.
>Eventually, you grind her claws down to a much more manageable state.  Percy tentatively squeezes you...
>You barely even feel her claws anymore.  She beams and pulls you as close to her as possible.
>You hand the file over to Pyr3, and she handles Percy's other claws.  Before long, she's fully manicured.  She gently leans over and scopes out your handiwork, then breaks into a broad smile.

[OFFER HER YOUR E-READER]

>Eventually, the movie ends.  Percy releases you and Pyr3, and grabs her whiteboard.
>VERY FUNNY, I LIKED IT
>Your red-furred girlfriend chuckles and pats the cat's head.
>"Y'kn0w, y0ur laugh really grew 0n me.  I th0ught it was a little weird at first, t0 be h0nest."
>IT IS ODD, A LITTLE
>As if to demonstrate, Percy lets off another chuckle.  She smiles proudly afterward.
>You get a strange thought...
>"So, you can write and read, right?"
>YES, TAUGHT MYSELF
>"How would you like my old e-reader?  You could read all kinds of stuff on it."
>REALLY?
>"Yep; I don't use it much, so I'd be happy to let you have it."
>She drops her board and marker, then moves in for a hug.  As usual, she stops herself just short.  You go ahead and meet her in the middle, with her hesitantly wrapping her arms around you.
>"Y'know, you don't have to be hesitant.  You can always just go for a hug.  I don't mind, do you, Pyr3?"
>"0f c0urse n0t!  Y0u can hug me whenever, Percy."
>She smiles, and some more tears drip from under her cap.  She tries to speak again.
>"GEH... KREH."
>Not understanding, you still nod anyway.

[SHOW HER HOW IT WORKS]

>You leave your friends for a moment, and dig around your room for that old e-reader.  Luckily, it's exactly where you thought it was, and it's even got the charge cable with it.
>You grab it and head back to the living room.  Unsurprisingly, Pyr3 and Percy are sitting on the couch, waiting and "chatting."
>You have a brief thought... what if you found some kinda text-to-speech program for her?  You'll keep that in mind.
>For now, you show off the reader and how to use it.  Surprisingly, she seems to pick up on it pretty quickly.
>You download a handful of novels for her, in various genres.  You also grab some books on nature.
>Percy smiles widely and hugs you, this time not hesitating.  Her soft, damp fur is oddly pleasant against your arms.
>She looks down at the e-reader in wonderment, and soon opens up one of the downloaded novels.  She quickly settles into her place on the couch, reading happily.
>"Whatcha reading?  Anything g00d?"
>Percy doesn't even seem to notice Pyr3; she's fully engrossed in her reading.  The skull-faced beast chuckles and shrugs it off.
>"Heheh, guess it must be s0mething interesting."

[KISS PYR3]

>You motion for Pyr3 to follow you into the kitchen, and the two of you leave your bookish friend to her reading.
>"She's ad0rable, An0n."
>"She is... it's a damn shame she had to go through... whatever happened in that lab."
>"Yeah, ab0ut that.  I did s0me digging, while we were there... It was cl0sed d0wn f0r ethics vi0lati0ns ages ag0."
>"How long do you think Percy was alone?"
>"If I were t0 guess... at least 10 years."
>You can't help but feel bad for your new friend.
>"...man, I'm glad we could get her out of there.  Let's make her some hot cocoa or something."
>You start making the warm drink, when suddenly Pyr3 hugs you close.
>"Hey... I want y0u t0 kn0w I'm pr0ud 0f h0w much y0u've d0ne f0r her.  That says a l0t ab0ut y0u."
>She kisses you, and holds you close.  Her fur, as always, is so warm and soft...
>The two of you only break apart when you need to check the hot chocolate.

[TALK]

>"I owe a lot of it to you, Pyr3.  You've really given me more confidence in myself.  Thanks to that, I felt like I could actually help her.  And... I'm glad it all worked out.  10 years of isolation... poor Percy."
>"Aww, y0u're still the best b0yfriend I c0uld have.  I'm glad she has a h0me here.  A wh0le decade, al0ne... n0t even c0unting g0d kn0ws h0w many years 0f experiments...."
>Pyr3 shudders and hugs you again.
>"Thank you.  Thank you for being here for me, and now for Percy.  I love you, Pyr3, and I hope you know that."
>She smiles broadly, then kisses you again.  You suddenly break the kiss when you hear wheezing.
>Percy is standing in the doorway of the kitchen, smiling and holding her whiteboard.
>HAVING FUN?
>She lets off that painful, raspy laugh.
>You and Pyr3 awkwardly separate, and the cat laughs even harder.
>SERIOUSLY THOUGH, WHAT'S THAT SMELL?
>You smile and hand her a cup of the hot chocolate you made.  She sniffs it tentatively, then shudders.
>NO THANK YOU
>You gently rub her head.
>"That's alright.  I just thought you may wanna try it."
>She simply holds up the same message again, and smiles apologetically.

[QUERY ABOUT READING]

>"Well, is there anything in particular you want to drink?"
>Percy thinks for a moment.
>MAYBE SOME MILK?
>Oh yeah.  She's a cat, right.
>"I think I can handle that."
>You pour her a glass, and she takes it gently, smiling.
>THANKS
>You and Pyr3 grab your mugs of cocoa, and the three of you clink your cups together.
>TO US!
>With that, Percy downs her drink in one long gulp.  The three of you then head back to the couch, and get cozy again.
>"Say, what b00k were y0u reading earlier?"
>AN ENCYCLOPEDIA OF MARINE LIFE
>Pyr3 frowns a little.
>"Y0u... actually read an encycl0pedia f0r FUN?"
>The fungus nods enthusiastically.
>I LIKE LEARNING NEW THINGS.  MAKES ME FEEL SMARTER.
>"Hey, fair en0ugh.  Enj0y y0ur reading, pal."
>THANK YOU, I WILL
>"You enjoying the e-reader?"
>YES, I LIKE IT, THANK YOU
>She grins and gives you a quick squeeze.

[LIE DOWN]

>Feeling cozy and a bit sleepy, you gently lay down across the girls' laps.  You rest your head in Pyr3's, and the rest of you is spread across Percy's.
>The cat looks ecstatic, and purrs loudly.  Pyr3 smiles warmly and runs a hand through your hair.
>"C0mfy?"
>You nod drowsily.
>"G00d.  Take a nap if y0u want; we'll just chill here."
>YES PLEASE FEEL FREE
>"You two won't get bored?"
>"Nah.  I've g0t the rem0te; I'll watch a m0vie."
>I'M GOING TO READ SOME MORE
>With that, you gently close your eyes.  As you drift off, you reflect on the last few days.
>In such a short timespan, you went from a lonely man to having two monster women hanging around with you.  One of them a sultry, customizable beast, the other a quiet, bookish fungal creature.
>You appreciated both of them, and you hoped they knew that.  They were both good people, regardless of being monstrous.
>A week or two ago, you'd have been terrified of them.  But now...
>You can't imagine seeing either one as frightening.
>With a smile, you start to doze off.

[CONTROL SHIFTING TO PYR3]

>She smiled and gently took her hand off his head.  Anon was fast asleep, his head lying in her lap.  Pyr3 turned her smile towards Percy, who continued to purr happily.
>"He's cute when he's asleep, huh?"
>YES VERY
>The catshroom smiled down at the sleeping Anon.
>NEVER SEEN A HUMAN WHO WASN'T AFRAID
>She tentatively reached a hand down and stroked his chest.  Almost immediately, she pulled her hand away.
>"Why d0 y0u d0 that?  The wh0le st0pping y0urself thing?"
>Percy looked a bit sheepish.
>NOT SURE HOW THIS WORKS
>"H0w what w0rks, affecti0n?"
>YES, THAT
>Percy put a hand to her chin in thought.
>SAW YOU TWO KISSING; ARE YOU IN LOVE?
>"Yeah... we are."
>THAT'S NICE.  YOU'RE BOTH SO NICE
>The cat gently hugged her red-furred friend, who slowly gained a mischievous grin.
>"Heh.  I bet y0u like An0n a l0t, huh?"
>WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
>"I bet... y0u want him t0 kiss y0u like that s0metime, huh?"
>Percy sputtered a bit, obviously flustered.  Pyr3 was sure she was blushing under that damp fur.
>"K-KEH..."
>Pyr3 grinned wider.
>"Heheh, I'm just teasing.  Y0u sure are cute when y0u're flustered th0ugh."
>I'M NOT
>Pyr3 couldn't help but chuckle at her friend's adamant denial.
>"0kay, if y0u say s0~"
>HE IS CUTE THOUGH
>"Yeah, that he is."
>The two monsters continued to chat for a while, with Pyr3 teasing her friend multiple times.

[PLAY A GAME]

>Pyr3 couldn't help but think of how to help Percy break out of her shell.  Thankfully, an input gave her the perfect idea...
>"I've g0t an idea: let's play a game."
>The cat immediately frowned slightly.
>WHAT KIND OF GAME?
>"Truth 0r dare."
>There was a pause, and Percy smiled.
>HOW DO I PLAY?
>"It's easy. I either ask y0u a questi0n, and y0u have t0 tell me the truth, 0r I dare y0u t0 d0 s0mething, and y0u have t0 d0 it.  Then, y0u d0 the same t0 me!"
>SOUNDS FUN!
>"Alright then... truth 0r dare?"
>Percy thought for a moment.
>DARE
>"G00d ch0ice~  I dare y0u t0... lick An0n's face."
>The cat gasped, and chuckled quietly.
>Slowly, ever so slowly, she leaned down.  She stuck her tongue out, and started to complete her task...
>Only to back out at the last second, giggling and shaking her head.
>CAN'T DO IT
>"What?  Y0u alm0st had it!  C'm0n, Percy... f0r me?"
>There was a pause, and Percy shrugged before leaning in again.
>This time, she gave Anon's face a quick lick before she lost her nerve.
>He shuddered a bit in his sleep, and she quickly started giggling.  She buried her face in her hands, her cheeks flushing.
>OKAY OKAY, I DID IT!
>"Heh, y0u sure did; g00d j0b.  N0w it's y0ur turn."
>OKAY, TRUTH OR DARE, PYRE?
>"Uh... 0ne thing, Percy: my name's spelled with a 3 instead 0f an E."
>The cat chuckled and wrote a smaller message beneath her current one.
>PICKY, PICKY
>Nonetheless, she corrected the mistake.

[DARE]

>"Think I'm g0nna g0 with dare."
>Percy smiled, and thought hard.  Eventually, her grin widened as she began to write.
>YOU'RE NOT A CAT, RIGHT?  I DARE YOU TO ACT LIKE ONE.
>"Heh.  Easy!  Watch this."
>Percy flinched when her friend's eyes went completely dark.  She shivered reflexively, and tentatively tapped Pyr3's shoulder.
>"KRREH?"
>Suddenly, the red beast came back into consciousness.  To her astonishment, Percy watched her friend change before her very eyes.
>Her long, wolflike snout shortened, as did her ears, which became pointed like Percy's own.  Her long claws became short and hooked.  Her bushy tail receded into a short stub.
>Pyr3... was a cat.
>She met her mushroom friend's gaze, and meowed playfully, winking.  Percy's jaw dropped as she heard Pyr3 begin to purr.
>She began fervently writing message after message, roughly erasing each one.
>HOW DID YOU DO THAT
>THAT'S AMAZING
>I CAN'T BELIEVE IT
>HOW
>HOW
>HOW
>Pyr3 gently grabbed Percy's hand.
>"Heheh!  It was simple: I can m0d myself!"
>REALLY?  THAT'S FASCINATING
>Pyr3 grinned, then reverted to her usual self.  The fungus gasped and tentatively reached out towards her.
>She carefully touched the tip of Pyr3's snout, and withdrew her hand with a gasp.
>WOW!  THANKS FOR SHOWING ME
>"N0 pr0blem.  Heheh."
>The two shared another friendly hug.

[EXPLAIN MODS]

>"Okay, my turn again.  Truth 0r dare?"
>Percy stared at her friend with a smile.
>I'M SORRY, WHAT?
>"Heheh, what's up, y0u thinking ab0ut s0mething?"
>SORRY, STILL AMAZED
>"What, my m0ds?"
>YES, VERY INTERESTING
>"Heh!  Wanna dr0p the game and just talk ab0ut em?"
>Percy nodded enthusiastically.
>"Alright then; whatcha want t0 kn0w?"
>WHAT CAN YOU CHANGE?
>"Everything ab0ut myself.  But... 0nly myself."
>ANYTHING?
>"Yep!  Fr0m eye c0l0r t0 height t0 the smell 0f my fur!"
>WOW!  DOES IT HURT?
>"N0pe!  Feels like changing cl0thes."
>HUH?
>"0h yeah.  Uh... feels like... hm.  Well, basically it d0esn't hurt."
>THAT'S GOOD.  IS IT FUN?
>"Heck yeah it's fun!  I l0ve it."
>GOOD!  DOES ANON KNOW?
>"Yeah, I t0ld him when we met."
>DOES HE LIKE IT?
>"Yep, he d0es."
>ME TOO; FASCINATING.  HOW DOES IT WORK?
>"Remember h0w I said I'm digital?"
>YES, AND I THINK I UNDERSTAND.
>"Wait, really?"
>YES; YOU ARE LIKE A LIVING PROGRAM.
>"That's... that's actually pretty much right!"
>Percy smiles proudly.
>"Y'kn0w, y0u're pretty smart, huh?"
>THANK YOU!
>The fungal feline hugged her friend tightly, purring loudly.
>"Heheh.  Getting m0re c0mf0rtable with hugs?  That's great, Percy."
>Pyr3 patted her friend atop her squishy head.

[TALK]

>MUST BE NICE, BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THINGS
>"Huh?  Yeah, it's fun t0 mess ar0und with.  But... I like this l00k best."
>IT'S A NICE LOOK.
>"Heh, thanks.  ...y'kn0w, it's funny.  Y0u and An0n seem s0 amazed with my m0dding stuff, and yet... y0u b0th like me as I am n0rmally."
>OF COURSE I DO; YOU'RE MY FRIEND
>"Y0u're s0 sweet.  I kinda envy y0u guys, a little.  Y0u've g0t 0ne f0rm, and that's all y0u have t0 w0rry ab0ut.  N0 m0ds t0 keep up with, n0 need t0 w0rry ab0ut matching s0me0ne's preferences..."
>WHAT?  WHY WORRY?
>"Heh... it's a l0ng st0ry.  D0n't sweat it."
>I UNDERSTAND.  THE PAST IS HARD TO THINK ABOUT.
>"Amen, sister.  Y0u're pretty intellectual, f0r s0me0ne wh0 spent ten years in a lab."
>30
>"...huh?"
>30 YEARS
>"I thought..."
>10 ALONE, BUT 30 TOTAL
>"...30 years in that awful lab."
>Percy sighed deeply.
>YES.
>Pyr3 couldn't help but get a little emotional.  She hugged her friend tightly.
>"Y0u p00r thing.  I'm s0 glad we g0t y0u 0ut 0f there."
>ME TOO.  AT LEAST I LEARNED MANY THINGS WHEN THEY LEFT.
>"Yeah, y0u need t0 l00k 0n the bright side 0f stuff like that.  L00k at h0w smart y0u are n0w, and be pr0ud."
>THANK YOU, PYR3.
>Black tears dripped from under Percy's cap.  Pyr3 couldn't help it anymore.  She let a few tears of her own drip, and pulled Percy into a tight, supportive embrace.

[CONTROL SHIFTING TO ANON]

>You smile in your "sleep."
>You were napping peacefully until you felt something wet and rough across your face.  You cracked an eye and saw that it was Percy, licking you.
>Since then, you pretended to be asleep, listening to the two open up to one another.
>It was adorable how excited Percy was about Pyr3's modding skills.  And you were shocked to hear that Pyr3 envied you, of all people.
>You're just happy that the two are getting along swimmingly.
>You've been waiting for the perfect opportunity to "wake up," and now's the time.
>You suddenly sit up, and both girls gasp.
>You then silently pull them into a hug.  Percy purrs loudly and gently squeezes you.  Pyr3's claws gently rest against your back.
>The three of you simply enjoy each other's company for a while, smiling and holding your embrace.
>Pyr3 winks at you.
>"H0w l0ng have y0u been awake, huh?"
>"Since Percy licked me."
>The cat lets out an embarrassed giggle, and tries to hide her face.
>"Heheh, th0ught that might be it.  Y0u sneak, letting us think y0u were still asleep!"
>She puts on an exaggerated look of outrage, then almost immediately returns to her usual grin.

[TIME FOR BED]

>You glance over at the clock, and realize it's getting rather late.  As if on cue, Percy yawns cutely.
>I'M TIRED...
>"Yeah, me t00.  It's been a busy day."
>"Yeah, we should probably get ready for bed.  Tomorrow we gotta actually run those errands we were supposed to do today."
>CAN I COME?
>"Uh... I'll see what I can do about that."
>Percy grins widely, and yawns again.
>"You can share the bed with Pyr3 and I if you want, Percy."
>She puts a hand to her chin for a moment.
>THINK I'LL SLEEP HERE, THANK YOU
>"Alright then; if you need something don't be afraid to wake us up.  Goodnight."
>GOODNIGHT ANON, GOODNIGHT PYR3
>"G00dnight Percy!"
>With that, you rise up from the couch and start getting ready for bed.  By the time you get changed into your bedclothes, Pyr3 is already lounging across the bed.
>"N0t a bad day at all.  We helped s0me0ne wh0 really needed it."
>"Yep, I'm glad we could help her.  G'night Pyr3..."
>You lie down next to the crimson beast, and she cuddles you close.  She throws an arm across your middle, and is soon snoring quietly.
>It's not long at all before you feel yourself falling asleep.  You sink into warmth and comfort, and drift out of consciousness.

[HAVE A GOOD MORNING]

>You awaken from a restful, uneventful sleep to find your vision filled by furry cleavage.
>Your face is wedged snugly between Pyr3's breasts.  The smell of cinnamon is intoxicating, and the softness of her fur is heavenly...
>You can't tell if she's awake or not, so you simply enjoy your position quietly.  Suddenly, you hear her chuckle.
>"Having fun d0wn there~?"
>You sheepishly pull yourself out of her cleavage, and move up towards her face.  A seductive grin is plastered across her skull.
>"C0mfy in there, huh~?"
>You nod, blushing.  She leans in and kisses you.
>"Let's just enj0y this f0r a while, huh?  Just cuddle f0r a bit."
>"Sounds good to me."
>You wrap an arm around her furry midsection and pull her closer.  She gently strokes your cheek with one hand...
>And you feel the other slyly slide down your pants.  Her grin gets considerably more wicked as she gets to work.
>She grabs your already-erect member, and slowly, tantalizing runs her hand up and down the length of it.
>It's not long at all before she finishes you off, never losing that grin or mischievous spark in her eye.  She giggles teasingly as she withdraws her hand and licks her fingers clean.
>You lean forward and kiss her passionately, only stopping when you hear a tentative scratch at the door.
>"GERK?"
>"Uh, one minute, Percy!"

[CLEAN UP]

>You can hear Percy waiting patiently, and start to answer the door, when you remember what just happened.  You whisper to Pyr3.
>"I can't let her in now, I-I haven't gotten cleaned up yet!"
>"Huh?  0h, lemme handle that~"
>You sit on the edge of the bed, and Pyr3 quickly yanks your boxers down in one fluid motion.  With a wink, she quickly licks you totally clean.
>As soon as she's done, you redress yourself and open the door.  Percy stands with a sheepish smile, holding her whiteboard.
>CAN I COME IN?
>"Yeah, of course."
>She tentatively steps into your room, looking around curiously.  Eventually, she sits on your bed.
>OOH, COMFY
>"Isn't it?  An0n's g0t a nice place."
>YES, THE COUCH WAS COMFY TOO
>"Did you sleep well?"
>BETTER THAN I EVER HAVE
>"That's great, Percy.  I'm happy for you."
>She immediately springs up from the bed and hugs you tightly.  Pyr3 soon joins in.
>"Needed s0me m0rning cuddles?  That's fine, heheh.  An0n did t00~"
>She winks at you, and you attempt to hide your blush.  Percy merely looks a bit confused.

[TICKLE]

>When the group hug breaks apart, you still find yourself blushing.  To hide your embarrassment, you hatch a plan...
>You immediately begin tickling Percy wildly.  She flinches at first, but soon breaks into stifled giggles.
>She tries to write something, but soon drops her whiteboard and bursts into slow, raspy laughter.
>Pyr3 winks and joins in on your onslaught.  Percy's laughter intensifies, to the point that she's practically wheezing.
>A bit concerned, you stop tickling her; Pyr3 does the same.  The fungus slowly regains her composure, still smiling broadly.
>She stoops down to pick up her writing utensils.
>YOU GUYS ARE SILLY
>"Heh, I'm n0t g0nna argue with that."
>"Me neither."
>You gently pat Percy's cap, sending her into quiet purring.  At the same time, Pyr3 moves in and hugs her again.  Percy looks to be in absolute bliss, and her purring intensifies.

[HAVE BREAKFAST]

>Cat successfully cuddled, you head into the kitchen to make some breakfast.
>"Alright, what do you two want?  Bacon and eggs sound good?"
>"Yeah, that s0unds g00d."
>I'M FINE WITH ANY FOOD
>With a smile, you set about fixing a hearty breakfast.  While everything cooks, you chat with the ladies.
>"So... today I gotta run some errands.  Percy, I... don't think I can take you along.  Sorry."
>She looks obviously disappointed, but still writes:
>THAT'S OKAY.  I'LL WAIT HERE.
>Pyr3 lays a hand on the mushroom's shoulder.
>"Hey, I'll stay here with y0u.  N0 sense in making y0u stay here al0ne."
>THANKS, PYR3!
>Percy's stubby tail twitches happily, and she grins.
>"N0 pr0blem."
>"While I'm out, I'll see if I can find some good spots we could take you, Percy.  Places where there won't be many people to hide you from."
>SOUNDS GOOD TO ME, THANKS
>You smile, and check the food.  Everything's done, so you serve up breakfast, pouring Percy a glass of milk while you're at it.
>As usual, Pyr3 ravenously devours her food in no time flat.  Percy very slowly picks at her food, despite clearly enjoying it.
>IT'S GREAT; YOU'RE A GOOD COOK
>"Thanks; it's a hobby."
>GOOD HOBBY
>She chuckles a little, and takes a sip of her drink.

[QUERY ON A DISGUISE]

>You smile warmly at Percy, who continues to whittle away at her breakfast.
>A thought comes to mind...
>"Hey Pyr3... can you maybe... make it so people see her as a normal human?"
>She looks genuinely thoughtful.
>"I... I d0n't kn0w.  I've never g0tten a m0d t0 affect things 0ther than myself.  MAYBE I c0uld change percepti0n, but they'd still smell her sweetness, feel her fur, and all that.  Even then... I dunn0 if I can even change percepti0n..."
>"Huh.  Alright, we'll keep that in mind.  I know you two are gonna stay here while I run errands, right?"
>YES, WE'LL WAIT
>"Yeah, I d0n't mind chilling here f0r a while."
>"Great.  Percy, take all the time you need for breakfast; I'm gonna go get dressed and head out.  The sooner I leave, the sooner I can get home."
>SOUNDS GOOD
>You smile at the two ladies, and they return the gesture.  Percy's fangs glint a bit in the light.
>"While I'm out, I'll see what I can find for a disguise.  JUUUST in case Pyr3 can't cloak you."
>"0h, g00d call.  Always g00d t0 have a backup plan."
>I AGREE. GOOD IDEA, ANON
>...you vaguely wonder if Percy would be done eating by now if she didn't keep stopping to write messages.

[GO SHOPPING]

>When breakfast is finally over, you bid the ladies farewell and head out to get your shopping done.
>You run through a quick mental checklist:
>Groceries, something to disguise Percy...
>Hm.  On the topic of her, you consider looking into getting her a pet or something.  Maybe an aquarium, given that she seems to have some interest in marine life?
>Still thinking, you wander into the grocery store.  You quickly fill your cart with various foodstuffs.  Meat, eggs, milk... all that jazz.
>You head up to the checkout, and are immediately met with the smiling cashier.
>She's pretty cute, and that wink suggests she knows it.
>You smile back at her, and make an effort to get through the transaction without any flirting.
>...you do sneak a glance down her shirt, though.  Luckily it seems that she didn't notice.
>"There you go!  Have a nice day, handsome."
>She winks again.  You're fairly certain she's undressing you with her eyes...
>With that, you make your way back to the car.  You set the groceries in the backseat, and something catches your eye.
>Your seat is full of little mushrooms.
>You figure they must have fallen off of Percy when you brought her home.
>Hm.

[DISREGARD MUSHROOMS]

>A small wellspring of worry floods your mind.  
>Percy said that her spores only affect cats, so you're not afraid of getting sick.  But...
>You also don't really want some unidentifiable fungus getting out into the wild.
>...a very worrying desire to eat some of the mushrooms slowly makes its way to the forefront of your consciousness.  You start to notice that they emit the same sweet smell as Percy herself...
>You violently shake your head to clear your thoughts.  You'll clean up the seats later.  For now, you'll ignore the fungi.
>You make your way to a local clothing store, hoping to find something to disguise your feline friend with.
>As soon as you enter, your eyes immediately fall on the perfect solution: a massively oversized hoodie.
>You snatch it up quickly, and set out to find more components to a good disguise.
>As you walk around, you bump into an employee.
>"Can I help you find anything?"
>"Uh... yeah, actually.  My... cousin... is super shy, and I'm trying to find some stuff to help her stay concealed in public."
>"Oh, uh... alright then?  Maybe... maybe a scarf could help with that?"
>He seems extremely confused, but at least he flits around the store, helping you find stuff.  You'll be sure to give him a little tip later.

[HEAD HOME]

>After a fair amount of shopping, you finally assemble the perfect disguise for your "cousin."  The confused employee smiles and waves as you head to the car with a hoodie, a scarf, a pair of sweatpants, a hat, and some sunglasses.
>You'll admit the last part is mainly for the absurdity of someone with no eyes wearing shades.
>When you get to the car, you eye up those mushrooms again...
>You'll round them up and show them to Percy when you get home.  Surely she'll know what to do with them.
>With your car loaded down with supplies, you finally head home.  You wonder idly what the girls got up to while you were out...

>When you get into the living room, Pyr3 is asleep on the floor, lying on her stomach.  Percy is sitting atop her back, reading her e-reader peacefully.
>The smell of burnt food and the crumbs in your floor suggest that one of the two got hungry while you were out.
>The TV is showing an episode of How It's Made; Percy occasionally looks up from her reading to watch the show, nodding and smiling.
>The cat eventually notices your presence.  She waves, and you hear her purr.  She holds up her whiteboard.
>PYR3 GOT SLEEPY
>Percy stifles a laugh, and gestures down at the snoozing Pyr3.

[HEAD TO THE KITCHEN]

>You quietly walk over to Percy and gently pat her cap.  She smiles warmly, and carefully rises from her place.  Pyr3 continues to snooze, snoring loudly.
>You make your way to the kitchen, Percy following you closely.  You hand her the bag of clothes you bought, and she looks into it with obvious interest.
>You can't help but let out a gasp when you see the kitchen.
>It's an absolute nightmare.  The walls around your stove are coated in some unidentifiable stains.  The whole room smells of smoke and... something sweet?  Several cookbooks lie around, open to apparently random pages.
>Your utensils are scattered around with no rhyme or reason.  
>A pot simmers atop the stove, with a lid clamped firmly atop it.  You're frankly terrified as to what it could even be.
>Percy taps your shoulder.  You turn, and see...
>The sunglasses precariously balanced on her cap's brim.  She smiles proudly, her tongue poking out ever-so-slightly.
>She looks so goofy and adorable you can't help but laugh.  She giggles as well, and the two of you hug.
>Once the hug ends, she holds up another bag.  You recognize it as the one you filled with the mushrooms she left behind.  She sets the bag down and writes on her whiteboard.
>THESE ARE MINE, AREN'T THEY?
>"Yep, found them in the car."
>SORRY, SOMETIMES I SHED THEM.
>"It's okay.  Are they... safe?"
>She grins a little.
>THEY'RE MOSTLY HARMLESS, ESPECIALLY TO HUMANS.  I'M JUST NOT SURE IF EATING THEM IS A GOOD IDEA.
>"Yeah, I, uh... I didn't plan on it."
>She laughs again, a bit louder this time.

[SEE WHAT'S COOKING]

>You and Percy begin putting the groceries away.  She seems to enjoy helping you, as she smiles the entire time.
>Before long, everything is put away properly.  You make sure she's not watching, then turn on your stove's vent hood.
>"So, uh... what's cooking?"
>DECIDED TO MAKE MYSELF LUNCH
>"Oh yeah?  Whatcha making?"
>WELL...
>She leads you over to the stove, and motions for you to open the pot.
>You'd REALLY rather not, but her look of pride is too adorable to resist.
>You cautiously open the lid...
>And are absolutely stunned to find that the contents are nothing more than a handful of brightly colored mushrooms floating in a rather... sickly looking stew.
>Percy beams with pride at her handiwork.
>I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD EAT THAT, BUT IT WON'T BOTHER ME
>"Percy, are those... yours?"
>YES, I HAD TO GET CREATIVE.
>"Oh... w-why's that?"
>WASN'T REALLY SURE WHAT'S WHAT IN THE FRIDGE.  I KNOW MY MUSHROOMS, THOUGH.
>"I... expect you do."
>Again, she laughs.  Her sunglasses nearly fall off, and she frantically fixes their positioning.

[TRY HER COOKING]

>Try as you might, you can't avert your eyes from Percy's cooking.  She continues to smile widely.
>"Is it... is it safe for me to try it?"
>YES, SHOULD BE, BUT YOU MAY DISLIKE THE TASTE
>"Second question: are these safe for YOU to eat?  You said your spores affected cats, and you're a cat..."
>She scoffs and waves a hand dismissively.
>THEY GREW ON ME; THEY WON'T HURT ME.
>Then, she writes something that both makes you pity her... and sends a chill down your spine.
>BESIDES: I'VE EATEN THEM BEFORE
>...even though they're apparently not PART of her, something about these mushrooms growing off of her... weirds you out.  
>Nonetheless, you steel your nerves and taste a spoonful of the stew.  Percy looks positively ecstatic.
>The taste is... absolutely bizarre.  Nigh indescribable, even.  If you could sum it up in a few words...
>It tastes like the cheapest cough syrup ever.
>...you shake your head to clear it.  The cloyingly sweet, yet unmistakably bitter taste lingers in your mouth.  Percy is practically shaking with anticipation.
>HOW WAS IT?
>"Uh... I can honestly say it has a one-of-a-kind flavor."
>She purrs loudly and hugs you tightly.
>THANK YOU FOR TRYING IT!
>"N-no problem...  I gotta say, I'm proud of you trying new things, Percy.  Keep it up."
>You make a mental note to keep encouraging her creativity.  She seems to have so much curiosity to sate; why not support it?
>Good thing you bought some art supplies at the store.  You idly wonder what sort of things she'd draw...

[OFFER COOKING LESSONS]

>...more than that, you wonder what she could cook with some help?
>"Hey, Percy... want me to help you next time you want to cook?"
>She beams, and her tail twitches.
>YES PLEASE, THAT WOULD BE NICE
>I LOVE LEARNING NEW THINGS
>You chuckle and pat her cap gently.  As soon as she starts purring, you pull her into a warm hug.  With almost no hesitation, she wraps her arms around you as well.
>You can't quite get over what an oddly pleasant feeling her hugs are.  Between her spongy skin, damp fur, and the soft rumble of her purring, it's definitely a unique experience.
>"Hey, thanks for sharing your food with me.  That's really sweet of you."
>Apparently not wanting to let go just yet, Percy attempts to speak.
>"KKREH... GREK."
>She looks a bit embarrassed... then releases you and writes out what you assume she wanted to say.
>NO PROBLEM, THEY GROW BACK
>You gently pat her cap again.
>"Regardless, thanks."
>She flashes another fanged smile your way.

[CHECK ON PYR3]

>You carefully ladle out a bowl of the stew for Percy... and one for yourself.  Might as well; doesn't seem to have affected you in any noticeable way.
>Percy carefully laps up a bit of her own cooking, then smiles happily.
>WOW, SO MUCH BETTER COOKED
>"Yeah.. I actually kinda like it myself.  I'm gonna see if Pyr3 wants to try some of this."
>You head back into the living room, where the crimson-furred monster is slowly rising up from the floor.
>"Mm?  W-what happen?  Did I d0ze 0ff?"
>"Ha, yeah, Percy said you fell asleep."
>Pyr3 smiles sheepishly.
>"Heheh... uh, that's n0t usually my style.  S0rry I fell asleep when I was supp0sed t0 be watching Percy.  Speaking 0f, where is 0l' shr00mcat?"
>"In the kitchen; she made lunch."
>"0h, that's gr- wait, what?  She... she c00ked lunch?"
>"Yeah, and it's actually not bad?"
>"Huh!  Whaddya kn0w."
>Pyr3 makes her way into the kitchen, and you follow suit.
>She looks down into the pot of stew with obvious concern.  She leans over close to you when Percy isn't looking.
>"...what is this stuff?"
>"They're her mushrooms.  They're safe."
>"Uhh... alright then."
>You dip Pyr3 a bowl of the stew, and she takes it over to the table.  Percy watches her with mounting excitement, and you quietly begin cleaning up the kitchen a bit.
>You decide to cook some proper lunch after cleaning up.  Mushrooms aren't that filling, after all.
>Of course... you've got quite a cleanup to do.

[SHOW PERCY HOW TO COOK]

>It takes nearly an hour, but you get the kitchen cleaned up.  The only real problem is some claw marks on your cookbooks...
>Ah well.  You can't be mad at that adorable face.  Even now, Percy is still smiling proudly,
>Pyr3 walks past you and whispers into your ear.
>"I'm s0rry, but... I hated her c00king.  I ate it th0ugh.  I can't hurt her feelings."
>You merely nod and walk over to Percy.
>"Say... you wanna help me cook some fish to go along with your mushrooms?"
>She practically vibrates with excitement.
>YES PLEASE
>You chuckle and pat her cap again, then lead her to the counter.
>As you prepare the fish, she watches carefully.  Surprisingly, she seems to tone her excitement down considerably, focusing entirely on watching your methods.
>Occasionally, she writes a question out, then returns to watching you.
>WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THE BONES?
>DO YOU SEASON IT BEFORE OR AFTER COOKING?
>You answer all her questions when they come, and she nods appreciatively each time.
>Near the end, Pyr3 drifts over.
>"00h, l00ks like y0u tw0 have s0mething g00d g0ing 0n here!  Having fun, Percy?"
>YES, A LOT OF FUN
>Pyr3 hugs her tightly for a moment, then heads back to her seat at the table.
>Eventually, you finish prepping the fish.  Percy purrs loudly as you start cooking them.
>THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME THAT!
>"No problem."
>With almost no hesitation, she wraps her arms around you, purring.

[COOK AND CUDDLE]

>You're usually pretty handy in the kitchen.  It doesn't normally take that long to get a meal started.
>Of course, normally you have the use of both arms.
>Right now, you're keeping one arm wrapped firmly around Percy.
>The shroomcat continues to purr and snuggle against you adorably.  You pat her back and her cap alternately, and she seems to really appreciate it.
>Meanwhile, you attempt to get the fish cooking with your free hand.  It's... not easy.
>Eventually though, after nearly double the usual time it takes, you finally have the fish cooking.  Percy finally releases you, smiling sheepishly.
>I WASN'T IN THE WAY, WAS I?
>"Of course not.  You're fine."
>You pat her squishy cap again, and her tail and ears twitch madly.
>THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME WATCH
>"No problem.  Maybe sometime you can try cooking some."
>SOUNDS FUN
>Pyr3 grimaces at the thought; thankfully Percy doesn't notice.

[TAKE A NAP]

>You take a seat at the table, and the three of you chat and kill time until the fish is done.
>When you serve it up, Pyr3 quickly scarfs her portion down in no time.  You eat at a more moderate pace.
>Percy puts a hand to her chin in thought, then tentatively dips part of her fish into what's left of the mushroom stew she made.
>Pyr3 cringes, but apparently the experiment was a rousing success for Percy.  She grins widely and proceeds to dip every bit of her food in the fungal concoction.
>You can't help but smile at her sheer happiness with her work.

>...eventually, the shroomcat finishes eating.  She slowly rises from her chair, stretching and yawning.
>"Sleepy?"
>A LITTLE
>Pyr3 smiles, and yawns herself.
>"Yeah... I c0uld g0 f0r an0ther nap myself, actually."
>"You just woke up, Pyr3!"
>She playfully punches your shoulder, and Percy gasps.
>DON'T HURT HIM!
>She runs over to you and wraps around you protectively.
>"Take it easy, I'm n0t g0nna hurt him.  It was a j0ke."
>The cat slowly releases her grip on you, and steps away.
>OH, OKAY...
>She looks obviously confused, then yawns again.
>"C'mon, let's take a quick nap, and we'll head out on a walk later."
>"S0unds g00d..."
>The three of you make your way to the couch, and get cozy.  Pyr3 lays an arm across your shoulders, while Percy snuggles her head up against you.
>It's not long at all before you slip into warm, comfortable sleep.

[DREAM]

>...you dream about, what else, the ladies.  Perhaps because of the cinnamon scent, your dreams are again wintery in theme.
>Pyr3 stands above you, grinning wickedly with a massive snowball in hand.  Panicked, you quickly push her over.
>She lets out an exaggerated NOOOOOO as she slooowly falls backwards into a snowdrift.
>The sheer force of her landing sprays snow everywhere.
>...including all over you.  There's a pause, then she sits up and clocks you with the snowball anyway.
>She cackles with glee as you wipe the snow off your face.  Then, she steps forwards, pulling you into an embrace.
>Suddenly, a sound cuts through the air:
>It sounds almost like... a cat yowling.
>Out of nowhere, Percy pops up from inside a pile of snow, a reindeer horn headband stretched awkwardly across her cap.  She hurls handful after handful of snow at both you and Pyr3.
>As you suffer the onslaught, you and Pyr3 laugh playfully.  The shroomcat also laughs, in her usual slow, raspy way.
>She finally runs out of ammo.  She continues laughing as she leans against a nearby tree...
>Only for said tree to dump a massive pile of snow directly on top of her.
>Everyone laughs, and the snowball fight continues...

[WAKE UP]

>...eventually, the fight comes to a stop.
>The three of you join hands in a truce, and suddenly find yourselves floating through the snowy sky.
>You look around in wonder at the falling snow; it seems to come to a stop just for the sake of your observation.
>Reflected in the ice crystals, with stunning clarity, are your faces.  Human, skull-beast, and shroomcat.  All shown brilliantly in each crystal of each snowflake.
>It's truly a gorgeous sight.
>Suddenly, Pyr3 and Percy pull you close.  The three of you share a warm, cozy embrace for what feels like years.
>The snow remains still around you, reflecting your mutual love for one another.
>The sheer comfort you feel is immeasurable.
>Eventually, you slowly fall to the ground.  Upon landing, the three of you begin making snow angels.
>You find that your head is resting on a pleasantly soft snowdrift...

>...you awaken to find your head laying comfortably on Pyr3's plush ass.
>You quickly assess the situation:
>The three of you somehow ended up in the floor.  Pyr3 is asleep on her stomach, snoring.
>As you already know, you are resting on your back, with your head on her rear.  For a moment, you are unable to find Percy.
>Then, you notice the purring, and a weight atop your chest.
>Percy is curled up on top of you, sleeping peacefully.  The tags in her ear glint in the light, and her tail twitches occasionally.
>You are extremely comfortable, even despite Percy's weight atop you.

[DO NOT DISTURB]

>Seeing as you're comfortable, and they're still asleep, you see no need to disturb the current situation.
>You merely lay your head back down on Pyr3's supple, firm backside.
>The soft, lush fur feels wonderful against the back of your neck.  Her steady breathing assures you that she's sleeping soundly.
>The dim light dances off of her skull in an almost ethereal manner.  It's quite a beautiful sight, in an odd way.
>You take a deep breath, taking in the warm, comforting scent of cinnamon.  Pyr3 unconsciously drapes her tail across your face.
>Meanwhile, Percy unconsciously adjusts her position, her claws gently grabbing your shirt as she does so.
>She smiles in her sleep, and her purring never ceases.
>As she lays there, she occasionally rubs her head against your chest, her ears twitching.  You're tempted to stroke her cap, but think better of it.  You don't want to wake her.
>Considering that she's a tad taller than you, Percy isn't all that heavy.  You suppose that's due to her decade of isolation.  She can't have eaten well, trapped in that lab.
>You make it a point to keep taking care of her, as well as Pyr3.

[KISS THE BUTT]

>Being extra careful not to wake either of the two up, you crane your neck around to get a good view of your makeshift pillow.
>While Pyr3's prodigious bust is perhaps the most immediately notable part of her, you must admit she also has quite a bit going on back here.
>Her firm, inviting ass causes your mouth to water a bit.
>...you give in to some deep part of your psyche and plant a kiss on one of her red-furred cheeks.
>She doesn't appear to notice, thankfully.
>However...
>With a yawn, Percy awakens.
>She rises onto all fours, still atop you, and stretches much like an ordinary cat.
>She smiles at you drowsily, and begins to gently knead your chest with her hands.
>She soon stops and makes her way off of you.
>Though she's rather light, you still breathe a sigh of relief when her weight is lifted.
>She walks around to Pyr3's face and stoops down.  When she sees that the skull-headed monster is still asleep, she smiles again, then quietly walks over and takes a seat on the couch.
>You gently raise up...
>And are immediately met with a gasp as Pyr3 jerks awake.
>"H-huh?  0h, uh... m0rning, y0u guys."
>She looks over her shoulder and sees where you're laying.  A wicked grin spreads across her skull.
>"C0mfy, An0n?  Heheh."
>You can't help but blush a little.
>"Yeah... uh, thanks..."
>Pyr3 winks at you with another crooked grin.

[GET SUGGESTIONS ON WHAT TO DO]

>You stand up and stretch.  Pyr3 follows suit, yawning.
>"What a g00d nap.  Whatcha want t0 d0 n0w, An0n?"
>"I was about to ask you two the same thing.  Percy?  Any suggestions?"
>She seems to think for a moment.
>MAYBE A WALK?
>"I've got just the place in mind... the woods."
>Pyr3's golden eyes light up.
>"Are they g00d and sp00ky w00ds?"
>"Yup."
>"Awes0me."
>SOUNDS FUN
>"...you'll probably have to wear that disguise I got you, Percy."
>UNDERSTOOD
>She quickly walks into the kitchen to change into the clothes.
>Pyr3 grins as she walks away.
>"I think she'll like this.  Getting 0ut is g00d f0r y0u."
>Soon, the shroomcat returns.
>It's... it's by no means a perfect disguise, but it'll do.  The hoodie covers most of her body, and the hat you bought covers a fair amount of her cap.
>The sunglasses were mainly a joke; the scarf covers her face.  The sweatpants don't seem to fit too well, but at least they conceal her legs.
>"Are you comfortable in all that?"
>IT'S NOT BAD, I GUESS
>"Well, sorry you have to wear it."
>IT'S FINE.  DON'T WANT TO GET CAUGHT

[SUGGEST A PICNIC]

>"Hey, I've got an idea: let's make this into a picnic."
>"S0unds g00d t0 me!"
>You head into the kitchen and start making some sandwiches.  Percy hovers over your shoulder the whole time, watching.
>After you make enough for a respectable lunch, you start packing a basket.  You glance over your shoulder to see Percy experimentally taking out two slices of bread.
>She reaches into her hoodie, carefully breaks off a mushroom growing on her shoulder, then makes herself a sandwich.  (Literally, you suppose.)
>The cat takes a tentative bite of her creation, then grins at you.
>NOT BAD
>It's... a little odd that she's so willing to eat what you assume are parts of her.
>You disregard this thought, pat her cap, and resume packing.
>Once everything's set, the three of you head out.
>The old woods aren't too far from your house, but you decide to drive there anyway.  That way there's less chance of Percy getting caught.
>You and Pyr3 get into the car, with her shrinking down as usual.
>Percy tentatively crawls into the backseat, carrying her mushroom sandwich in her mouth.
>Eventually, she settles in and you head out.

[REGALE THEM WITH A STORY]

>When you arrive at the entrance to the woods, the clouds roll in.
>The once-warm daylight cools to a smooth indigo.
>The rain begins to fall.  Not a downpour, but a light drizzle.  The kind of rain that taps on the leaves of the trees, but never makes it to the forest floor.
>The three of you dash into the woods, escaping the drizzle.
>A very singular mood strikes you.  You pull out your phone and play the appropriate music.
[https://youtu.be/0dYPYAMxviw]
>The vaguely nostalgic, chill music washes over you and your companions as you walk down the old trail.
>Percy in particular seems to enjoy the sound, gently swaying to the beat as she walks.
>The atmosphere has you wanting to recount some of the old stories you've heard about these woods.
>"They say that these woods have a mind of their own.  If you ignore your own sense of direction and just follow the sound of the leaves, they say you'll find that mind."
>"I'm n0t g0nna lie: that s0unds like bull."
>You shrug.
>"That's just what I've heard.  Supposedly some people have vanished looking for the mind of the woods..."
>Pyr3 grins, presumably enjoying the story, but Percy shivers a bit.
>SOUNDS SCARY...
>"Aww, it's n0t true, just s0me st0ry An0n heard."

[CONTINUE]

>"Hey: you never know.  It could be true.  Remember what happened last time I told you about a rumor I heard?"
>"Yeah, yeah... g00d p0int."
>WHAT RUMOR?
>"Uh... well..."
>Percy frowns a little.
>WAS IT ABOUT ME?
>"...yes.  Your breathing, to be specific."
>She looks a bit sad for a moment, but soon shakes it off.
>I DON'T CARE; I'M GLAD YOU FOUND ME
>"Me too, Percy."
>The three of you share a hug, and the rain promptly intensifies.  You rush off to a nearby rock formation; luckily there's a large nook you can get into.
>Once you're safe from the rain, the three of you sit down, still listening to the music and the raindrops hitting the leaves.
>SO PEACEFUL OUT HERE
>"Yeah, it's nice to get out and about sometimes."
>I HOPE THAT RUMOR ISN'T TRUE
>"Hey, if it is, we'll keep y0u safe."
>THANKS!
>Pyr3 hugs the fungal feline close, and her purring joins the rain and music in a comforting harmony.

[EXAMINE SURROUNDINGS]
GAME SAVED

>After what feels like three days of doing nothing, you suddenly shake off the trance the rain seems to have put you in.
>Pyr3 and Percy are still hugging.  You walk over and pat their heads affectionately.  You can't help but think about how bizarre it is to feel both hard bone and soft mushroom cap within seconds of each other.
>The girls smile appreciatively.
>As you watch the rain, you think about checking your supplies...
>You've got your trusty Swiss Army Knife, some blankets for a picnic, some food, your cellphone, and a flashlight.  Not much, but enough for these woods.
>You also decide to look around the little nook you've found yourself in.
>Nothing out of the ordinary strikes you, barring what seem to be scrape marks against the rocks.  They're rather high up... 
>Maybe someone climbed up and made them?
>As you look, you follow your internal compass and head north.
>...only to hit a dead end.  The nook isn't particularly deep.  Basically, it's only large enough to fit the three of you.
>You do notice more of those scrapes on this wall.  Again, they're pretty high up...

[HAVE LUNCH]

>You puzzle over those scrape marks for a while, only stopping when your stomach growls.
>Well, can't argue with that.
>You quickly unpack the picnic lunch, blankets and all.  The three of you sit down on the rocky floor, with only the blankets cushioning you.
>You didn't pack much, just some sandwiches and chips.  You dole out some food to each of the girls, then rip open a bag of chips for yourself.
>Percy eyes up a turkey sandwich, and nonchalantly plucks another mushroom off of herself.  She adds it to the sandwich and takes a hearty bite, purring and smiling.
>Pyr3 grimaces.
>"H0w d0 y0u just... EAT parts 0f y0urself?"
>Percy shrugs.
>THEY GROW BACK
>"Uh... 0kay, fair en0ugh, I guess?"
>After that discussion, lunch continues with no real hitches.
>Once everyone finishes eating, you can't help but eye up those scrapes again.  Pyr3 looks up at them with you.
>"Climb up there; we'll catch y0u if y0u fall."
>You're not much of a rock climber, but you decide to scale the walls anyway.
>When you reach the scrapes, you can't help but notice something...
>They almost look like... crude numbering?  Who would be writing down tally marks 15 feet up...?

[WRITE DOWN THE NUMBERS]

>These tally marks MUST mean something.  Surely...?
>"Hey, one of you remember these numbers: 19, 21, 13."
>There's a pause.
>"0kay!  We g0t it."
>With that, you climb back down.  Percy has written the numbers on her whiteboard, and is staring down at them thoughtfully.
>"I saw some on the north wall too.  Lemme see what they are."
>You carefully climb the north wall, and grab those numbers as well.
>"14, 5, 18."
>"G0t em!"
>You climb back down.  
>Hmm.  You can't think of any particular meaning to those numbers...
>Pyr3 stares down at them for a while, then sighs and rubs her bony temples.
>"I d0n't kn0w.  I'm sure there's s0mething t0 this, but I'm stumped."
>Percy starts to write something, but doesn't have room on her board.  She huffs in frustration, and tries to speak instead.
>"KEH... GREH."
>"...I don't follow, sorry."
>"I... think she's just as stumped as we are?"
>The cat nods slowly.

[PUZZLE TIME]

>"Hm.  They add up to 90.  Suppose that means anything?"
>"Uh... maybe?  I have n0 idea, An0n."
>You decide to climb back up.  From your vantage point, you see the entirety of the little nook.  There's nothing really noteworthy other than the two sets of tally marks.
>Closer inspection suggests that these marks are pretty old.  They are rather deep, though.  Probably why they're still so clear...
>You can't see too far outside due to the intense rain.  Boy, the weather got bad fast...
>You climb down, still looking outside, and accidentally let go while you're still few feet up.
>You land snugly in the arms (and considerable cleavage) of Pyr3.
>"Hey!  Be m0re careful; I d0n't want y0u getting hurt."

[HUDDLE UP]

>"I'm fine, the airbags deployed before I hit anything."
>The skull headed beast playfully punches your shoulder, much to Percy's apparent discomfort.
>"Y0u g00f.  If I hadn't been standing here when y0u started falling, y0u c0ulda been hurt."
>She hugs you close, burying your head in her chest.  As you look up at her, you see a thoughtful expression spread across her face.
>"These numbers are g0nna b0ther me."
>"We'll figure em out.  For now, let's huddle up.  It's starting to get cool in here."
>Pyr3 grins and pulls you even closer.  Percy dashes over and wraps her arms around both of you.  Though you didn't really get rained on, Percy still feels damp, as always.
>Between the two furred ladies, you're pretty warm and cozy.
>Perfect for puzzling things out.
>Hm.  Two sets of 3 numbers each... at nearly 15 feet above the ground... and the marks have been there for quite a while...

[SUMNER]

>Wait.  An idea hits you all of a sudden.
>"Hold on.  If you convert the numbers to letters, you get SUMNER."
>Percy quickly scratches out a letter to number table on her board, and lets out a triumphant sound when she sees that you're right.
>"0kay... what d0 we d0 with that kn0wledge...?"
>Huh.  Good question.
>"I dunno... sounds like a name?"
>"Hm.  Sumner.  Sumner?  S0unds like an 0ld name... which fits with the tally marks being 0ld."
>WONDER WHOSE IT IS?
>"Huh... I'm not sure."
>Pyr3 blinks out of consciousness.  Percy seems alarmed and quickly checks her pulse.
>The cat flinches when Pyr3 returns.
>"N0 luck with searching the 0l' database.  Hm.  F0und a Sumner C0unty, but that's n0where ar0und us.  That's pr0bably n0t it."
>Weird...

[CONTINUE PUZZLING]

>Hmm.  You really feel like Sumner has some meaning to it.  Surely that's not just a coincidence...?
>Then again, these numbers could represent a lot of things...
>They fit in a 24-hour span, though tally marks for time seems odd.
>Could they be observations made over time?  If that's the case, why put them so high up...?
>Why were they on two different walls?
>...wait.  There are three walls here.
>You quickly climb up the last wall...
>You find... what seems to be a very crude rendering of a deer head.  One with quite a large set of antlers.
>You count... 48 points?  Surely that's not right...
>This too seems to be a rather aged carving.
>You carefully climb down, then make your way to the north wall again.
>Cautiously, you add an additional tally to one of the numbers...
>You're caught off guard when the rock seems to... heal itself, leaving only the original marks visible.

[SHARE YOUR FINDINGS]

>Confused and a bit unnerved, you carefully make your way back down to the girls.
>"Well?  Did y0u find anything?"
>"Yeah... a carving of a deer's head.  It had huge antlers with 48 points."
>Percy quickly jots that down on her board.
>ANYTHING ELSE?
>"Yeah... I tried to add a number to the tally marks.  The rocks... healed themselves?"
>Pyr3 looks at you with disbelief.
>"Y0u're n0t seri0us, are y0u?"
>"Dead serious."
>She casually increases her height, and walks over to the wall.  She scratches a tally into the wall, and gasps when she sees that you're right.
>"W-what the?"
>STRANGE.  VERY STRANGE.
>"Yeah... no kidding."
>"This is... weird.  I d0n't think I've seen anything like this bef0re.  What ab0ut y0u, Percy?"
>NOT IN ROCKS, NO.
>I HEAL FAST, BUT I'M NOT A ROCK
>As if to demonstrate, she plunges a finger into her side, with it sinking into her spongy skin a bit.
>"...I w0nder what that deer c0uld mean?"
>"Not sure."
>LET'S THINK.
>WE HAVE "SUMNER"
>WE HAVE A DEER WITH 48 POINTS
>WE HAVE REGENERATING ROCKS
>ANY IDEAS?

[TALK TO DEER HEAD]

>You're starting to think of possible answers to this puzzle...
>But, something else is concerning you right now.  You walk over to Percy and examine her side.
>Though it's not deep, and there's no blood or anything similar, she made a fairly noticeable hole in her own side.  You figure it must've been her claws.
>"Percy, didn't that hurt?"
>A LITTLE, BUT I'LL BE ALRIGHT 
>I HEAL FAST
>A little reassured, you decide to throw some of your theories out.
>"Do you think there's another way to decide these numbers?"
>MAYBE, BUT I AGREE THAT SUMNER MUST HAVE SIGNIFICANCE 
>"48 is such an odd number compared to the rest... think there's a reason behind that?"
>NOT SURE...
>"...do you think..."
>You trail off.  Surely THAT isn't the answer...?
>GO ON...
>"...Sumner sounds like 'summoner', so... could it be that we're meant to summon whatever this is referring to?"
>PERHAPS?
>You feel a sudden drive to face the deer carving.  You stand up straight and tall, and speak to it.
>"Sumner, if that's your name... uh... give us answers?"
>There's an awkward silence, broken by a particularly loud rumble of thunder.  Pyr3 looks unimpressed, and Percy looks a bit confused.
>"Yeah, I d0n't think that did anything?"
>...did it?  You feel like you accomplished SOMETHING.
>A deep part of your mind is congratulating itself, even though nothing explicitly happened.
>...say, was the wall below that deer head always cracked?

[BREAK WALL]

>Cautiously, you take a good look at the crack in the wall.
>Nothing seems out of the ordinary... but you shine your flashlight on it just to be sure.
>...nothing catches your eye.
>Tentatively, you give the rock a little punch... and succeed in hurting your knuckles a bit.
>Determined to figure this out, you grab a nearby rock and slam it into the crack as hard as possible.
>There's a loud BANG as the crack deepens.
>Pyr3 walks over to the wall.
>"Huh?  Think s0mething's back there?  Lemme help."
>She grabs a similar rock and begins chipping away at the crack.  Percy stands by, looking nervous.
>I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THIS...
>"If it's s0mething danger0us, we're here f0r ya."
>After several minutes of chipping, you manage to deepen the crack considerably.
>But nothing interesting is visible through it.
>You and Pyr3 shrug and step back...
>Only for the wall to collapse into rubble as soon as you're out of the way.

[OBSERVE]

>While the dust clears, you make sure everyone is okay.
>You're fine, though a rock did knick your arm.  Nothing major, but you are bleeding a little.
>Pyr3 seems unharmed, but a fine layer of dust covers her fur.
>Percy was farther away from the wall than you, and so is completely unscathed.  Though, she seems to be staring at the rubble...
>You turn to follow her gaze, and see something odd.
>Atop the pile of rubble is the deer head carving.  Rather than being a mere 2D drawing, it's now revealed to be a 3-dimensional statue.
>Who made this thing?  And how did they hide it inside the wall?
>The statue is entirely made of stone, barring the horns, which seem to be... petrified branches?
>The head sits awkwardly atop the rocks.  You get the strangest feeling that it's watching you.
>A few stray bits of rock still bear the tally marks.  Another rock bears the name SUMNER in crude handwriting.
>Still other rocks seem to bear hoofprints.
>Despite having just been part of a solid stone wall, the rocks seem to bear some small plant life, somehow.
>Hmm.

[SPEAK THE NAME]

>You are compelled to speak that name aloud again.
>"...Sumner."
>There's a pause.  You repeat yourself, and nothing seems to happen.
>Pyr3 stares at the statue for a moment, and shrugs.
>"Why n0t?  Sumner."
>Percy attempts to speak the name herself, but as usual is unable to do so intelligibly.
>SUMNER.
>The three of you repeat the name over and over, walking around the statue a few times.  The wind and rain lend things a distinctly supernatural flair.
>Eventually, the three of you stop.  There's an awkward silence.
>"...this is silly.  N0thing even hap-"
>Pyr3 interrupts herself with a gasp.
>Each of the deer's 48 points suddenly sprouts a colorful bloom.  These flowers almost instantaneously wilt and die.
>The feeling of being watched intensifies.  You get the strangest notion that the deer head is pleased with your actions.

[CONVERSE?]

>...is this thing... alive?  It seems to acknowledge you speaking to it, anyway.
>You wonder if it can respond in other ways...
>"Err, Sumner, if that's your name, would you like for us to talk with you?"
>There's a pause, and one of the deer's points sprouts into a tiny tree.  It then wilts away, as the flowers did.
>...somehow you know that's a yes.
>"Okay then, uh... tell us about yourself."
>"Wait, what?  H0w d0 y0u think it's g0nna answer that?"
>You shrug.  Your gaze is suddenly drawn to a rather large, flat rock.
>It simply reads "SUMNER".
>The deer's points sprout a few blades of grass, which are suddenly cut short.  They then bend as if... being stepped on?
>Another point becomes a miniature tree trunk, and slowly collapses as if cut down.
>Once the "show" is done, the various plants wilt away.
>Hm.
>Cautiously, you step towards the head.  You offer it a small bit of food, then step back.
>You feel... appreciated.
>To your mild horror, a point suddenly sprouts a rather large flytrap-esque plant.  This plant engulfs the offered food, then wilts to nothingness.

[CONTINUE]

>You're slowly getting more comfortable with talking to this... thing.
>"Sumner, are you here against your will...?"
>Another pause.  A small fruit grows on one of the deer's points.  It falls off and promptly rots away.
>...is that a no, then?
>"Uh... okay... do you need help with anything?"
>Unlike before, there is no apparent response from the statue.  After a short wait, you write it off.
>"Okay then.  What do you want us to do?"
>A small bouquet explodes from one of the points.  Something tells you that Sumner is enjoying "speaking" with you.
>"Do you... just want me to keep asking questions and talking with you?"
>Again, a small tree grows and soon dies.  You're confident that that is a yes.

[CONTINUE]

>"I'm having a little trouble understanding you.  Can we set up a clearer yes/no system?  Maybe grow a tree and let it die for yes, and cut it down for No?"
>There's a fairly lengthy pause. You get the impression that Sumner is considering your suggestion.
>A small tree grows and rots away.  It seems that your system was accepted.
>"Great, thank you.  Can you read questions?  My friend can't speak, only write."
>Another tree decays into nothingness.
>"Try it, Percy."
>OKAY...
>WILL YOU HARM US IN ANY WAY?
>There's another pause, followed by the same miniature tree growing.  This time, however, a single cut appears across the trunk, severing the tree from its point.
>Percy seems relieved.
>"0kay, let me try.  Are y0u the 'Mind 0f the F0rest?'"
>...
>There's a long silence.  Eventually, two trees grow.  One rots away, the other is cut down.
>...you get the notion that Pyr3 may have confused Sumner.
>"Have you heard that term before?"
>Almost immediately, another tiny tree grows and finds itself cut down.
>Hm.  Seems that Sumner isn't aware of that rumor.
>...IS this what those old rumors were about all along?

[QUERY]

>Some more questions for this mysterious entity fill your mind...
>"So, would you rather us refer to you as male or female?  Or... neither?"
>There's the usual pause, and then a blue flower blooms from each point.  Presumably that means "male?"  Blue is the stereotypical "baby boy" color...
>"Okay, so to be sure: you're a 'he', right?"
>Sumner again grows a tree, and allows it to rot.
>"Okay then.  Can you show up in other places?"
>A small tree is cut down in its prime.
>"Just here, huh?  Can you affect the forest around us?"
>Though it's already windy outside, your gaze is called to one tree in particular.  It shakes incredibly violently, leaves falling and appearing to swirl around the trunk as they do so.
>...you immediately know that Sumner is responsible.
>"Oh, I see.  Thank you for the demonstration.  Do you know anything about people getting lost by following the sound of the leaves?"
>A pause.  Then, a yes, as Sumner again allows a miniature tree to decay.
>"...are you why they vanished?"
>Immediately, several tiny trees grow, only to be cut down.

[TOUCH]

>"If it's not you... is there something else making people disappear?"
>Another wilted tree sends a chill down your spine.
>"Can you protect us?"
>Another yes, this time giving you some relief.
>"Thank you.  Is there something we can do for you?  I feel like there's a reason you're here."
>There's a lengthy silence.
>You get the feeling that Sumner is thinking very hard.
>Curious, you walk over and touch Sumner's antlers.  Suddenly, you get a very vivid vision.
>It shows... the forest, having expanded to engulf everything around it.  Including the city, the lake...
>Your house.
>Suddenly, you snap back to reality.  Your fingers are wrapped in very small, thin vines.
>You carefully pull your hands away as the vines wilt away.
>...you get the sensation that your new friend(?) is looking at you expectantly.

[SHARE YOUR VISION]

>You walk back over to Pyr3 and Percy.  The cat seems rather concerned.
>ARE YOU OKAY?  YOU LOOK... FRAZZLED
>"Huh?  Y-yeah, I'm good.  Sumner... showed me something."
>"Wait, really?  What was it?  Y0u sure it wasn't y0ur imaginati0n?"
>"I'm sure.  I saw the forest growing to consume everything.  The town, my house... everything."
>Percy shakes a little.
>THE LAB?
>"Yeah, even the lab."
>Her shaking intensifies.  Pyr3 immediately pulls her into a comforting hug.
>"It's g0nna be 0kay.  We're here.  That's n0t g0nna happen."
>"...let me talk to him some more."
>You walk back up to the deer head.
>"Sumner, can you show me what's been making people vanish?"
>There's a pause.  You gently grab the antlers again, but no vision comes.
>Sumner offers a belated "no."
>"Why's that?  Do you know what it is?"
>A tree springs up and rots.
>"If you know what it is, why can't you show me?"
>Silence.  You get some sinister vibes from the air around you...
>...you decide to take a less confrontational stance.
>"Okay, sorry.  Uh... are there more like you out there?"
>A tiny tree is cut down; it lands on your foot, making you wince in pain.
>Percy dashes up to you and wraps her arms around you protectively.
>You pat her cap appreciatively, then ask another question.
>"Are you lonely, being the only one?"
>Again, Sumner presents the usual sign for no.  This time the tree mercifully misses your toes.

[QUERY]

>"So, how long have you been out here?"
>After a momentary pause, a wave of... some unknown feeling washes over you.  You feel... as though you're facing something very, very aged.
>"Oh, alright.  Were you always like this?  Were there ever any others like you?"
>Sumner responds with a yes and a no.
>"Hm.  Are we the first people to talk to you?"
>Immediately, he responds in the affirmative.
>"Oh.  Did you make the markings on the wall?"
>Another rotting tree... you can't help but wonder if that hurts him.
>"Why the puzzle?"
>...you sense that Sumner wanted to test you.
>"Hmm.  Did the missing people... die?"
>After an awkward silence, a small tree is chopped down.
>"Can they be brought back?  And what can you tell me about the hostile entity?"
>Another no... followed by a complete non-response to the second question.
>...you're beginning to feel a bit nervous around this... thing.  That vision from before...

[DISTRUST]

>Wary of your conversational partner, you glance over to see what the ladies think.
>You hadn't noticed, but Percy is still maintaining a protective grip on you.  Her arms are wrapped firmly around you, claws gently digging into your sides.
>Her mouth hangs agape slightly, fangs glinting in what little light the cave's exterior provides.  Her ears are pinned flat against her cap, and her damp fur stands on end in places.
>Pyr3 eyes up Sumner with a distrustful look.  You get the impression she's scanning him for any weaknesses should things go south.
>You can't help but notice that she has picked up a large rock, presumably just in case she needs a blunt weapon.  She glances your way, golden eyes narrowed and pupils contracted into slits.
>At least it's not just you.

[QUERY]

>Making sure you have an exit plan just in case, you decide to ask about the deer's intentions.
>"Sumner, I don't quite understand your vision from earlier.  Are you trying to... expand the forest?"
>Another pause.  You get the sensation that he's rather awkwardly thinking of what to "say".
>An extremely tiny tree grows and rots away.  You suppose that's the equivalent to a very sheepish yes.
>"...how?"
>You feel the urge to grab the antlers again, and so you do.
>Immediately, you are plunged into another lifelike hallucination.
>Shadowy, faceless individuals walk through the forest.  As they aimlessly walk, they eventually seem to fade away into nothingness, never breaking their stride.
>As they vanish, the forest steadily grows larger and more convoluted in layout, straight paths twisting into veritable Celtic knots.
>The canopy grows thicker, and the sunlight fades away...
>You snap back to reality, and break away from Sumner.
>You don't quite understand it, but you don't like the implications of that vision.

[LEAVE]

>You are growing extremely uncomfortable with this situation.
>"Well, uh... I've enjoyed talking with you, but I should really get going."
>Sumner sprouts a branch tipped with a large leaf.  This branch blows in an invisible wind, almost making it seem that the deer is waving at you.
>"Yeah, uh... nice t0 meet ya, but we're 0utta here."
>GOODBYE, SUMNER
>The three of you carefully retreat, keeping all eyes on the deer head.
>Despite the sinister aura you now pick up on, there is no apparent barrier between you and your exit.
>In fact, the three of you manage to get away from Summer with no hitches.
>You sense the mysterious entity staring at you, even from a distance.
>Soon, you find yourselves in the midst of the woods, back in the clearing you know you passed through earlier.
>You can see the path you entered the woods from, and you can even see your car.
>Phew.  You half expected the woods to... shuffle around, or something like that.

[GO HOME]

>With immense relief, you climb into your car.  Pyr3 and Percy hop in as well, and you speed off to your house.
>"That... was, uh... interesting.  Thank you both for having my back.  I don't know what I would've done without you."
>"N0 pr0blem.  I was ready t0 turn him int0 rubble if he tried anything."
>I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN YOU OUT.
>"Thanks, you two."
>The two ladies smile warmly, and gaze back at the forest as you drive away.
>"...what a creep he was, huh?  But... he didn't even try t0 st0p us."
>VERY STRANGE.  HE SEEMS FRIENDLY
>Hm.
>Eventually, you make it home.  You have the sudden urge to make a blanket fort.  You indulge this urge, and are soon joined by the girls.
>Percy purrs quietly, gently running her hands across each blanket as she handles them.
>SO SOFT!
>You gently stroke her cap, then pat Pyr3's bony head.
>Both of them smile warmly, then pull you into a comfortable group hug.

[GET COMFY]

>The three of you settle down into your freshly-constructed fort, with Pyr3 adjusting her height as necessary.
>Percy purrs loudly and snuggles up against you.  She gently rubs her head against you, her cap gently squishing and deforming slightly.
>Pyr3 yawns exaggeratedly, then throws an arm around you and the cat.  She pulls the two of you close, smiling.
>"That was pretty fun, but it's g00d t0 be h0me.  Whaddya say we just huddle up f0r a while, have s0me dinner later?"
>"Sounds good to me."
>ME TOO
>Pyr3 yawns again, and gently repositions herself, lying down.  Percy snuggles even closer to you, her purring intensifying.
>Between the smells of cinnamon and sweet spores, as well as the warmth of the ladies' fur, you feel extremely cozy and above all...
>Safe.
>That episode with Summer could've gone bad in an instant.  You're extremely grateful that Pyr3 and Percy were there for you.  And to think that you expected Percy's disguise failing to be the only possible risk...
>You glance at the clock.  Nearly dinner time, but you've got a while to just enjoy the girls' company.  You're not sleepy, but Pyr3 looks like she might doze off.

[COOK DINNER]
GAME SAVED

>Almost immediately, Pyr3 confirms your suspicions by dozing off.  She snores loudly, and Percy snickers.
>LAZYBONES
>You smile down at the sleeping beast and gently pull a blanket over her.  Then, you carefully get up and sneak into the kitchen, with your fungal friend following.
>"Want to help me with dinner?  I'm making hamburgers."
>Percy nods eagerly, her tail twitching wildly.  She scrambles over to the counter and waits patiently.
>With her watching closely, you pat out some burgers.  She eyes up your handiwork with obvious enthusiasm.
>You season up two of the burgers, and let Percy handle her own.
>Unsurprisingly, she yanks a mushroom off of her side and crumbles it over her food.  She smiles proudly, and you gently pat her cap encouragingly.
>As the burgers cook, the sweet scent of the mushroom fills your kitchen.  Percy purrs loudly as she enjoys the aroma.
>Personally, you don't particularly enjoy the combination of sweet and meaty scents.

[SAUTEE MUSHROOMS]

>You can't help but smile at Percy's happiness.
>"So, how was your first day out?"
>I LOVED IT
>HAD A LOT OF FUN 
>EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T LIKE SUMNER
>"Yeah, uh... he kinda creeped me out too, a little.  Glad you enjoyed yourself though."
>THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME WITH YOU
>She suddenly wraps her arms around you, hugging you tightly.  You return the gesture.
>When she releases you, you make your way to the fridge.  You just remembered buying some mushrooms the other day.
>You quickly saute them up, much to Percy's obvious excitement, and top her burger off with them.
>"Y'know, there are a lot of types of mushrooms out there.  Next time I go shopping, I'll pick you up some to try."
>THANK YOU, I'D LIKE THAT
>"Thought you might, heh."
>You pat her cap, with her enthusiastically leaning into your pats.

[SERVE DINNER]
GAME SAVED

>Eventually, dinner is ready to serve.
>"Percy, can you go wake Pyr3 up before her food gets cold?"
>Without so much as writing a word, the cat dashes off into the living room.
>Before long, she returns, following a drowsy Pyr3.
>"Mm?  W-where's the fire?  Did y0u need s0methin'?"
>You chuckle.
>"No, dinner's done and I didn't want your burger getting cold."
>At the mention of dinner, the skull headed beast immediately perks up.
>"00h!  Why didn't ya say s0?  Let's dig in."
>She quickly makes her way to the table, with Percy following behind.
>Once they're seated, you serve up everyone's food, making sure to give Percy her personalized burger.
>True to form, Pyr3 scarfs down her dinner in minutes.  You pace yourself, but still finish before your fungal friend.
>She seems to savor every last bite, smiling proudly.  When she finally finishes, she excitedly scribbles another message.
>I HELPED MAKE THAT!
>Pyr3 smiles warmly.
>"Really?  That's great."
>Percy beams at her crimson-furred friend.

[SHOWER]

>Once dinner is finished, you begin to realize how... dirty you feel.  You HAVE spent all day in the woods, dealing with some kinda... sinister force.
>It's probably about time for a shower.
>"Hey, I'm gonna go get cleaned up real quick.  I'll be back."
>Percy waves as you head off to the bathroom...
>But Pyr3 follows you.
>"Heh.  I'm with y0u: I need a sh0wer."
>Once you're out of Percy's line of sight, Pyr3 winks at you, a wicked smile appearing.
>"H0w b0ut we share a sh0wer, save s0me water, eh~?"
>You don't even attempt to protest.  Once you reach the bathroom, the red-furred woman steps under the shower and turns it on.
>The water cascades off of her beautifully, tracing her curves tantalizingly.  She meets your eyes and winks again.
>You quickly undress and join her beneath the hot downpour.
>As soon as you do so, she presses herself against you.  Her hot, wet fur caresses your bare skin wonderfully.  Her bountiful chest is squeezed between the two of you.
>Without a word, she pulls you into a passionate kiss.  You quickly reciprocate, wrapping an arm around her middle...
>And grabbing a handful of ass with the other arm.
>She once again winks lasciviously, and pulls you even closer.
>You soon feel a clawed hand slipping down towards your member...

>...once your very lengthy shower finally ends, you stagger out of the bathroom, fully dressed and satisfied.  Percy is sitting on the couch, reading.  She waves vaguely without looking up.
>Pyr3 whispers.
>"it's a g00d thing she's such a b00kw0rm, heh."

[RUN A BUBBLE BATH]

>You gently tap Percy on the shoulder, recoiling a bit when your hand meets one of her many mushrooms.
>She stops reading and looks over her shoulder at you.
>"Do you want to get cleaned up too?  I'll run you a bath."
>She nods appreciatively, so you head back to the bathroom.  Once there, you run a bubble bath.
>Not just a bubble bath: the sudsiest, bubbliest bath you've ever ran in your life.
>Only the best for your friend.
>Once it's all set, you go to grab her. She sets the e-reader down, and follows you, smiling warmly.
>Once you show off the bath, she laughs slowly, yet raucously.
>THAT'S A LOT OF BUBBLES
>"Yep; all for you."
>Suddenly, she dashes past you and leaps into the tub, sending soapy water everywhere.
>She resurfaces from the carpet of bubbles, cackling in her strange way.  She grins at you, then sinks into the water a bit, clearly relaxed.
>You gently rub her ears, and she purrs softly.  She soon lays back in the tub, basking in the warm, bubbly water.
>A smile slowly spreads across her face, and she reaches a hand out to gently pat you on the shoulder.

[CONTROL SHIFTING TO PERCY]

>Percy had never imagined that a tub could hold so many bubbles.
>It seemed that the suds towered over her head as she laid back. It gave her the impression of being in some grand canyon, nestled between soft, fragile mountains.
>She couldn't help but chuckle at the whimsical sight, though she was trying to regain her composure. A difficult task, given that she'd not experienced anything like this before.
>When they were in the lab, the scientists never did anything of this sort. If they felt she needed cleaning, they merely hosed her down from what they called a "safe distance."
>A small sigh escaped her throat as she dwelled on those days...
>Thankfully, the voice of Anon brought her out of her thoughts.
>"You want some help scrubbing?"
>She thought about it, and shook her head. She appreciated the offer, but wanted to just enjoy a nice soak.
>She sank further into the water, watching the various mushrooms coating her body gradually dip below the surface.
>Eventually there was little above water but her head and chest. She purred happily, enjoying the warmth and comfort of the bath water.
