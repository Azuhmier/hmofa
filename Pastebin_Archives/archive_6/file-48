Chapter 1: 3030
>The year is 3030
>You are Anon, living on terra's ringworld around Alpha Centauri
>You were a pretty Basic human
>No serious augmentations just a few "enhancements" your former employer had given you
>While you were an ordinary guy the thing that most stood out was your sheer height
>You stood at over 2 meters tall and that earned you attention
>Attention from the local crime boss that is
>He hired you on for your size, provided Stamina and Muscle augmentations to make you both intimidating and able to fight
>A small side effect of them being small steam vents on your shoulders and thighs, easily covered though so not a huge deal
>Most of your jobs from him were either go with someone to a deal and look menacing 
>Somewhere a bit more physical
>You didn't enjoy those jobs much, because most of the time they were just normal folks who were having a tough time
>The ringworlds government was pretty far up its own ass and therefore didn't care about people
>Either way, your employment had come to an end when a deal had gone south 
>It was supposed to be a simple delivery but someone had to try to strong arm the deal
>You had to fight 
>And you did, but someone alerted the feds
>The cops arrived and you were arrested and charged with violence
>They couldn't get anything else on you 
>There was no court system, nothing to say you were innocent
>You were thrown in jail for the better part of 2 years
>You were released on parole recently, overcrowding in the prison system meant that you were able to get out
>However they warned you that if you worked for the boss again you would be put away for a long long time
>The boss had come to see you when you were released
>He shook your hand and thanked you for not snitching him out like the other guy you got arrested with
>He said he would pull some strings for you to get you a good job using the augs he gave you until you were off parole
>Either way you were currently sitting in a parole office to meet your new parole officer
>You weren't waiting too long before an Anthro Wolf walks in
>Anthros were a common thing on the ring 
>This Universe had a mirror one that was purely humans, and occasionally humans from that universe got pulled into this one
>Scientists had figured out how it happened but didn’t know why still
>Something about Psionic frequencies or something
>This was hundreds of years ago 
>Anthros were very prevalent now
>This wolf girl had shoulder length pink hair and bright pink eyes
>What is this one of those weeby shows your friend watched?
>"What’s up Sakura" you say pulling the first anime name you could think of
>She looks at you confused then a look of realization covered her face
>"Ohh the hair right? Very clever" she says sarcastically
>You study her trying to get a feel for her
>She’s about 5'9, has at least E cups, her fur is black
>She's wearing jeans and a basic sweater
>Not what you expected
>She sits down at her desk and looks at some papers
>"You're Anon right" she says finally
>"Yea that's me" you answer
>"You were convicted of disturbing the peace due to violence? You were in a fight?"
>She looks down at the papers again
>"And you have ties to criminal organizations"
>"Yep"
> She sighs
>"You're not going to cause me any issues are you? I don't need that you know" she says exhaustedly
>"Well I don't even know your name yet so I can't say" you retort 
>She facepalms
>"Fuck you're right, sorry I haven't gotten much sleep, I'm still getting used to the day cycles of the ring and the gravity" she explains
>"My name is Isabelle"
>She extends her paw to you
>You shake it
>"Ooo firm handshake" she says
>"You said you're still getting used to the day cycle here? What are you from Terra?" you ask
>"I'm from the Reef station in the Sol system, I just transferred here a few days ago" she explains as she shuffles through the papers in front of her
>The reef station was a space station in Sols asteroid belt, it collected the metals from the asteroids
>It was a wealthy place to live due to having a huge monopoly on most rare metals
>"let’s get down to business so you can go about your day and I can try to find some food around here" she says
>She explains the parole conditions
>Every week she would come by your place or you would come to her to for a check in basically
>She would make sure you weren't on drugs or back working for the boss
>You could also be searched at any time
>Pretty basic stuff
>With all that out of the way she puts all the papers in a folder with "Anon" on the tab
>"Well that's that Anon, I'll see you next week" she says as she stands up to put the folder in her file cabinet
>"You said you wanted food? I know some places around here I could show you if you like" you say as you stand up
>She looks up at you
>"Fuck you’re tall"
>"Yep"
>"I mean WOW! You’re tall! Your file said you were tall but seeing it up close it different!" Her pink eyes look you up and down 
>"Look do you want to get a bite or no?" you ask
>You're used to this but it gets tiring after a while
>"Oh uhh, is it ok? Shouldn’t we stay professional or something like that?" she asks as she walks over to you and compares her own height to yours
>"Isn't getting to know your parolee part of the job? I mean you're going to be come to my apartment at points" 
>She puts a pad to her chin and looks up
>"Hm I guess you're right there Anon" she says finally
>You leave her office and she follows
>"Are we walking? I don't have a FloCar yet"
>The FloCar was a self-driving flying/hover car, some people were augmented to be able to interface with them directly and "feel" what the car was feeling and see what the car was seeing
>They said it was to feel wind and gave freedom
>"Nah I have a Hoverbike" you say as you walk over to where it’s parked
>Your Hoverbike was a custom build, longer seats and a bigger engine, it was Black and green
>Luckily your friend, an Anthro Leopard who was heavily augmented, had looked after it while you were in jail
>You toss her a clip and hook one to your ear
>"What do I do with this" she says looking at it
>"What? You never rode a Hoverbike or had a Helmet?"
>Her ears go flat on her head
>"Uhh we always had FloCars on the reef, father said that Hoverbikes were too dangerous"
>Jesus sheltered much
>"Well unless you don't want a ride to the Pizza place, Hoverbike is the way" you say
>Her eyes light up "Pizza? Who said I wanted Pizza?"
>"Everyone likes pizza, besides I know the owner, best pizza this side of the ring" you say taking the clip from her
>"Here" you hook the clip to her ear and press a button on it
>It flashes a red light then a black Plas-steel Helmet forms around her head 
>It even has little parts sticking up for her ears
>"Wha?” She starts
>"It scans your noggin and makes the best fit helmet for you" you explain as you press the button on your clip
> Your helmet is customized as well 
>Black with a green silhouette of a feral lion on the side and the word "Titan" Underneath that
>"Wmmhm domm tomomo memm" you can barely hear Isabelle
>You reach over and press a button on her helmet and the same on yours
>"Can you hear me" you ask
>"Whoa what? How can I hear you so well?"
>You almost feel bad for the poor Wolf
>"Built in microphones and speakers, lets me hear you and you hear me" you explain 
>"Oh that makes sense now that you say it, what does Titan mean?"
>You straddle your Bike and place an open palm on the side of it
>It roars to life
>"It’s a nickname I got because of my size" you explain
>"Oh who gave it to you?" 
>"The boss"
>"Oh right...Organized crime...” she says nervously
>She quickly changes the subject
>"Wow I thought Internal combustion engines were banned" Isabelle says looking at you and the Bike
>"Plasma coil induction engine" you say patting the bikes side "Keeps her running good and fast"
>Isabelle walks over slowly and cautiously gets on the bike behind you
>"Hold on to me tight" you say looking at traffic zooming by
>She barely puts her hands on your waist
>"I said tight" you say with a small laugh
>Her grip barely changes
>Oh well, she'll learn
>You spot an opening in the traffic and Punch it
>In an instant the bike is up and roaring forward
>Traffic speeds on the ring were high as they were everywhere
>Most FloCars were constantly talking to each other and driving themselves
>As a result anything above street level traffic was at 70-150 MPH
>"OH MY FUCK!" Isabelle yells as the bike zips into traffic
>She now has her arms totally wrapped around you in a death grip
>Heh wolf titties on your back
>"Do we have to go so fast!?!" she yells
>"OW! You don't have to yell! It’s a microphone! And yes unless you want to be splattered on one of those fancy cars!"
>"Oh yea I don't want that"
>You're riding away from the Capital city of the ring, Ascension.
>They called it that when the ring was built a few hundred years ago
>Something about TerraKinds ascension into the stars
>Can’t say Mankind anymore
>To you it was just another corrupt government pandering to the rich
>"Look at the city! I've only seen it when I landed!" Isabelle says
>You sneak a quick peek
>The city has its near constant Fog around it, it looks like a Mix of those 21st century Movies Tron and what was the other? Blade runner, that’s it
>Neon Advertisements, Airships with large billboard telling everyone that their dick was too small and it could be augmented
>The lights reflected off the fog (the fog had something to do with the environmental control and so many people)
>You focus on driving and pull off the main road onto a side street after about 5 miles of veering through FloCars
>You're on the street of an Urban Neighborhood, FloCars Zoomed by overhead making the whole area have a constant low buzz sound
>You stop the bike in front of a small pizza shack
>The words "Tony's Pizza shack" it flashing bright letter above the door
>"I didn't expect a place like this" Isabelle says, sounding a bit disgusted
>You look at her as she looks around the area
>"What did you expect? Most of the Ring Neighborhoods are like this" you say as you click the button on your Clip
>Your helmet Dematerializes
>You see her fumbling around trying to do the same
>You take pity on her and click it off
>"Oh uhh yea thanks" she says looking distressed that she needed help with something simple
>"Don't mention it, come on I'll introduce you to Tony"
>You walk inside, and hold the door open for Isabelle
>A small "ding" goes off somewhere in the back before an Italian Greyhound Anthro with long black hair comes to the window
>"AYEEEEEE TITAAANNNN!" the greyhound yells with a huge smile
>"Hey Tony, how ya been?" you say as he quickly zooms out of the kitchen and up to you
>You do a complicated handshake and finally hug the Greyhound who is only about 5'5
>"Good man! Where ya been?" he asks beaming up at you
>"Jail"
>He tuts
>"I told you that you were gonna get in trouble if you kept running with that crowd!" 
>He peeks behind you
>"Just outta jail and already got a date? Dam man you move fast" he says nudging your side
>"I'm Isabelle, I'm actually his parole officer" Isabelle introduces herself stepping forward to shake paws
>Tony slicks his long hair back
>"Oh Nice to meet you then" Instead of shaking paws he takes her paw and kisses it
>You look at him 
>"Creepy man"
>"It's called flattery! You should try it sometime!" he says before turning and going back to the kitchen
>"So what can I get for you Titan?"
>"Ah the usual, I've been dying for some of your pepperoni pizza man!" you answer
>You look at Isabelle
>"That's fine with you right?” you ask worriedly
>Could she be one of those Preds trying to go vegetarian?
>It was the newest fad 
>"No no pepperoni is my favorite!" she says 
>"Cool man! Drinks are in the fridge!"
>Tony points to a large glass display fridge with various drinks
>Open it and grab a Dr.Pepper™
>"What would you like Isabelle?" you ask poking you head over the door to look at her directly
>"Uhh water will do"
>You grab a water and take a seat
>You pop open the Dr.Pepper™ and take a nice cold refreshing drink
>"Ah fuck I've missed those" you say
>Isabelle sits down across from you
>"How do you know about this place?" 
>"I grew up here, I know everyone in this neighborhood"
>She’s looking out the window
>"But I only see Anthros here. Is this a Beasttown?"
>Beasttown was the name of Areas around Cities 
>Areas that were mainly Anthro, 
>It wasn't exactly a positive name either
>"Yes it technically is a Beasttown, but don't let people hear you calling it that" you say as you pull out a cigarette and light up
>You offer one to her which she politely declines
>"Why did you grow up in a Beas-...In this area of the city? Aren’t there uhh...programs to help people out of this kind of situation?"
>"You mean the Slums? There are programs but they haven't done anything for years because of bureaucracy" you say before taking a drag of your smoke
>"And why did you grow up here?"
>"No choice"
>"What does tha-?" she’s interrupted by tony bringing by a large pepperoni pizza
>"Careful it’s still hot, Titan don't eat it all yourself" Tony warns you with a pizza cutter
>Isabelle laughs 
>"This is like an 18 inch pizza! He couldn't eat it by himself" she says still laughing
>Tony Laughs this time
>"I have seen him eat 3 in one sitting" he says to Isabelle
>"Hey I was drunk, that's not fair" you defend yourself but the damage is done
>Isabelle is looking at you half disgusted and half impressed
>"Wow" is all she says
>"Whatever! Let’s just eat" you say taking a slice
>You bite down and instantly regret not waiting because you burn your tongue
>Fuck me
>You swallow your bite and put the pizza down
>Isabelle is stifling a laugh
>"So what made you leave the reef and come to the ring, namely Ascension?" you ask
>She pulls a slice of pizza onto a plate
>"I wanted to help people, but knew I couldn't be a police officer, so I decided to help people get their lives back on track" She says quietly
>"So I went to college and applied here because the ring is notorious for crime"
>"And you got stuck with me for your first parolee? Geez that's tough" you say with a laugh
>"It’s not funny" she snaps angrily 
>"People need help and I'm doing what I think I can! You have no idea how long it took me to convince father I wasn't wasting my life!" she continues in the same angry tone
>"Sorry just... my father wanted me to study robotics like him, he designs mining robots for the reefs companies" she explains
>You take a bite out of your pizza and find it has cooled enough to eat
>"By the way Anon, what Augs do you have? Your file said you have augmentations but didn't explain what they were" she asks before biting into her pizza 
>"Ooo das good" she cooes to her pizza slice
>"Told ya" you say "And I left that part out because I didn't want it on my records"
>"Then tell me off records, I'm curious. Did you get one of those leg extender mods to make you taller?"
>You laugh
>"Leg extender mods! All those beta Manlets who felt bad about their height got one and learned it ONLY extends the legs, not the arms and torso! They were walking around like fuckin' T-Rexs with those tiny ass arms and long legs" you laugh out
>Isabelle laughs too
>"Oh I remember seeing that on the Extranet! Some of them couldn't walk right because their ankles couldn't deal with the extra walking strain!" she laughs
>"Yea, no I don't have leg extensions, but off the record, I Have a Nano muscular and skeletal weave, and Stamina enhancers"
>You roll up a sleeve and show her the small metal vents in your shoulder
>The Nano muscular and skeletal weave was Nano wires of some super strong Material you forgot the name of, laced through your Muscle and skeletal structure
>Something about extra help with muscle contraction and bone density to compensate the extra strength
>Stamina is just what it sounds like.
>She gasps in surprise "isn't that expensive?"
>You nod
>"And painful to have put in, but things are a lot cheaper if the guy who runs the black market on them owes you a few favors."
>"Jesus, black markets, fights, mods usually reserved for Athletes, how long were you with the Mafia" she asks with a surprised look
>Her ears are perked forward
>You scratch your chin
>"Still off the records?" you ask
>She now looks slightly unsure
>"Uhh sure" 
>"About 14 years" 
>Her eyes go wide
>"Then you would have been a kid! How did that happen?!"
>"You get a lot of attention when you're the only human in an Anthro school"
>"What do you mean?" she presses for more information
>"I got picked on a lot in school, so much I fought back, and kept fighting" you answer
>"Eventually I got recruited to help with low level stuff and the rest is history"
>"What did your parents think? What do they think about you working in an Anthro Mafia?"
>"It’s not a mafia it’s just a group of people working for better lives for everyone through some less than legal means"
>"You keep dodging questions, don't think I haven't noticed! I went to school for this kind of stuff"
>"I don't have to answer all the questions you ask though, those are subjects I don't want to talk about" you reply
>Her ears droop slightly
>"S-sorry, I should have known not to ask some things, can I ask what you mean about working for better lives for everyone?" she asks still with a slight droop in her ears 
>"Uh sure off the records" you say
>"Of course!" her ears perk back up and you hear her tail swishing side to side
>"Well here's an example, when I got picked up the deal we were trying to push through was for Heat suppressors and Juvenile calmers"
>Heat suppressors where for Female Anthros to help keep their heat cycles manageable
>The Juvenile calmers were for when certain species of Anthros go through Puberty they become aggressive towards their respective gender, although mainly in males, some females like Hyenas had it happen.
>"Those are easy to get though!" Isabelle states angrily "That's not good for anyone"
>"They are easy to get if you can pay as much as they ask for them or if you have insurance" you retort
>"What? What do you mean?" she asks clearly confused
>"God were you that sheltered?" you ask
>Her ears go flat
>"O-don't you just go to the doctor and ask for them?" she stammers not looking you in the eyes
>"Uhh... No it doesn't unless you have insurance, which most people around here cannot afford" you explain
>"And they can’t pay full price for it because the companies bumped up prices"
>She’s quiet for a second 
>"I didn't know that..."she says finally
>You feel bad now
>"Look let’s just finish our food then if you want I can take you home or back to your office" you offer
>She lights up again
>"Home! I could use your help Muscle man" she says with an excited jump
>She eats 3 slices of pizza and you finish the rest
>"God he wasn't joking about you eating a whole pizza..."
>Tony pops his head through the window
>"TOLD YA!"
>You walk over to Tony and reach for your Holophone
>The Holophone was an all in one device
>Wallet, Video messages, texts, holo calls, regular calls, you name it
>"How much do I owe ya Tony?" 
>He puts up a paw to stop you
>"On the house Titan, consider it a welcome back gift" he says
>You give him a man hug
>"Thanks buddy, see ya around" you say
>You head out and Isabelle follows you 
>You hand her the clip and she pushes the button
>You put yours on and they sync up automatically this time
>You get on the Hoverbike and Isabelle follows suit and this time holds on to you tight
>More wolf titties on your back
>You start it up and get going
>"Where am I taking you?" you ask her
>She gives you the address and a small HUD comes over your helmet screen showing the way
>You follow the route while listening to Isabelle oo and ahh at the scenes that fly by
>You arrive at a very ritzy looking townhouse in one of the more...expensive areas on the ring
>"This is my place! Come on I need your help moving my Biodispenser! It’s too heavy for me" she says bounding up the stone stairs
> A Biodispenser uses amino acids to make the majority of perishable foods all you have to do is program them in
>The more expensive the more programmable foods
>You walk up slowly and into the foyer
>It’s bigger than your whole apartment
>"Sorry about all the boxes! Come here and tell me if you can get this" she calls from the other room
>You follow her voice and you find her near the back door with a large box on the Small balcony
>You walk over to it and test the weight
>Hm about 300 lbs.
>You pick it up and throw it on your shoulder 
>"Jesus those mods are something" she says before scampering into the house before you
>"Over here to the kitchen" 
>You carry the Biodispenser to the kitchen
>"Where do ya want it?" you ask 
>She indicated a spot for it to hook up "here please"
>You set it down 
>"Do you need help setting it up" 
>>"N-no..." she stammers
>You give her a scrutinizing look 
>"Yes..." she says looking down at her foot paws
>You unbox it and pull it out
>You then hook it all up and check to make sure it works
>You make a banana
>"You gotta taste test the things at first" you explain as you bite into the banana
>Hm tastes about right
>"Well then I'll see you around Isabelle" you say as you head out
>"Wait" she calls
>She hands you a datachip 
>"That's all my contact info, call me if you need anything"
>"Anything?" you say as you raise an eyebrow at her
>"Anything professional" she says with a smile
>You clip on your helmet and get on your bike and head home


Chapter 2: Feeling good
>It’s a short ride but it’s still dark when you arrive
>You're unsure how the day night cycles work on a giant ring floating through space work but whatever
>You pull into your assigned parking spot and enter the building 
>It’s been a while but this apartment is more of a condo
>You own the actual apartment you live in
>You place your palm on the door and the door slides open with a soft 'voosh'
>You walk into your apartment and it’s just like you left it 
>It’s only a 1 bedroom apartment
>The bedroom is detached but the kitchen and living room are only 1 room
>At least the bathroom was separate too
>The whole place is pretty Spartan
>A computer, a small table with a chair, a single recliner in front of the computer
>The bedroom isn't much better, a bed, a nightstand a lamp
>"Darken windows"
>The windows go opaque black in response
>You sit down at your computer
>There is a holo message waiting
>You click it and the bosses image floats up
>He's in his late 50's and is a Cougar Anthro
>"Titan, I got you a job where you can use those muscles of yours son, you're gonna work at the UltraLux as a bouncer or bodyguard" the hologram speaks
>"I spoke to the boss there, nice guy, his contact info is attached to this Message"
>The hologram winks
>"If ya ever wanna come back to the business let me know, I'll see ya around Titan"
>The UltraLux is a ritzy extremely high end Casino and strip club for high rollers
>It also had Prostitution, Pornstars of every species and gender looking to make extra money
>That was underground of course, you knew this due to connections
>If the boss got you a job there he had to have pulled more than a few strings
>You pull up the contact info and click it
>A few moments later a Holographic image of Mink Anthro in a suit comes up
>"Hello this is Steven, UltraLux security Manager how can I help you, sir" it says
>"Uh...Hi...my name is Anon, the bo- Ahem, Gabriel Flinn said he had gotten me a job at the Ultralux and I should contact you sir" you say unsure of what to say
>"Ah yes he said you would be calling, although he referred to you as Titan" he pauses "I can see why" he adds finally
>"Alright then you need to be measured for your suit as well as you need to get the proper certificates" he says as a few blips come up. 
>"You can get them via these links, after you get those call me back and please don't wait, I feel it’s better for both of us if Mr.Flinn is kept happy"
>You nod in agreement
>"Alright I'll get to it then" you say
>"I look forward to working with you...Should I call you Anon or Titan?" he asks
>"Either is fine"
>"Very well Titan" he says before the hologram disappears

>You click the links that Steven sent you
>Most were ones you could to put into a datachip and install 
>The way people learned new skills and things were not only by experience now
>You could upload them directly to your brain now
>The idea was from "the matrix" an old 21st century movie
>The first prototypes were... gruesome and required a data port be installed into your skull
>They had come a long way, now you just needed a bed with a Braindome installed
>You hated using the thing because it gave you headaches the whole next day
>But this was for a job, so you were gonna have to get friendly with some Ibuprofen 
>You were also going to need a firearm permit
>You weren't a felon so you could own a Gun still
>But it looks like Isabelle was going to need to sign off on it 
>You think about calling her so you check the clock
>8 PM
>Hmm a call wouldn't hurt right?
>Unless she was one of those weirdos what went to sleep at 8
>You Slide the datachip into the computer 
>Several different options come up
>Work
>Emergency
>Home
>You tap the home option, you're only waiting about a second before her image pops up
>She’s wearing a Onesie that's bright pink like her hair
>You can see she isn't wearing a bra since you can see her nipples poking through the fabric
>God those tits are huge.....
>You shake the thought away
>"Hey Isabelle" you greet her warmly
>"Oh hi Anon, what’s up? I didn't expect a call from you so soon" she says with her ears flicking slightly
>"I have a form I need you to sign off for my new job" you explain
>"A form? What for? And dam, you're fast getting a job, I would be impressed but you seem to know everyone"
>"It’s for a firearm permit"
>She pauses 
>"A firearm, really? I'm not stupid you know!" she says looking very displeased
>"I swear it for the job! I'll even come by and show you everything tomorrow! I just thought I would let you know" you say putting your hands up in Mock defense
>She thinks for a second, her paw scratching her chin
>"Alright I want to see proof and all that jazz" she says after a moment
>"Thank you" you say, relieved she'll even listen
>"Oh, where did you get a job by the way?" she asks her ears perked up 
>"the UltraLux as a bouncer slash bodyguard for high rollers" you answer
>Her eyes go wide 
>"THE UltraLux? Like the system famous UltraLux? The Ritzy Hotel Casino thing?!" She asks her eyes still wide and her tail swishing
>"I didn't know there was another UltraLux so yea THE UltraLux." you say sarcastically
>"Shush Mister wise guy" she says crossing her arms
>"Anyway I'll be in tomorrow at 9 ish is that cool with you?" you ask
>"Yea that's fine" she says with a smile
>"Ok goodnight Isabelle" you say smiling at her "Nice onesie by the way"
>Her ears droop and she looks down at her pajamas
>"Fuck I forgot I was wearing this, I look like an Idiot don't I?" she says looking down at herself
>"Nah, you actually look really cute" 
>Her ears perk up and her tail swishes slightly
>"Really? You think so? Thank you!" she jumps slightly
>Boob jiggles herrr
>"Anyway goodnight" you say again
>"Goodnight Anon"
>Her hologram disappears
>You stay awake catching upon current events for a while
>2 years in prison you miss some things
>At about 11 you take a smoke break and head to bed
>You put the Datachips into the Braindome and go to sleep

Chapter 3: Nevermind
>You wake up and groan
>It’s like a hangover headache that water and Gatorade™ can’t fix
>"Time" you groan
>"The time is 7:30 AM" a little voice says
>You gotta love the Future
You get up and head into your bathroom
>You drain the snake and down 8 ibuprofens
>You get dressing in your usual get up
>Tank top with (Insert Band here) Jeans and your riding Jacket
>You get all the info for Isabelle on a Datachip
>You head out and downstairs to your Hoverbike
>You start her up and get going
>The traffic is pretty bad in the mornings regardless of all the FloCars fancy innovations it still slows down 
>You're able to lane split some of it but still you arrive at Isabelle Office at 8:45
>Walking in you already can see things have changed
>She has put pictures up of her family, added some little Knick knacks 
>She is wearing a Button up blouse and jeans
>You can see the buttons straining around her impressive bust
>"Oh Anon! You’re just what I need right now!" she says excited
>What
>"Can you get put this up for me? I'm not tall enough to get it up" she says as she hands you a "Hang in there" poster with a cat hanging onto a rope
>"Uh yea, where do you want it" you ask
>She turns from you and you get a chance to look at the rest of her
>Her long tail is black like the rest of her except a bit of white at the end
>She has a pretty impressive ass as well
>"Up there!" says pointing to a corner
>You walk over and press it to the wall
>It holds fast
>No need for tacks in the future
>You don't know how it works but it does so whatever stop asking questions
>"Now then let see this Firearm stuff you told me about"
>You hand her the Datachip and sit down at her desk
>She puts it into her computer and begins reading through it all
>"Dang Anon you weren't lying, not only are you gonna have a kinetic pistol but you'll have access to plasma shotguns and even those new regenerating grenade launchers" she says with her eyes wide
>"Yea, they want me to be able to handle anything" you say with a shrug
>"Hey, how much does it pay by the way?" she asks
>"Uhmm"
>You pull out your Holophone and thumb through the info
>"Ah uhh....8k credits per month not including the Personal bodyguard pay" you say
>Her eyes look like dinner plates
>Weird pink dinner plates
>"Wow that's a lot Anon! You're like the best parolee I could ask for!" she says wagging her tail 
>"I would think not being on parole would be best" you say with a smirk
>"Yea well, we'll see how you're doing in 6 months first THEN we can see if you're off parole"
>Fair enough
>"Hey Anon when can I come by your place? I need to get access to it as well as do my weekly check in"
>You think
>You didn't have any real plans besides getting things going for work, in fact after getting your suit for work you didn't have any plans
>"Uhh anything I guess, just give me a call beforehand ok?" you answer
>She flashes you a toothy smile
>"Great!"
>"Let me sign off on all these and let you get going" Isabelle says as she taps on the documents on the holoscreen
>She then ejects the datachip and hands it to you
>"Thanks Isabelle" you say with a smile
>Her ears perk up and her tail wags as you say that
>"I-it’s no problem Anon. Do you mind giving me a lift to this FloCar dealership? I need to get a one and Father says he'll get it for me"
>Why does she always say father? Whatever
>"Yea sure, least I can do after you signed all that stuff for me" you say as you go to leave
>Isabelle shuts of her computer and hurries after you
>"Goddam you and your freakishly long legs, walk at a normal speed!" she jokingly says
>"This is normal speed Tiny, grab some roller skates and hold onto my belt I don't have all day" you quip back
>"Hey I'm not short! You’re just freakishly tall! Most wolves are about my height!" she retorts 
>"Sure thing Munchkin"
>You get to your bike and start it up then hand Isabelle a clip
>She puts it on and pushes the button making the helmet materialize
>You follow suit and your HUD shows you directions to the dealership
>She wraps her arms around you tightly
>God her tits keep getting better every time you feel them press you on
>NO! Bad Penis! You stay down!
>You focus on the road and not on the godly tits pressed on you
>"Don't you have other Parolees to meet today?" You say as you pull away from the curb
>"No not until next week, right now you're the only one I have and you're much easier to deal with than I thought!" she says with an excited tone
>You can’t see her face obviously
>"What do you mean?" you ask as you Zip through traffic
>"Well when I read your record, it was really scared of you!" she says 
>"Scared?"
>"Well I mean you read about a human that's over 2 meters tall, has ties to the local organized crime, and was busted for fighting, you sound like a scary guy" she says defending her position
>"I am a scary guy" you say calmly "I've done a lot of bad things"
>"But here you are driving your parole officer to get a new car, you're a good guy Anon, I think you just had the cards dealt against you, but I think that about everyone, that's why I became a parole officer" 
>You remain silent as you ride
>The things you've done to people couldn't be covered up by this new life
>"Do you know what I did to the guy that I was fighting when I was arrested? Was it in my file?" you ask quietly
>"Uhh no I don’t think so. Why? What did you do?" Isabelle asks with a surprised tone
>"I broke his back when he attacked my friend. Chances are he won’t walk again" you answer 
>"Wha? Can’t they just repair the damage? I've seen lots of people get that procedure done" 
>"They can't afford that kind of medical treatment, I mean if people can't even afford heat suppressors how can they afford that?
>"Oh uhh.....Right"
>You feel her take an arm from around you and her place a hand on your back
>"I don't know everything you've done Anon, but I know you've done nothing but help me since we met"
>"Anyway, we're here" you say
>You look at the place
>This is a top of the line dealership, like best of the best
>"You sure this is the right place?" you ask shutting down your bike and dematerializing your helmet
>"This is the place father told me to go" she says as she pull up her Holophone and looks through the messages
>"Yea, this is it" she says after double checking "why what’s wrong?"
>"These are.... Expensive" you say looking at a few of them
>You don't even want to touch them they are so expensive
>The nearest salesman walks up to you, another human
>"Hello sir, are you uhh..... Are you lost? You don't look like our usual clientele" the salesman says
>You scowl
>He backs up a bit 
>Isabelle saves him 
>"He gave me a ride here, what do you mean usual?"
>The salesman looks from you to her and back
>"Your friend is a little...." he searches for words
>"Rough around the edges... We usually serve more refined Clients, like yourself"
>Your frown deepens
>"Ah I see" Isabelle says
>She turns to you
>"Anon let’s go...Don't want you to scare off their "refined" clients" she says
>The salesmen looks like he’s about to say something
>"Save it" you growl as you start you bike and Rev it at him
>Isabelle jumps on the back of the bike and you peel off 
>You ride in silence for a while
>"I'm....I'm sorry Anon" Isabelle finally says snapping you out of your anger
>"S'not your fault Isabelle, I'm used to it anyway" you say as you weave through the various FloCars
>"You mean that's normal?!" She says with a shocked tone
>"It’s not like I'm a...."refined person" like I said before I'm a scary guy, people don't expect much from me besides being scary" you say as you Pull into another dealership near Beasttown
>"Anyway we're here" you say as you park and dismount
>You help Isabelle off the bike 
>"Where are we?" 
>"A FloCar Dealership duh" 
>She huffs as she takes off her helmet clip "I know that"
>"My friend owns the place, he'll take care of you" you answer 
>You walk with her into the building and a salesman, a young Anthro armadillo walks up
>"Good morning sir, good morning Ma'am, how can I...Oh hi Titan, want me to go get Patches?" He says
>"Yea that would be great Ricky, you've grown since I last saw you" you say with a smile
>"Just Rick now, Titan, I'm trying to sound more grown up. Also I see you're as big as ever!" 
>He extends a Paw and you shake it
>"I'll be right back Man!" he says before zooming off
>Isabelle is looking at you
>"What? He’s a good kid and I used to work here part time with Patches" you say
>"You know everybody around here. How?" she asks
>"When you're the only Human this side of town it happens" you answer as you look through the window of the Nearest FloCar
>"2 Ton Titan! MY MAN!" you hear a booming voice with a Russian accent behind you
>You turn around and an Anthro bear is lumbering towards you
>"Aye Its Unbreakable Patches" you say as you walk to him and meet him in a big hug
>"What can I do for you my friend!" he says to you as your bear hug breaks
>"This is Isabelle, my parole officer. She’s needs a good FloCar, that Ritzy place downtown snuffed us and I knew where to get a good car at the best Price"
>He extends a paw to Isabelle and she shakes it
>"You should have just come here first" he says to you
>"It was my choice to go there actually" Isabelle says with a smile
>"Ah, then I can forgive him" Says Patches
>"You hook her up good Patches, or you'll answer to me" you say with a smile
>"Wait Anon, why not stay here with me? You know about FloCars and stuff" Isabelle says grabbing your jackets sleeve
>You think about it for a second as you look into her Pink eyes
>"Aight, I don't have much else to do today" you say with a smile
>She smiles and does a quick little hop as her tail wags furiously
>You spend a few hours with her and patches going through different model options before she picks on and you watch as it Materializes in the Shops Nanofactory
>A Nanofactory is a literally nanites constructing things
>It took all of 20 minutes for it to be made
>You watch as Patches and Isabelle do money stuff 
>Isabelle turns to you and Smiles
>"Thanks Anon, this FloCar is perfect! And I got a great Deal on it too!" she says
>"Hey thank Patches for the deal" you say
>Patches does finger guns at you
>Paw guns?
>Whatever
>You walk Isabelle to her new FloCar
>"Thanks again" She says smiling up at you
>"No problem Isabelle, I'll see you around" you say
>She smiles a toothy Smile hops into her FloCar as you walk to your Hoverbike
>Her FloCar then pulls out and is out of sight in about 30 seconds
>You start your bike and go to your next errand

Chapter 4: Instant Crush
>You head to the place Steven had told you to go to in the links he sent
>A Combat suit lab
>You park your bike and head inside 
>The secretary, a Chubby Anthro Ocelot girl, looks you up and down
>"Ohh well hello there Sir" she says Fluttering her eyes at you
>"How can I be of service for you today?" she emphasizes the word "I" in her sentence
>"Hey, I'm Anon, I was told to come her for a sizing for a suit by Steven at the UltraLux" you say with a smile
>You weren't gonna lie the first female attention you got since you got out of jail was flattering
>"Ah you're one of Stevens new Hires? Ok then follow me" she says with a breathy tone
>You follow her to a Lab where a Human and an old looking eagle are sitting discussing politics
>"I'm just saying that the rings government needs to be held responsible for the-- oh Hi Rhiannon, who's this?" the Eagle says looking you over 
>"This is Anon! He's here to be fitted for a Suit, Steven from the UltraLux sent him" she says before she turns to you and Winks
>Fuck, she’s laying it on hard
>"Ah yes the UltraLux" the human says before tapping on a screen in front of him 
>"Please strip down to your Underwear and step onto the platform here" he says motioning to a circular platform in the center of the room
>The Ocelot, Rhiannon, Looks at you expectedly
>You sigh 
>Fuck it
>You take off your boots first then your Jackets (you pretend not to here to "oooooo" from Rhiannon as you "accidentally" flex)
>Next comes the Tank top and Jeans leaving you in your socks and Underwear
>"I can leave the socks right?" you ask as you step onto the platform
>"Yes yes that will be fine" says the eagle as he fiddles with some knobs and buttons
>"Please stand still for us" says the human as he presses a big red button
>Suddenly you feel thousands of tiny nanites flowing across your body like sand grains
>They begin to form up and link and slowly become a Suit and tie dress uniform
>"How’s it feel? Not too tight on your arms or legs" the eagle asks
>"Or the crotch?" you hear Rhiannon Say quietly
>Why was she even still here
>"Feels good" you say taking a few stretches to ensure you had good mobility
>"Very good, you can step off the platform now" says the eagle 
>You do and Rhiannon presses a small clip into the side of the suit
>"There now you can just push this button and the suit will dematerialize" she says as she actually presses the button
>Your suit dematerializes
>"Oops" she says with a smile
>The Eagle walks (waddles? he doesn’t look like he’s great as walking on land) and hands you 2 more clips
>"These suits are used for combat purposes, they still stop Kinetic rounds, Knives and most types of projectiles" he says 
>"However they can only take 2-3 rounds from plasma weapons or lasers so be careful"
>"I'll try not to get shot" you say with a smile
>"Very good then, if you would please get dressed and Rhiannon will show you out"
>The Chubby Ocelot bounces to your side
>"Need any help there Anon"? She says with a purr
>"I'm good getting dressed thanks" you say as you pull on your Jeans
>She makes a pouty face then watches you get dressed the rest of the way
>You finish getting dressed and she leads out to the front desk
>"May I see your Holophone please?" she asks as you reach the desk
>You hand her your Holophone and she hooks it to her computer
>"Annnnd done, suits are all paid for!" she presses a few buttons on your Holophone and you see her phone go off
>She gives you a smile showing all her sharp teeth
>"Now if you have ANY troubles call me" she says
>"Any troubles?" you ask raising and eyebrow
>"ANY" she says again with a smirk
>You might just take her up on that offer
>Fuck it
>"Well then Rhiannon, there is something you could help me with, now that I think about it" you say with a confident smile
>Keep the spaghetti in the pockets man, don’t fuck up
>"Oh and what’s that Anon?" her ears perk up and her fluffy tail swishing lazily behind her
>"I could use some company for dinner tonight, how about it?"
>Spaghetti nearing overload
>She thinks for a second
>"Sure! I know this great bar on the other side of the ring that I've been meaning to go to!" 
>Spaghetti Averted I repeat spaghetti averted
>You smile "What time should I pick you up then" 
>"I get off at 5, but I'll need to go home and *ahem* freshen up, so how about 8?" 
>"That works perfectly for me" you say as you click open your phone
>She opens her and her address beeps onto your phone screen
>The ritzy side of the ring
>"Alright I'll see you then Rhiannon" you say 
>She bounces a little and smiles "I'll see you Mr. Strongman"

Chapter 5: Love hard
>Later that evening
>You're wearing your fancy clothes
>And by fancy you mean a polo shirt and jeans
>You had your jacket on over it, safety first
>You were currently riding to Rhiannon’s' place
>The scenery on this side of the ring was totally different from where you lived
>Trees in the medians
>Parks with actual grass, no hobos in sight
>You pull up to the address Rhiannon gave you and are dumbfounded
>It’s a full-fledged mansion complete with a fountain
>You have to buzz the gate to even go up the driveway
>"Hello, who is it" comes a dapper voice from the little box
>You can clearly see cameras, they know who it is
>"I'm here to take Rhiannon out for dinner" you say to the box
>"Hm very well" 
>The gate opens and you ride in
>As you pull up there is one thing apparent
>She has to be an heiress of something
>The house has to be at least 5 stories
>You dismount and head to the front doors which are at 12 feet tall at least
>Why do you need doors that big?
>The doors open automatically as you walk up to them
>Fancy
>You’re greeted by an older Male ocelot who looks like it is Rhiannon’s brother
>He looks surprised at your appearance
>"Oh uhh... you must be Rhiannon’s "date" today, you should know she and I were going to g-"
>He gets cut off by Rhiannon shouting
>"JASON FARTWHEEL, DON'T YOU TRY TO SCARE THIS ONE OFF" 
>You see Rhiannon coming down automatic stairs in a form fitting black dress
>"It’s Jason BLOODSTEEL, Rhiannon and I was just going to tell him WE were going to the bar, not you and him" he looks you over
>"What does this ruffian have that I, the great Jason bloodsteel, don't? After all I AM a famous actor" he says haughtily
>"I've never heard of you, and it may be the ego dude" you say suppressing a laugh 
>He tries to get in your face
>"Who are you to tell me that I have an ego"
>You stand up straight so he can see your full height as you tower over him 
>Looking down at him you say "The man about to take Rhiannon on a date little cat, now run along"
>He shrinks away then turns to Rhiannon furiously
>"I will be speaking to your father about this" he says before stomping off
>"Sorry about him, he gets cast in one shitty c list action movie and he thinks he’s a star" she says walking up to you
>"That was actually pretty funny" you say with a smile
>"He made up that last name too his real last name is Crinkles, my dad keeps trying to get us to go out"
>You stick out and arm and she hooks hers into yours
>"I can tell it wasn't a real last name, but Bloodsteel? Really?"
>"He thinks it sounds cool"
>You laugh 
>With all that over with you can finally get a good look at Rhiannon
>She is about 5'5, has light blond hair flowing down her back to her waist, her fur pattern reminds you of cheetah patterns but more golden
>"How do I Look Mr. Strongman?" she says, noticing you looking at her
>"You look great" 
>Her ears flick 
>You walk her outside and put your Jacket on her and give her a helmet clip
>"Ooo a Hoverbike, you're just trying to fit the "Bad boy" cliché aren't you" she says pushing you playfully
>"I guess so" you say as you mount the bike and she mounts up behind you
>She wraps her arms around you tightly 
>Her paws are rubbing over your chest as she feels your muscles
>"Like what you feel?" you say as you start the bike up
>"Oh yes" she purrs
>You put the Bar address in and your HUD lights up
>"Ready?"
>You feel a Paw squeeze your right Pec
>"Yep" 
>You pull out and head to the bar that she chose
>"This bar is a new place! It’s a total rebuild after the last place burned down" she says 
>"Cool, I've never really been to this part of the Ring though"
>"I think you'll like it"
>After about 30 minutes of talking and riding you learn a lot about her
>She's the heiress to an Anthro shampoo company CEO
>She’s 25 and has the job at the Lab just for kicks, plus her dad wanted her to have a job
>She’s an only child 
>She likes to paint and design in her free time 
>You pull up to the bar and look around
>You notice that there are LOTS of human Anthro couples around
>What?
>You park and dismount your bike and dematerialize your helmet
>Rhiannon does as well and grabs your hand with her paw and leads you to the door and pushes in happily
>There is loud music playing as she pulls you to the bar and orders a few drinks
>You weren't planning on drinking since you still had to drive but her eager eyes convince you to loosen up a bit
>"What is there to eat here" you ask the bar tender an Anthro monitor lizard
>He hands you 2 menus and you usher Rhiannon to a table and sit next to her
>"I thought dates usually sit across from each other" she says slightly surprised
>"True but this way I can be closer to you and we can actually hear each other without shouting" you say 
>"That’s very true" she says
>You spend a while eating and chatting together, she drinks quite a bit more than you do
>At about 10 She gets up and pulls you to the of the upstairs which has a holodeck game area
>"Let’s try this out Anon!" she says as she enters a small holoroom that says "Bug "B" Gone"
>You follow and see it’s a VR game where you drive around and shoot big ass bugs
>She already is in the gunner seat of the VR Jeep
>"WOOO LETS DO THIS" she yells excitedly as you get in and floor it
>You notice you get a hand gun to drive and shoot
>Rhiannon is laughing as you drive, the VR bugs exploding into goop
>You continue this until you hear a rumble behind you 
>"WOO WE'RE BEING CHASED ANON! STEP ON IT!" Rhiannon shouts 
>"I'M FLOORING IT" You yell back as you turn to face her
>You catch a quick glimpse of her Panties under her short dress
>Rainbow panties
>She looks at you and smiles
>"Like what you see Mr. Strongman?" she says with a wink
>"I Sure do Rhiannon but BUG!" you shoot a large flying bug with your handgun
>She’s back into the game shooting a large building sized bug that looks like an Ohm from the classical movie Nausica of the valley of the wind
>"GO LEFT ANON!" she yells
>"AIM FOR ITS EYES! OR THE GLOWY BITS ITS ALWAYS SHOOT THE GLOWY BITS!" you yell back as you veer to the left
>The Bug eventually Dies and you get a big PREY SLAUGHTERED Banner over your heads
>"YAY! WE DID IT" Rhiannon says as she jumps into your arms
>There is a high score list and she puts the name RandA in it
>"For Rhiannon and Anon!" she says with a bounce
>You would have put ASS
>It was close to midnight now so you leave the now closing bar/restaurant
>"I had a great time Anon! I told you that you would like it here!" Rhiannon says as she skips to your Bike
>You had to admit it was a great time
>She jumps onto your bike and begins grinding back and forth on it
>"We could have MORE fun when we get to my place" she purrs at you
>BONER ENGAGE
>You mount up and get your helmet on
>Yhe ride goes by in a flash as Rhiannon runs her soft paws under your shirt and is feeling all over your body
>A few times they are running over your ever growing erection
>You pull up to the gate and she puts her paw to it and the gate clicks open
>You pull up to the front door she leads you in
>Yhere is an older Ocelot waiting in the main room
>"OH! Hi Daddy!" she chirps at him
>Mental note: don’t let her call you daddy
>"Hm Hm so this is the human Jason was telling me about, he does indeed look like a ruffian" he has an annoying British accent that you're sure is fake
>"Daddy this is Anon! He's really fun and cool!" she defends you
>"Hm quite, well I thank you for showing my daughter a good time and bringing her home, however it is late so I must ask you to leave Anon" he says in his stupid fake accent
>"But Daddy-" Rhiannon starts
>"No buts young lady, we have a meeting with the CEO of EVERTECK in the morning and I need you looking fantastic" he says
>Goddam old man cock block
>Rhiannon turns to you and gives you a quick kiss
>"Sorry Anon" she says 
>She leans closer to you "next time for sure"
>She then escorts you to the door and leads you out
>"Have a good night Anon" she says before closing the door 
>You sigh
>Hello darkness my old friend
>You mount up and head home
>You ride for a while and then pull up to your apartment
>As you walk in the door, you feel your Holophone Buzz
>Clicking it open you see a message from Rhiannon
>"Sorry that we didn't get to have our fun, hopefully this will tide you over until next time"
>It’s a short holographic video
>You open it and it’s a full one minute long video of her playing with her pussy and tits
>That will tide you over till next time you're sure
>You beat your meat like it owes you money then go to bed with thoughts of ocelot titties in your head

>"No reloading just fire away, but it will need to be charged after 4000 shots so be weary to charge it"
>".50 Cal? Isn’t that a bit overkill" you ask as you take the pistol 
>"Not at all Titan, this is a high end casino with VERY Rich and powerful clients, we have to be prepared, a random street thug isn't going to try to rob us, they would be organized and experienced, so we have the best gear"
>"Now you get a choice for a laser rifle with grenade launcher attachment or a Plasma shotgun" he says with a calm smile
>"I'll take the plasma shotgun" you say
>The nanites get to work and in a second the Plasma Shotgun is ready
>You pick it up and he explains the features
>"It can fire a large Single blast of Plasma, or a short range scattershot of plasma, as well it is isomorphic to you" he explains
>"One more thing" he says as a sort of....glove is made
>Its finger-less and covers only your palm, it’s made of a kind of material you haven't seen before
>"We always get the new toys after the military" he says excitedly upon seeing your confusion
>"This is a "Digitizing glove", it stores your guns data and lets you "call them out" so to speak by thinking about it" he says happily
>"This way you can always be armed and ready to go" 
>"Neat" you say as you pull the glove on
>"Now just place the gun into your glove"
>You do and it ...disappears in a bunch of blue Tron strings
>You then do it to the shotgun and the same happens
>"Good now think of having the pistol in your hand"
>You do and it appears in your hand with a flash of blue
>That's pretty cool you have to admit
>"Right, the machine already took your palm print so you have access to the building and facilities" he says
>"Please put on your suit Titan"
>You click on the armored Suit and tie
>"Perfect, let me introduce you to the others" he says as he walks off
>You follow and are lead into a room where a bunch of different Anthros were lounging around
>"Everyone this is Titan, he came highly recommended, I do hope you'll help him fit in" Steven says with a smile
>You notice you're the only human in the room
>"I'll be right back with tonight’s assignments" he says as he zips off 
>A large Anthro gorilla with Cybernetic arms walks over to you
>"Titan huh" he says in a raspy digitized voice "A human who would have thought"
>He stands at about 6' even and walks with both his hands and feet
>"Well put 'ere there" he puts out a robotic hand "The names Pressure"
>You take it and shake it
>He smirks and you feel him trying to crush your hand
>Nope.Jpg
>You squeeze back with a friendly smile
>He keeps up the smirk until he hears the whining and creaking of his hand as you crush it
>His Smirk disappears
>"Aw what the fuck man!" he yells looking at his ruined hand
>A calm voice cuts through his whining
>"That's what you get Eugene, trying to intimidate without knowing anything" 
>You look over and see a large Anthro Jaguar with one cybernetic arm with what looks like fusion blades for claws
>"I have heard of this Titan before, worked for Mr.Flinn did you not?" he says as he walks over to you
>He sticks out his real Paw and you shake it
>A firm handshake but not one that's trying to crush your hand
>Just a manly greeting
>"My name is Theodore, you may call me Theo" he says with a smile
>"Pleasure to meet you, and yea, I used to work for Mr.Flinn" you say calmly
>"That explains the Nano muscle and skeletal weave mods then" 
>You narrow your eyes
>"How-?"
>He taps his left eye "lets me see Augs in living beings, I'm the Chief security officer under Steven, helps to know what people have when they walk in" he says 
>"Makes sense"
>Pressure yells from the other side of the room "This Human as Nano Muscle Augs? Goddamit no wonder he fucked up my hand"
>He's currently trying to repair the damage
>A Large Bull with one horn missing slaps you on the back with a Laugh
>"No wonder you had a high recommendation, worked for Mr.Flinn, super Rare Augs, and you're a Human, People like that! You won’t stick out too much!" he says with a sharp laugh
>"You May call me Shaxx" he says sticking out a hand
>You shake it as Steven comes back into the room
>"Alright everyone, your assignment is being sent to your earpiece, head out" he says
>"Titan I realize I forgot to give you your earpiece" he says as everyone else walks out
>He hands you an earpiece that folds over your ear and sticks into it slightly
>you put it on and a small HUD appears in your vision
>"Pretty self-explanatory right?" 
>"Yea"
>"I'll give you an easier thing tonight since it’s your first day" he says pushing a small device on his arm
>The HUD shows a route to where you’re going and tell you you're going to be a bodyguard for someone for the night
>Valkyrie North? You know that name somewhere
>You follow the route and it leads you to a room with a small star and a V in the star
>You knock and hear a soft "One moment" the door opens and you recognize the woman in front of you immediately
>She’s an Anthro bear, a porn star, not fat but pleasantly plump with some of the largest Natural jugs in the business
>You recall many nights where you had "ahem" researched her videos
>"Hm you're a new one, human too, and you're tall, I like you already" she says as she looks you up and down
>She’s wearing a dress that’s probably a size too small
>It strains to contain her....tracts of land
>"What’s your Name there sugar" she says beckoning you in
>"My Name is Anon, but some people call me Titan" you say walking into her dressing room
>She sits down and lights up a cigarette
>She offers you one which you gladly accept and light up
>"Alright then Sugar, here’s the deal, tonight I’m going to be shooting some videos with some ....special clients, understand" she says as she sits in front of her mirror
>"Sometimes the...clients get a little too rowdy, refuse to stay within the time limit, try to bring in friends, break the rules, you know" she says as she puts on some make up
>"If that happens you get to come in and toss them out, got it? 
>"Yes Ma'am" you answer
>"So polite, you must drive the ladies crazy" she says, smiling at you through the mirror
>You smile
>"I've been with a few humans, although not as....large as you are, always preferred them" she says looking you up and down again
>"If anything goes wrong you’ll get an alert on your earpiece that looks like this" 
>she presses a hidden button on her bracelet
>a large red arrow appears on the top of the HUD showing you where she is and the distance
>"Now then Sugar, let’s go this night going" she says standing up and turning to you
>"How do I look?" she says "Be honest now!"
>"You look great as always" you say smiling
>"Ah, you've seen some of my other things then" she says with a knowing smile
>Fuck
>"I might have" you say sheepishly
>"Always nice to meet a fan I guess, at least one that isn't trying to grope or fuck me" she says "I might even give you an autograph if you're good tonight, more if you can prove yourself"
>Nice
>She leads the way to a room
>"Alright sugar, the client will be arriving soon, with friends that want to watch I guess, I'll be waiting for them inside, just stay close by" she says as she places a paw on the door
>"Alright, I'll be right here" you say as you stand next to the door
>"You sure? He’s paid for 2 hours" she says as the door opens
>"If you need me I'll be able to help right away" you say with a smile
>"If you're sure then" she says as she closes the door behind her
>You're left in the hallway, standing there in an armored suit and tie
>After about 20 minutes a group of Walruses arrive and look at you, then one places a Fin? Paw? Thing? On the door
>They file through and you're again left in the hallway
>You pull out your Holophone and message Rhiannon
>"Welp I'm at work guarding a porn star, how’s your night?"
>After about 5 minutes you get a response
>"I'm with some of my girlfriends! They don't believe me when I say how tall you are! Send a holopic! PLeaseeeeee?"
>You look left and right to make sure no one’s around then a full body holopic of yourself and send it
>You get a response
>"Ooo the suit still looks good on you! thanx! xoxo!"
>"Send me their reactions" you reply
> After a minute you get a holovideo of a group of Different species of cat Anthros, a serval, a karcal, a...Pallas cat? All looking at their own Holophone with mouth agape 
>One says "Holy fuck and you went on a date with him?"
>"do you have a Dick pi-" the video cuts off
>You continue messaging her until about 30 minutes pass and the door opens, and the group of walruses walk out
>Huh
>"Sugar could you come here please" you hear Valkyrie call
>You walk into the room and...Well, you guess you can blush
>She's currently wrapped in a towel and nothing else
>"That was fast" you say "I thought he had 2 hours"
>"He did but I only got through the teasing bit where he got to feel me up, and when I was about to go down on him, he...Was a bit too excited and ruined my dress, if you know what I mean" she says with a huff
>"And here I thought I might get a little satisfaction"
>You stifle a laugh
>"I guess he overestimated himself" you say
>"I guess so, could you be a dear and grab me a new dress from my dressing room" she goes to her phone and directions appear to her room
>"Just grab a nice black one" 
>"Yes ma'am" you say as you turn and walk out of the room
>Wew lad, this is certainly interesting
>You walk to her room and grab a black dress 
>As you walk back to the room carrying the dress 2 humans walk by and stare, but you ignore them
>You arrive back at the room and knock the door opens and you walk in
>"Thanks Titan" she says takes the dress and drops the towel
>You instinctively turn around
>"Oh come now you've seen ALLLLLL of me, no need to be shy now" she cooes at you
>"That's different besides I'm still your guard for the night and it’s rude to stare" you say looking at the ceiling
>Do not focus on the bear titties
>I repeat DO NOT
>"Such a gentleman, I'm dressed now by the way" you turn around and she is in fact dressed again
>Whew
>The rest of the night goes on without any problems 
>You escorting Valkyrie room to room, messaging Rhiannon
>At the end of the night, well the morning at 4 am you escort her back to her room
>"Well Sugar our times up, next time I need a guard though, I'll make sure to request you" she says with a smile
>"Oh and"
>She rummages through a drawer and pulls out a full nude frontal of herself and signs it
>"To my favorite guard, Valkyrie North"
>She hands it to you
>You smile
>"Thank you ma'am" you say
>"One more thing, let me see your Holophone Please" she says politely
>You hesitate for a second before producing your phone and giving it to her
>She takes your phone, fiddles with it for a second, uses a claw to pull down the front of her dress a bit showing quite a bit of cleavage, then hands it back to you
>you look at your Holophone, and see her name as a contact a picture she just took showing her cleavage off
>"Now you have my number and I have yours, in case I have a rough night and need some guarding, or some refreshing politeness" she says with a naughty smile
>Did you just score a porn-stars number?
>You aren't sure if you should be impressed or not
>"See you next time" she says with a wave
>Fuck it score 1 for Anon
>You head back to the break room and sit down
>The others file in slowly
>Shaxx punches your shoulder "Good job out there rookie, I heard Ms. North took a liking to you"
>You Punch back and smile "I guess so Man"
>You think you might fit right in which these guys
>5 am rolls around and you head out after a quick debrief of things that happened
>A guy trying to steal chips
>A human trying to get up on the stage with an Anthro stripper
>Apparently the usual
>You go to the parking area, palm the scanner
>Your bike pops up, so you mount up and head home
>Traffic is nearly nonexistent at 5 am
>Arriving home you park your Hoverbike and head upstairs
>You take off all your work gear, place a your signed photo on your dresser and then pass out

>Onto the Video file
>It’s from Valkyrie
>The hologram pops up of her in a regular nightgown, although because of the size of her bust its stretched out to the point it looks like it’s going to rip
>The hologram waves
>"Hi Sugar! Just to let you know I told a few of my friends about you and what a gentleman you are so you might get requests to be their escorts"

>Fuck it, you can’t think of any other pornstars at the moment and Valkyrie is burning in your head
>You pull up a holovideo and play it
>It’s her getting rammed by a faceless Human
>You do the one armed bandit dance for a bit then get up and shower
>The sonic shower in your place isn't fancy and new but it works
>Sound waves somehow get all the dirt and grime off you or something
>You don’t know how it works
>You then turn on the water shower and get that over with

>You get your suit clips and your Digi-glove 
>You walk outside and wave to your neighbors, an Anthro owl family
>Getting on your bike and starting it, you think about what the day today will hold

>You park your Hoverbike and it’s taken into storage
>You enter the building and head to the Security staging room and see a few new faces
>"Ah the Titan Arrives!" booms Shaxx
>He walks over and slaps you on the back with a hearty Laugh
>"Let me introduce you to a few of our Friends, they aren't the Physical Security team, more of Intel!" 
>He leads you over to a Dog Anthro who has Several Data ports on his head and down his neck
>"This is Axel! He’s our head Monitor for Cameras and intel!"
>You shake his paw and stare at the ports
>He notices you looking
>"I have neural enhancement Mods, lets me link into our computer system and the cameras, as well as do quick facial recognition! Pretty neat huh wanna know how they work?" he says in a nasally voice 
>"I’m Afraid we still have things to do Axel" Says Shaxx with a gruff smile
>He then leads you to a Small bat with wires running out of the back of his head to his ears and goggles on
>"This is Drak, He is our ears out there on the floor, he usually hangs from the ceilings and listens to everything going on" 
>The bat looks at you and adjusts his goggles
>"I would shake paws but the wings are a bit sensitive" he says wiggling the little fingers on the tips of his wings
>"Its fine" you say "Nice to meet you"
>Eugene walks into the room and sits down
>"You're Late Eugene" Says Steven as he walks in from his office
>"Come on its Pressure!" Eugene protests
>"You don't get to make up your own nickname, that's not how it works" say Theo from a corner of the room 
>"Titan did!" Eugene says with a frown
>"No, I believe he got that from Mr.Flinn and it makes sense, yours doesn't" says Shaxx
>Eugene Mumbles and stomps over to a corner 
>"Alright now that that's out of the way your assignments are being sent to your earpieces, dismissed" Steven says 
>Your HUD from the earpiece pings up a small list
>You are working with Shaxx on the Main Casino floor
>"HAHA YES! I get to show you the ropes" he Says with an all too eager smile
>You follow him to an elevator that takes you up to the main floor
>"Being an escort for the ladies may be a good Job but our main excitement is in the Casino" he says as the door open
>You're hit by a wave of flashing lights and dinging, beeping or Buzzing sounds
>There is a Garble of voices everywhere and never dying down at all
>There are Waitresses, Humans and Anthros, in tiny Miniskirts and small button up shirts that show off cleavage traveling from Gambler to gambler getting tips and bringing drinks
> "AH YES! Breathe it all In Titan!" he Booms above the noise
>"How does Drak hear anything here?" you ask
>"Very carefully" says Drak’s voice in your earpiece
>You look around for him
>"To your left, and up" says Axels voice in your earpiece
>You look in the directions and see Drak Attached to the ceiling
>Fuck that's weird
>"Hey Shaxx, I see someone at Blackjack table 7 stealing chips" Axel says
>"Profile says he has a Warrant for assault with a deadly weapon and possible murder, might want to be careful"
>"Careful?? I have Titan with me! We can handle it together" Shaxx Yells
>He was very loud and enthusiastic for sure
>He leads the way as you make mental maps of the area
>You knew you would be working this again, so might as well get to know where everything is
>"Which one Axel" you say
>"One directly across from the Dealer, the... is that a Komodo dragon or a Monitor Lizard? Whatever, the big lizard in the stupid Puffy coat" Axels voice directs you
>"I think that's a komodo dragon" you hear Drak say
>"Shut up goggles, you're blind as fuck" says Axel
>"Gentlemen, can we focus" says Shaxx
>He wasn't yelling or enthusiastic now
>You could tell he was steeling himself
>Even if this Lizard was unarmed he would still has Very, very, sharp teeth and probably wouldn't go quietly
>"Authorities have been notified Shaxx, your move" Axel says calmly
>"Titan go around the table to the left, I'll go right and confront him, if he tries to run stop him, if he tries to fight, drop him" Shaxx directs
>"Got it" you say as you move
>It’s easy for people to overlook you here
>Many Anthros were tall and in this crowd of Anthros and humans you could disappear despite your size
>You watch as Shaxx confronts the Komodo, and asks him for the stolen chips
>The Komodo denies it of course
>"We have Video proof of you stealing from us Mr. Anderson, the Authories have already been notified and are heading this way, I suggest you stay quiet and allow us to take you to a holding room until they arrive, we don't want this to go further than it has to" Shaxx explains calmly
>The Komodo looks like he is thinking for a second then Turns from Shaxx and Books it
>Right into you
>"Watch it Human" he hisses before he realizes you were there to stop him
>He growls and reaches into his coat and pulls out a expandable Baton
>He snaps it open with a *CLICK*
>"Move or I make you" he hisses 
>"Wait until he swings at you Titan, then he can't say you attacked him" you hear axels voice
>The Komodo Lunges at you but you jump back and he swings wide, losing balance because he overcommitted to the swing
>You use this moment to simply Punch him in the side of his head, where, if he were human, his temple would be
>He’s out like a bag of Space potatoes
>"HAHA I KNEW YOU COULD DO IT!" Shaxx booms as he walks over and places electomag Handcuffs on the komodo
>You Pick up the out cold lizard and throw him over your shoulder
>"Where do I go with him" you ask Shaxx
>"This way Titan" he says with a point and leads the way
>"Titan I know you have strength but you lack technique" he says as he walks
>"How about you come to my gym every Wednesday and train with me? We could get you fighting like a pro in no time"
>"Uh.... Sure why not?" you say with a bit of hesitation
>"EXCELLENT!" he booms!
>You're leads to a small holding room where you toss the Lizard 
>After about 10 minutes the police arrive and confirm he is wanted for murder 
>The police take statements from you and Shaxx and get a copy of the video
>The rest of the night goes by without a hitch as Shaxx shows you around and where hotspots for things are
>At the end of the shift in the breakroom there is a video playing on repeat of you punching the lizard in the Head
>"Nice one Titan" says Steven "first day and you take down a murderer in a one punch, impressive, as well tomorrow one of the Ladies has requested you as an Escort, Ms. Jane Edwards, or Janet Diamond. That’s her stage name"
>Why does that name sound familiar?
>You download the Video of you punching the lizard and send it to Rhiannon
>She sends you back a Video Message 
>"OHMYGOSH THAT’S COOL! I'm Gonna sent it to all my friends! Good job Mr. Strongman! Sorry I couldn't stop by but it looks like I would have just gotten in the way! Seeya!"
>You get you bike out and rev it up
>The sun is starting to come up as you ride and pull into your apartment complex
>You head inside and sit down and relax for a while, while Messaging Rhiannon
>Jane Edwards....You know that name.....
>You finally give in and google her stage name
>What you see blows your Mind
>It’s a girl, you knew
>More specifically, one of your girlfriends from high school

>"Authorities confirmed that Phillip Anderson was wanted for murdering his Ex-wife and for attacking her Then boyfriend with a pipe"
>"Impressive" Says Ronnie
>"How come no one sees the cool stuff I do?" whines Eugene
>"Because you touch yourself at night" quips Drak
>You see Eugene lunge for him and Drak fly away laughing
>You head out and Ronnie is with you as you walk
>"Some of the lesser known ladies share dressing rooms, I'm not following you, don't worry" he says with a smile

>You hug her back
>"Hey Jane" you say simply
>"Been a while"
>She's a brilliantly colored golden tiger
>You look her over, she’s Curvaceous as she had always been, but you could see she had a lot of strength in her muscles as she walked over to her desk
>She’s wearing a red Strapless dress that barely contains her DD cup breasts
>You think back to her in high school
>Then she was a total nerd, played MTG and all that Jazz
>You never could understand that game, even after she explained it to you several times
>You could get behind the video games she recommended though
>"How have you been Anon? Finally out of the....job you had before?" she says with a slight pause
>One of the reasons she had left you was because of you working with The Boss
>"Yea I'm done with that and I've been ok, just got out of Jail and trying to turn my life around" you answer, scratching the side of your face
>She stops what she was doing to look at you "Jail? Why didn't anyone tell me?"

>"Yea man" you say ask you take one out of the pack then toss the pack to him
>You light yours up, then toss him the lighter as he tosses back the pack
>He lights up and tosses it back to you
>"Sweet man thanks"
>You give him a thumbs up and take a drag of your smoke
>"Alright Anon, my rules are different then Valkyrie's, you stay in the room with me because it’s a large party. No touching allowed unless I give permission" she explains
>"I have one large event tonight so you'll be with me all night"
>Easy enough
>You finish your cigarette and smash it into an ashtray
>She finishes up getting ready and leads you out of the room
>You fistbump Ronnie as you leave
>"Take care man"
>You follow Jane to an executive meeting room
>The sign on the door says "Private party only"
>Looks like they brought their own security too
>Jane goes to a small side room with a bunch of different outfits for her to swap into throughout the night
>Nurse outfit, Maid, some weird cosplay weeby thing you don't recognize
>"Alright the event starts in 30 minutes, find a place to stay close to me but out of the way" she says as she riffles through the outfits
>You nod and start walking around the room
>Hardwood Floors, a large balcony overlooking the City, a stage where Jane will be dancing as the clients mingle with each other
>It looked like she was just a stripper for the night
>You find a spot near the stage and set a chair there
>No need to stand all night
>The event starts
>Jane is on stage dancing and stripping
>You recall your time with her in high school
>Her fur on your Skin
>Her tits, which you were able to see now, wrapped around your dick
>Her soft ass pressed against your crotch
>The naughty whispers you two shared in the hallways
>Needless to say, you missed having her with you
>But you needed money and no one cared about the lone human boy trying to find a job in beast town
>You watch her through the night, trying to hide your boner from the clients
>She really was something else
>When the pole came out of the floor and she started pole dancing you could see the trained muscles rippling under her curves
>Most of the room was also transfixed by her movements
>The event drew to a close and the people started shuffling out
>A few tried to get Jane's Number and tried to flirt but she shut them down 
>"I only do private shows honey" she said to the Anthro lion who asks for a "mating session"
>Why did he call it that?
>You walk her back to her dressing room
>Chika is there and Ronnie is trying to her help wipe her fur clean
>"OH MY GOD SO MUCH JIZZ" she shouts as she tries to wipe it out of her fur
>"That’s what happens when you only do Bukkake Chika" says Jane
>"Yea but the tips I get are hella dope" 
>You look at Ronnie
>He has gloves over his paws
>He shrugs at you and continues trying in vain to help Chika clean up
>Ew
>You follow Jane and sit down behind her as she begins to wipe off her Make up
>"Thanks Anon, I know it was probably boring for you but I felt better with you there, sometimes they get handsy" she says as she wipes of her eyeliner
>No Problem Jane, and it wasn’t boring...I... Enjoyed the show myself"
>Jane's ears Flutter and her tail swishes and wraps around your leg
>She smiles at you through her mirror
>"It’s good to see you again Anon" she says with the nervous smile you've known for so long
>"yea, it’s good to see you too" you say rubbing her tail gently
>It send small shivers up her spine
>You knew she loved tail pets
>You pull out your Holophone
>"Can I get your Number? We can play video games together like old times" you say, smiling
>She gives you her number and you send her a message so she has yours too
>You can see Ronnie looking over envious
>She stand up and hugs you
>"I’ll see you around Anon, have a good morning" she says 
>"You too Jane"
>You leave her dressing room and start the walk back to the staging area
>You think about Janes dancing, her body, and the touch of her fur
>"Yo Titan wait up!" Ronnie jogs over to you
>"You know Janet? How?" he says wheezing a little "Fuck, you walk fast dude"
>"Huh? Oh Jane?" you take a moment to remember her stage name
>"We…We dated in high school, and for a bit after" you say as you walk
>"YOU dated HER!? You let THAT get away? You crazy man" he says
>"She ended it because of my....work" you say
>"Huh? What work? Military?" he asks
>"Organized crime" 
>"Oh yea that'll do it" he says looking ahead
>"You seem fairly fond of Chika, or at least she seems fairly into you Ronnie" you say with a smirk
>"Yea she is, it’s just.... How do you get with a girl who's main claim to fame is she swallowed like 50 cumshots in an evening? I mean even today like 20 guys came on her" he says with a sigh
>"Not exactly a girl you can take home to mother aye?" you laugh
>"Yea man" he says
>You enter the staging area and take a seat
>It was a relatively quiet night all around
>You're dismissed and you head home
>Jane always liked spending time with you
>And you liked spending time with her
>She occupies your thoughts as you get home and relax
>Tomorrows your day off. Maybe you could do something with her?
>You doubt it, you have to have Isabelle over and you don't want to explain that awkwardness
>You shitpost for a while on the threads and look up a few games to play later
>You look at you Holophone re-watch the holomessage Valkyrie sent you
>God those tits are out of this world too
>Its getting late
>You turn in for the night and hope you can dream about Jane

Chapter 9: Best Friend
>It’s your first day off since you started working at the UltraLux
>Your sleep schedule is kinda funky but you had things to do
>One of your few human friends is over
>Chase is sitting at your computer Smoking a cigarette
>You had met him while working for the Boss
>He was a low level dealer at the time and the Boss wanted you to give him a bit of protection
>His Jokes were very movie and Music specific 
>You had to know the specific song he was talking about or they would sail over your head 
>He was currently browsing the threads you had up
>"Yo what’s with all these people trying to date Anthros dude? Are they really that much better than humans?" he says
>He has the cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth while he talks
>"Uhh I guess so, I’ve never actually dated a human though" you say as you scoot your non recliner next to him so you could see what he was referring too
>The thread is talking about how best seduce an Anthro
>There were responses ranging from "FUCK HER RIGHT IN THE PUSSY" to get specific pheromones for the species
>"Dude really? Like never? I thought you would have ladies all over you cuz of the" he makes motion above his head
>"Yea Anthros though" you say lighting up a cigarette of your own and taking a drag
>"Huh that’s pretty neat" he says slumping back into the chair
>You feel your Holophone go off
>You click it open and Isabelle’s hologram Appears
>"Hey Anon! Wondering if now was a good time for me to stop by? I need to do my weekly check in!" she says waving to you
>"Whoa she’s cute" says Chase
>"Come on dude" you say
>"Yea now is a good time, just knock and I’ll let you in when you get here"
>"Ok see you in a bit then" she says before the hologram clicks off
>"Dude how do you get the cuties like that?" Chase asks as he smashed his cigarette into and ashtray 
>You shrug
>"I Dunno man but I don’t think I have a chance with her anyway, she’s my Parole officer" you say
>"Oh please you lanky fuck, in the last week you’ve gotten 3 Holophone numbers! 2 of them from pornstars! PORNSTARS DUDE!” he says running a hand through his hair
>"Yea 2 of them are for professional reasons though" 
>"BS I saw that video the Bear sent you, professional my ass" 
>Huh
>He's got a point
>You both go back to browsing threads until there is a soft knock at your door
>"Open" you say 
>The door Slides open with a slight whoosh sound
>Isabelle walks in and looks around
>"Huh, smaller than I thought it would be" she says
>She has her hair up in a ponytail today and is wearing a black button up shirt with khaki pants
>Those buttons look like they are gonna shoot of at any moment
>"Hi to you too Isabelle" you say 
>"Hey Anon, Who's this?" she says looking at Chase
>"Oh, this is an old buddy of mine, he just wanted to see me after I got out of jail"
>He waves lazily and continues browsing the threads
>You shake your head at him
>"What? she’s here for you man, not me!"
>Isabelle looks around at your apartment
>"I would ask if you’re hiding anything but... you have almost nothing here! I think I have more in my house already" she says with her eyebrows raised
>"Yea, I just have what I need" you say looking around
>"Mind if I look around really quick?" she asks 
>"Standard protocol" 
>You shrug
>"Sure"
>She walks into your bedroom and looks around
>"Signed nude of a pornstar, classy Anon" she says looking at the photo Of Valkyrie
>Spaghetti time
>"Oh that uh...She gave it to me after I was a guard for her last week" you mutter
>"Mhm sure, you totally didn’t order it" she says walking back into the main room
>"By the way, Anon do you know any good Mexican places? I’ve been dying for some good Mexican food and the Biodispenser burritos just don’t cut it" she asks
>"Hmm yea I do, probably not as fancy as you’re used to though" you says scratching your head
>"Whatever let’s go!" she says grabbing your arm
>You look at Chase
>He does the same lazy wave
>"Peace dude" he says as he picks up a controller for video gaming
>This fucking guy
>You leave Chase and follow Isabelle and she gets into her FloCar
>You pause
>"What’s wrong?" she calls from inside of it
>"I don’t know if I’ll fit" you say
>"WELL only one way to find out doofus! Get IN" she says 
>Bossy little wolf
>You duck in and scrunch in as best you can
>Fuck this is a small car
>You put the address in and the car lifts off and zips to the destination
>The ride is quieter than your Hoverbike
>"I thought you said you were the only Human that was out here in the Slums" Isabelle says 
>You strain to turn to look at her
>"Wha? Oh Chase? He doesn’t live here. He lives Downtown in a Trailer By the factories, he’s like their maintenance man or something"
>"Oh well what about your family? Where do they live?"
>You sigh
>"I don’t have a family Isabelle, I grew up in the Anthro Slums because I was left at the orphanage there" you say looking out the window of the car
>"Oh.....I’m sorry Anon" she says 
>Her ears go flat to her head
>"Like I said, no choice to grow up there" you say 
>"Anyway we're here"
>The car Parks itself and you pull yourself out of the tiny car
>Isabelle gets out easily
>You’re in front of a small Mexican restaurant that has a sign that says "taqueria"
>Walk in and a wave of smells hits you
>Asada, Salsa, Pollo and Jalapenos
>You see a Hooded Lizard and call out to him
>"Hey Jorge!"
>He starts and looks up
>"Hey Titan! Heard you went to prison!" he says walking over to you with his awkward gait
>You shake his scaly hand
>"This is Isabelle, she’s new to the ring and wanted some good Mexican food, so here we are!" you say
>He smiles
>"You came to the right place then Amiga!" he says shaking her paw
>"Where can we sit?" you ask
>"Anywhere!" he motions around him
>You sit down at a booth and Isabelle slides in opposite of you
>"You know everyone" She says shaking her head
>"I know a lot of people around here, yes"
>"By the way, I’ve been meaning to ask you, what’s with the pink?" You motion to her hair
>"Is it dyed? Are those contacts?"
>She laughs
>"I had genetic re-sequencing done for my 18th birthday" she says with a smile
>Genetic re-sequencing was a procedure that allowed people and Anthros to change things, hair color, eye color, height, metabolic rate etc.
>But it was expensive
>Wery very expensive
>"Geez and you said my Augs were expensive and you had something like that done? Why Pink?"
>"Well I-"
>She’s interrupted by a small Chihuahua Anthro waitress
>"Hola! What can I get you two" she says in a very high pitched voice
>You look at your menu
>"I’ll have 3 asada Quesadillas and 2 asada Burritos and water, let me get those quesadillas to go though, ok Verónica?
>"Ok Titan, and for you Miss?" she yips at Isabelle
>"Uhh an asada Burrito and some water as well please" Isabelle says looking at her menu
>"Anyway My Father said I could get anything I wanted when I turned 18, and pink is my favorite color, so I decided to change my eye and hair color" she says with a happy smile 
>You look at it
>"It is very pink" you say with your eyebrows raised
>"So how’s the ring treating you so far? Any new parolees?" you ask
>"Yea I have a few new ones I meet later this week, hopefully no one you know"
>You shrug "Maybe"
>"And as for the ring, my neighbors are really nice and invited me dinner the other day! They are humans too! They were really nice and have a kid! He kept trying to pet me though...."
>You laugh
>"Kids do that, especially ones who haven’t really ran into Anthros before" you say with a sad smile
>"What do you mean? He grew up on the ring. He should have seen plenty of Anthros" she says in a worried tone
>"That neighborhood is very....Human, there are Anthros on the ring but we aren’t really seen as first rate citizens" you say scratching your neck
>"You mean they right?" she asks
>"Huh?"
>"You said "we" not "they" when referring to Anthros" she says
>Your food arrives and Verónica hands you a bag and a you hand her your Holophone
>"Done all paid for! Enjoy your meal" she says before zipping off to help another table
>"Yea well like I said I grew up surrounded by Anthros, I never really saw myself as different from them I guess" you say before taking a huge bite of your burrito
>Isabelle bites into her and makes a doofy face of pleasure
>"Ohh goddddd, I needed a good burrito" she says before scarfing it down
>She looks at yours
>You sigh and cut your second burrito in half before finishing your meal
>She sighs and rubs her stomach
>"I think I ate too fast" she says with a small burp
>"No shit Sherlock" you say with a smile
>"Let’s go, I have some things to do later" you say as you stand up
>"What do you have to do?" She says looking surprised
>"I have a date" you answer
>Her ears go flat for a second
>Or did they? Is she disappointed that you have a date? 
>Nah can’t be that
>She was just surprised that’s all you’re sure of it
>With that Isabelle takes you home and waves
>"See you next week Anon!" she says with a smile before the car drives off
>You head upstairs and see Chase let himself out 
>And had drank all your Dr.Pepper™
>goddamit Chase
>But you weren’t focusing on that
>You click open your Holophone and replay the Message from Rhiannon
>"Hey there Mr. Strongman, have I got a date planned out for us today"
>Fuck yea

Chapter 10: I don't even care about you
>You dress calmly into your fancier clothes
>Granted it’s just black jeans and a short sleeve button down 
>But it'll do the trick for tonight
>Rhiannon, bless her Feline soul, had planned out a date for you both
>You hope it isn't too expensive but then think back to her grandiose mountain of a home
>The place probably had over 40 rooms 
>If she wanted to you're sure she could buy anything on this ring
>But she had other plans 
>You look in the mirror
>Still tall
>Still muscular
>Still....You
>As much as you hated it 
>You would you like yourself?
>Your own parents didn't want you, so much so they didn't even find a human orphanage to drop you at
>But you couldn't change that
>Now you were a lone human in the middle of an Anthro slum
>Dressing for a date with an Anthro that deserved better
>Humans were foreign to you
>And you still were uncomfortable around them to no end
>Anthros were an open book
>You could tell if they were lying from their ears or tails
>If they really wanted you around
>Humans... Pretend
>They act friendly
>Act like they care then...A knife in your back
>You shake your head to free these thoughts
>You were about to go on a date with a beautiful Ocelot
>You leave your apartment and mount up on your Hoverbike and set off

>The ride is cool and peaceful
>You click the clip of your helmet
>The plas-steel dissolves leaving your head bare
>You breathe in deep
>The rushing wind, the fresh air
>You look up and see the other side of the ring, the side you had looked up at as a child and pledged you would live there one day
>So ritzy, so refined, streets of gold they told you
>But life has other plans for a giant among Anthros
>You sigh and smell the cool air as it rushes past you
>Were you good enough for all this?
>When you were with the boss, everything seemed right
>The hiding, the drugs...the violence
>While you never liked hurting innocent people, if someone came at you
>You hurt them
>And you enjoyed it
>How dare they try to hurt you?
>Just like every school bully you had ever known
>And you crushed them
>Bones broke
>Blood spilled
>And in the end you stood, bloodied but standing
>And you loved it


>You rub your face and try to wipe away that darkness within
>It doesn’t need to see the light of day
>Better buried deep within your soul, even if it tried to claw its way out
>It was better hidden
>From the world, from Jane, from Valkyrie... from Isabelle
>You tap the clip of your helmet and it rematerializes
>Safety first you guess
>The ride had taken you to Rhiannon’s house gates
>You're let in with a bit of a hassle
>"Ah you again" said the voice through the speaker
>"Me again" you grimaced
>You had never been a ladies man
>Despite your size, strength and connections you never really got with the ladies
>Either you were just too...You
>Or you were just oblivious to their advances
>But Rhiannon came on so strong even the most idiotic guy would have noticed
>You think about it all for a moment as you park and walk through those oversized doors
>Was she like this with everyone? Did she "like" you to spite her Father and that dickhead Jason?
>Your head is spinning with questions until you hear her voice as you enter the mansion
>"Hey Mr. Strongman! Ready for our date?" she’s walking to you with a purple tube top on and a mini skirt
>And you had dressed nice
>"Hey Rhiannon! Of course I’m ready. What’s this date you have planned out?"
>You hug her and she sneaks in a quick kiss to your cheek
>"Secret!"
>She grabs your hand and pulls you to an overly fancy looking FloCar 
>"Come on! This will be so much fun!"

>The FloCar Zips through Traffic as you sit with Rhiannon
>You never quite liked not being in control but it had its advantages
>For one, Rhiannon was all over you
>First, in your lap
>Then laying her head in your lap 
>Then she had pushed you over and laid on you
>The whole while chatting about her friends and their dates, how they were jealous of her 
>You never even got a chance to get a word in
>"We're here!" she says pulling you
>You step out of the FloCar onto....a field?
>Fields are rare and usually in the fancier parts of the ring
>In front of you was a view Pod
>Wiew pods are basically short range space ships, able to achieve low orbit
>Think space hot air Balloon
>"YAY! THISLL BE FUN" Rhiannon is sprinting to the Pod and pulling open the door to it
>You walk up pensively 
>"How did you arrange this?" you ask
>She climbs into it and beckons you in
>"Daddy owns this! I can take it whenever I want! Come on!" 
>You climb into it and see her fiddling with buttons
>"WEEEE" She says 
>You're nearly pressed into the floor as the pod Zips skyward
>"HOLY FUCK" you shout as you catch yourself with your hands
>She’s laughing
>"Warn me next time!" you snap angrily
>"Nope!" she giggles
>You look out the window and see the ring spinning slowly through space
>A glowing jewel against the void
>You had never seen it like this
>A simple ring, floating through space, not around the star of Alpha Centauri
>Rhiannon giggles and fidgets with a few more buttons
>"Ever been in zero Gravity?" 
>"Uh no I...FUCK!" you're floating off the floor
>She pushes herself off the wall with her footpaws and tackles you
>"You're MINE Mr. Strongman!" she says before pulling you into a kiss
>You feel her raspy tongue push into your mouth
>She breaks from the kiss and smiles
>"Wanna join the thousand mile high Club?" she says as she pulls her tube top off
>Her orange sized breasts spill into view
>She presses them together
>"Like what you see?" she giggles at you
>You don’t answer but instead cup them softly and give a small squeeze
>"I’ll take that as a yes"
>You’re both floating in the center of the pod spinning gently as you help her undress the rest of the way
>She in turn helps you
>She pulls off your jeans and looks expectedly at your undergarments
>"Mmmm kitty wants to see what Strongman is packing" she purrs
>You slide out of them and Rhiannon purrs louder
>"Oh Mr. Strongman, how did you hide this from me that first day?" she asks placing a paw around your erection
>Your fingers run through the fur on her side
>"I have my ways" you say before sucking one of her bright pink nipples
>"Mmmm bite it" she purrs as she strokes your erection
>You bite it softly and squeeze her other breast
>"Mmm Gimme this" she moves herself against you until she’s breathing on your Shaft
>You get a view of her Pussy, shimmering slightly with wetness
>"Mind if I get a taste?" she asks
>She doesn’t wait for an answer
>Her mouth closes around the hip and you feel her tongue dances softly on you
>Her paw strokes it as she licks and suck gently
>You would like to lick her but your neck doesn’t quite bend that far down
>Instead you opt for your fingers
>With your left arm around her waist, you reach with your right hand and rub your thumb against her clit softly
>"Mmmm harder" she moans before going back to sucking your member
>Her tongue runs up and down your shaft
>You press your thumb in harder and move it in a circular motion
>You feel her moan and purr on your cock
>She pushes her head down before coming back up and gasping slightly
>"Mmmm Mr. Strongman you’re too big... I can’t get all of you in my mouth" her paw rubs and strokes you
>You smirk at that
>Her wetness invites your fingers into it
>Slowly and gently you slide 2 fingerings into her warmth
>>"Mhmmm just like that Anon, use those big hands of yours" she moans before taking you back into her mouth
>Alternating curling your fingers
>A soft tongue running up and down your shaft
>Gentle vibrations from heavy purring
>You both spin in the center of the pod, gravity forgotten
>She pulls off you and spins herself back to face you
>"Mmmm I want the main event, enough foreplay" she purrs before kissing you
>She positions herself on you and you slide in with little effort
>She wraps her arms and legs around you
>You feel her walls contracting and tensing up and she shudders slightly
>"S-so big" she moans into your ear
>You grab her by the hips and start moving her slowly
>Her paws on your back and the back of your head
>She moans happily
>"Harder Strongman, break me with your big human cock"
>You pump into her harder, ignoring the "break" part
>She’s shivering and shuddering
>"MMMMM YESANONJUSTLIKETHAAAA" she cries as her claws dig into your back 
>You wince slightly and keep going with renewed vigor
>"YESYESYESYESYESSSSSSS" She screams into space
>Her walls convulse and clamp down
>"Rhiannon I’m" 
>"GIVE IT TO ME!"
>Her claws dig deeper into your back as you release all the pent up frustration into her
>"YESSSSSSSSSSSS" She moans loudly before going limp, shivering and shuddering in pleasure
>You hold her and pat her head 
>That was a fun date

>You're sitting in Rhiannon’s FloCar going back to her mansion
>She leans against you purring and rubbing your leg with her paw
>"So what does this make Us Rhiannon? Is this the official "we're a couple" thing" you ask as you lazily pet her head
>Her ears go flat
>Oh no
>"Uhmm...it’s just that I’m not really looking for a relationship like that, more just friends...with benefits!" she says with a apologetic smile
>You think quietly
>She is fun to hang with and such, and if she decides she wants to date you later you could
>You sigh and smile
>"Ok Rhiannon, we can do that" you say
>You admit you were a little disappointed
>SHUT UP EMOTIONS GET BACK IN YOUR HOLE!
>You mentally stomp your emotions down like Edward Norton stomping a black guy into the curb
>She smiles at you and kisses you softly
>"Thanks for understanding, you really are a great guy"
>You both sit and listen to the gentle humming of the FloCar
>This wouldn’t be so bad...Maybe
>After a bit, you arrive at her mansion and she gets out and gives you a goodbye kiss
>"Let’s have another date your next day off!" she says with a smile 
>"Goodnight Mr. Strongman!"
>She goes inside, leaving you to get on your Hoverbike and start it up
>You start the ride home
>Thoughts creep their way into your head
>What did you expect?
>She’s an heiress and a multimillionaire
>You're a parolee bodyguard who protects pornstars 
>How could she want a relationship with you
>Stupid Anon STUPID
>You were just a living sex toy to piss of her father 
>A different voice creeps in
>She’s still a nice girl who genuinely likes you though
>There’s a chance she'll eventually want you
>But there’s also a chance she'll just string you along
>And with that string would be you stringing every other potential mate...err... girl along
>You’re frustrated and mad
>You want to try to make a relationship work
>But don’t want to be a boy toy to be shown off to her friends
>You wrestle with your thoughts as you park and head inside
>One thing was for certain tomorrow
>You were going to enjoy hitting some unlucky fuck tomorrow as you trained with Shaxx

Chapter 11: Animal
>He's there on the floor
>You stand over his whimpering cowering form 
>Your bloodied knuckles shimmering is his blood or yours
>But he deserves more, far more
>Your eyes burn red with anger
>What more could you do?
>He-hel-"
>He’s cut off
>You stomp on his head
>The voice in the back of your head whispers
>"Do more, he deserves it, no one else will do it"
>Another voice
>"This isn’t right the cops wil-"
>"The cops don’t care about us, they never did"
>"Do it again"
STOMP
>"Again"
STOMP
>You continue stomping until the whimpering stops
>Then you stomp some more
>When at last you can’t even lift your leg you kneel next to the body and roll it over
>"How could you do this to me"
>Oh god it’s her
>"You let this happen it’s your fault"
>You close your eyes and cover your ears 
>But the voice, eerily calm bores in
>"Your fault"
>"No" you sob softly
>"Your fault"
>"No please"
>"YOUR FAULT"

>"NO" you yell sitting up
>You’re in your bed, panting hard
>It’s been a while since you had that nightmare
>You rub your face and get up
>"Time"
>"The time is 6 am"
>You go to your bathroom and look in the mirror
>Heavy bags under your eyes
>You shake your head and jump into the shower
>The vibrations and then the hot water help with your body feeling awful
>It does nothing for your head though
>Your look at your phone and see a message from Shaxx on it
>You click it open and a hologram of the one horned bull pops up
>"Titan! I look forward to trading punches with you today!"
>Such enthusiasm 
>"Enclosed with this message is the address of the Gym and what you should wear!"
>The hologram clicks off and you see the directions and what to wear
>Basic sports clothes
>You sigh and grab a bowl and have the Biodispenser create some cereal
>You change and head out 

>The fog of the ring is bad this morning
>A pearly white sheen over your vision
>You feel the dampness on your body hair as condensation forms
>You look out at the city for a moment
>Then around at the slums you knew and grew up with
>You think about how the cops never even come to this side of the ring
>How things have gotten pretty bad out there 
>But what could you do?
>Hurt people, it’s what you’re good at anyway
>Guess it was time to get better at it

>You park next to the gym and double check the address
>Yea this is it
>The words "the Crucible" in bright red letters glow through the fog
>You head inside and look around
>You had never really been to a formal gym
>You used the one in the jail of course but that was more to kill time
>This was a boxing gym punching bags lines the walls, a ring in the center
>"AHA YES TITAN! BREATHE IT ALL IN" booms Shaxx as he walks over to you
>He puts an arm over your shoulder and leads you around
>"This is the Crucible! Here we train and fight each other so that when the REAL threats come we will be Ready!"
>"Now then, to see where we need to start you in training we need to see what you know"
>He leads you to an area of the gym where tapes and boxing gloves are hanging
>You weren’t really feeling it but god dam his enthusiasm for hitting things was so high
>He tapes up your hands and shows you how to do it right
>"Alright Show me a fighting Stance Titan" he instructs
>You get into a stance 
>Fists up, feet apart
>"Stagger your feet, your dominant on in the back, fists Cover your mouth and chin! Higher!
>He circles you
>"Ah right handed, that makes it simpler! Left fist in front!
>He drills you on your punches and your stance for 3 hours straight
>At the end he hands you a few Datachips
>"Looks like we’re going to have to start from the basics" 
>You frown at that
>"It’s nothing to be ashamed of Titan! Everyone starts at the beginning! It’s how far you want to go that matters!" he says as he gives you a heavy slap on the back
>"I will see you tomorrow! I’ll make sure you don’t have to go onto the floor since those chips are gonna give you a headache like nothing else!"
>Great
>You thank him and head home

>The fog has let up a bit
>The wind growls as you cut a ribbon through it with your Hoverbike
>You feel your bike and listen to the roar it makes
>You think back to the words Rhiannon told you
>"Just friends"
>Granted it was with Benefits but... that’s not what you had wanted
>But again what did you expected
>Why do you care so much?
>You got your dick wet didn’t you? And you could whenever you wanted
>A voice in your head whispers what you didn’t want to think though
>"You don’t just want sex though, you want more"
>"You know you deserve more than that"
>But did you?
>You shake your head to try to rid those thoughts from your head
>"You know it’s true" the voice says before disappearing
>You sigh and pull off onto a side street near your apartment
>Fuck...
>Why couldn’t it just be easy?
>You pull into your spot and notice something
>Isabelle’s car?
>You head insides and yep, there's Isabelle
>"Hey Anon! How did the date go?" she says as she leans back in your chair
>"It was ok, but Isabelle what are you doing here?"
>She twiddles her footpaws on the floor
>"I uh... have to so a check every once and a while that’s not prearranged... and uhh... you're like the only friend I have here" she says with her ears flat against her head
>You sigh and kick off your shoes
>"What happened to stay professional?" you ask as you set the Datachips down and grab a drink 
>"That went out the window when you helped me so much, so how was the date?"
>You frown
>What do you say to her about it?
>That you found a fuck buddy?
>"We went in a viewpod and had a good time together, but she told me she doesn’t want a relationship, so I guess that’s that"
>Yea be vague, that’s good
>"Aww sorry to hear that, well there are other fish in the sea" she says with her ears perked up and her tail wagging slightly
>She’s not unhappy about your failed date huh? 
>You sit on one of the kitchen table chairs
>"So what’s the sheltered little wolf want to know about now?"
>"I’m not sheltered and I’m NOT little" she protests
>"You don’t know how insurance works, you don’t know how to use a helmet clip, you don’t know how to hook up a Biodispenser" you list off the reasons on your fingers "seriously the plugs are color coded"
>Her ears go flat again
>"Ok maybe a little sheltered... but I’m not little!"
>"You are to me"
>She crosses her arms and sits back with a slight "Hmpf"
>You smile at her
>"You know I’m only teasing you right?" 
>Her ears perk up a little
>"Uh.....yes... I totally knew that" she says not looking you in the eye
>Mhm
>"Actually I had a question about the orphanage you lived at Anon"
>"Oh?"
>"What was it like?"
>You think back to it
>The Anthro Pallas cat who had “raised" you had passed away years ago
>Most of your "brothers" and "sisters" were either dead, in jail, or you haven’t heard from them since they left
>"It was… Bad... we , uhh , the other orphans and I, banded together when we were young, we needed to, it was us against the ring, then we grew up and learned even if we stick together we get hurt" you say looking into your drink
>"Anthros bullied us at the schools, humans bullied us if we left the slums, it wasn’t until I got big that I fought back"
>You thought about some of the bullies, they were teenagers when you finally stood up to them, 
>After you hurt one, you hunted the others down... and hurt them
>Then you asked your brothers and sisters who hurt them
>And you continued
>Until...
>You snap back to looking at Isabelle
>"That’s what the orphanage was like" you say with a false smile
>Her ears are flat
>"Oh...S-sorry Anon" she says looking down
>Isabelle continues to ask you about things around the ring
>The Slums
>The UltraLux
>The politics
>It isn’t until almost 4 she decides to leave
>You needed to turn in early anyway
>Work started at 9 and you were going to have a rough night with these Datachips

Chapter 12: Lionhearted
>You wake up and groan
>FUCK this headache is worse than any hangover you’ve ever had
>And you’ve had some pretty gnarly hangovers
>You roll out of your bed and fall onto the floor
>FUCK
>You pick yourself up and rub your face
>You stagger to the shower and turn it on and relax in it for about 15 minutes
>Oddly enough the sonic vibrations help with your head
>Your Holophone goes off slightly after you step out and start to eat breakfast
>It’s Shaxx
>The one horned bull has fire in his eyes like you wouldn’t believe
>Even looking at a hologram of him you can tell he's gigantic
>"HAHA TITAN! YOU LOOK HORRIBLE!" he booms
>Does he have to yell through the phone?
>"Thanks Shaxx, I feel it too" you groan as you sit in your recliner
>"That tells me you used the Datachips I gave you, GOOD! I had a Shitty assignment for you if you hadn’t!" 
>Sneaky cunt
>"Yea I used them and they suck worse than any other Datachip I’ve used"
>"That’s how Combat and Physical fitness Datachips work! You'll still need to practice though!"
>You eat a forkful of eggs and nod
>"Ok, anything else I should know?" you ask before shoving another forkful of eggs into your mouth
>"Eats lots of protein! It’ll take the edge off the headache! I don’t know WHY it does!" he says with far too much enthusiasm
>>"Gotcha I’ll see you in a bit Shaxx, thanks"
>He nods and the hologram disappears
>You go to Grab a Dr.Pepper hoping for some caffeine only to find that you hadn’t restocked it since chase drank them all
>FUCK
>You put your suit and digiglove on and do one final check for things you might need
>Holophone... digiglove...earpiece
>Well that’s really all you need
>You head to your Bike and wave at your Owl neighbors
>They wave back this time though
>You jump on your bike and start it up
>Hopefully this day will be better than your morning

>Your bike roars through the FloCars like a shark through a school of fish
>You see a few of the faces of people as you pass
>Sitting talking to each other, laughing
>Holding hands, Kissing, hugging
>Your thought drift back to Rhiannon
>Why are you so hung up about it?
>She was an adult and so were you
>It wasn’t as if you were totally surprised about her choice
>Like you never really expected it to happen but you had hoped it would
>The bike revves up as you accelerate 
>You didn’t need to go fast
>You just enjoyed it
>You could turn the world into nothing but a blinding flash of colors and leave all your problems and thoughts behind you
>But they would catch up eventually, they always did

>You arrive at work and head into the staging room
>"Ah Titan, you look like shit man" Ronnie says looking you over
>"Yea I had some Datachips to use last night" you say sitting on a couch next to him
>"Ah that explains it" he says
>You look around the room
>Theo is on his Holophone talking to a female Jaguar you assume is his wife
>Eugene is trying to arm wrestle Shaxx, you can hear the servos in his arm whining from where you sat
>The cybernetic arm gives out and Shaxx slams it to the table causing the table to crack
>You see Drak wince slightly from the noise
>"SERIOUSLY? THAT’S THE 3RD TABLE THIS MONTH" he yells in his high pitched voice
>Ronnie laughs and Theo looks up from his phone and shakes his head
>"Seriously Eugene, stop challenging Shaxx to arm wrestling contests, you aren’t going to win" 
>Axel is having a barking/ laughing / coughing fit 
>"OH GOD...*cough* that... *cough*... never gets old" He laughs and coughs
>"Shut up Axel! I just got this thing upgraded" Eugene spits 
>"Are you sure it was an upgrade? Didn’t feel like it" Shaxx says as he flexes
>He looks over and sees you on the couch
>"Ahhh Titan, How’s the head feeling?" he says as he rummages through what you assume was his locker
>"Awful, I feel like Eugene’s arm that you just smashed" you say with a weak smile
>"HA! I LIKE THAT! HERE!" he Booms loudly causing your head to throb
>He gives you a shake of some sort and a meal bar
>"Those will help take the edge off!" he says slapping you on the back
>"Taken on a new Student Shaxx? How rare..." says Steven calmly as he walks in
>"I see great promise in Titan here" Shaxx says beaming at you
>"I see, so that’s why you requested Titan get an escort job tonight, Anyway assignments have been sent to your earpieces" 
>You hear Eugene whine "Man, I wanted to escort Valkyrie tonight"
>"You creep her out man" says Drak flying off to who knows where
>Your HUD shows that you are the one escorting Valkyrie, probably at her request as well
>You follow the route and knock at her dressing room door
>"Come on in!" you hear her cheerfully call through the door
>You enter and see her sitting at her makeup mirror
>"Hi Ms. North" you say with a weak smile
>"Oh, Titan you look awful...." she says standing up and walking to you
>Oh god she’s only wearing a bra and panties
>She puts her paws on either side of your face
>"Thanks Ms. North" you say as she rolls your face side to side to look at you
>"You can actually call me Valerie, Valkyrie is just a stage name, what happened? You lose a fight with a bottle of booze?" she cooes at you
>"Nah Shaxx gave me some boxing Datachips yesterday, this is the result" you say 
>"Mmm He's taking on a new student? He hasn’t done that in a long time, he must see something special in you" she says finally letting go of your face
>"What do you mean?" you say as you sit in an overly plush chair and she goes back to putting on make up
>"Shaxx used to be a coach for professional Boxing, his last student got caught Doping hardcore though, he hasn’t taken on a new student since" She says sadly
>"That kid broke his will to coach" she says before looking up at you
>"But he's taken you on!"
>You didn’t know all that... you thought he was just trying to teach you to fight
>She stands and gives a little twirl in front of you
>"How do I look Titan?" she asks as she stops to face you
>"You look great Valerie, what’s on the schedule?"
>"A photo shoot modelling a few dresses for a clothes company and a Few Swimsuits modeled for a private contractor, I want you in the room with me though" she says with a small twinkle in her eye
>You smile
>"Any reason why?" 
>"Well A. you're a handsome guy and I would love to tease you and distract you from that headache, and B. This guy has been known to get Handsy"
>"Fair enough, you don't mind if I eat and drink though do you?" 
>You show her the shake and the meal bar
>"Oh of course not! Hell half the time at shoots I'm eating and drinking" she slaps her plump tummy
>"That's why this hasn't gone away"
>You laugh
>"You still look great Valerie" you say sipping the shake
>It tastes like eggs and chocolate protein powder
>You're pretty sure that it IS eggs and protein powder
>Gross
>Still you drink it down as Valerie pulls on a tight red dress
>"Come on then Titan lets go" she says
>You stand and head to the door and open it for her
>"Such a gentleman" she says "That's why I like you"
>You smile and follow her through the door
>It’s a short walk as you follow behind Valerie
>"Come up here and walk with me mister" Valerie says over her shoulder to you
>"Aww dang I was enjoying the view" you say with a smirk
>She laughs 
>"I'm sure you were, but I promise I'm just as interesting from the front"
>You walk up next to her and she hooks her arm through yours
>"So Mr. Titan, tell me about you" she says looking up at you
>"Oh Uhmm, I’m from the ring, right there" you point out the window to the slums you grew up in
>"Aren’t those the Anthro district slums? How did you end up there?"
>You grimace
>"Touchy subject huh? I won’t push it. What do you do in your free time besides look at my videos of course?"
>You snort out a laugh
>"Mess with my bike, play video games, you know normal guy stuff" 
>She leads you through a door into a large room with photographic equipment set up
>"Ah Ms. North right on time and already wearing the first outfit" A...human says to her
>You grimace slightly and tense up
>She must’ve felt it because she pets your arm softly before breaking away from you
>"Ah and who's this?" the human looks up at you
>"This is my bodyguard, Titan, do try to stay on his good side won’t you?" she says to the photographer
>"Yea...yea I’ll do that" he says before scurrying off to his camera
>You find a seat near the back of the room where you can watch Valerie take different poses in the dress
>After about half an hour she changes into a White flowing dress 
>She seems to enjoy knowing that you’re watching her because she keeps shooting looks your way and smiling
>"Yes yes! Keep that smile! It’s perfect!" the photographer says snapping away 

>After a few dress changes (where she made sure you could see her) and a couple hours of photos she beckons you over
>"Well that’s over, enjoy the show?" she says with a smile
>"Yea I have to say I did" you say with a smile
>"What was that about by the way? As soon as you saw that guy you tensed up. Did you know him?" she says slightly concerned
>"Bad experiences with humans" you say with a small frown "Never really got along with them since I was raised by Anthros"
>She looks concerned
>"What on the ring has happened to you Titan?" She says wrapping her arm around yours once more
>"A lot, but most of it is a downer, don’t want to ruin the day do we?" you say with a small smile
>She looks up at you
>"So much sadness in those eyes of yours" she says 
>Her eyes are light blue
>Her fur light brown, her hair dirty blonde
>You snap your eyes away from hers
>"Where’s the next photoshoot?" you ask looking straight ahead
>You can tell she wants you to tell her more but relents
>"It's over here in the ball room, I think he has a fake beach set up" she says with a hint of sadness
>You didn't want to hurt her feelings but... somethings are best left buried in the past
>She leads you to a room, still locked around your arm
>There’s a full beach set up
>You approach with Valerie, keeping an eye and ear out as you approach
>There’s a small noise behind you causing you to break apart from Valerie to look at it
>A large Anthro bear is behind you with a camera
>He must have been hiding behind the door
>"This is a private Photo shoot HUMAN, you’re going to have to leave before I call security!" he barks in an unusually high voice for something so large
>"I AM Security" you growl
>You already didn’t like him
>"Titan is my bodyguard for this event given your...past with other models" Valerie says calmly
>"If he’s not here, neither am I"
>The Bear Looks concerned while looking you up and down
>"Just...just don’t get in my way..." he says with an Unintimidating growl
>You smirk
>This is the equivalent of an Anthro neckbeard
>Some rich boy Anthro who idolized an actress and got mommy and daddy to pay for a private photoshoot
>Whatever 
>Valerie ushers you into a small dressing room
>"He's groped other models before but his parents are huge high rollers here, so the higher ups keep bending the rules for him" she explains as she begins to undress
>You turn away as she changes
>"Oh come on now Titan don’t you wanna take a peek"
>NO BONER NO!
>You feel her arms wrap around you and her large breasts pressed against your back
>"Just a little one"
>BONER REACHING CRITICAL LEVELS
>ABORT
>"I do but that would be unprofessional given the situation right now" you say calmly 
>You look up at the ceiling and try to envision Shaxx in a ballet costume to contain your boner
>"Mhmmm you ARE different Titan... I like it" she purrs at you before letting go
>You stay focused on the ceiling as you hear rustling and a few snaps of elastic
>"There, all dressed. How I look?" 
>You turn around to find her in a small string bikini that has hearts over her nipples 
>They don’t hide her dark pink areolas at all though
> /endBrainfunction
>You’re speechless as she twirls in front of you 
>Of course you had seen her naked loads of times but it was different in person
>"Come on now say something!" she says smiling
>"You look great!" you finally choke out, snapping out of your daze
>She smiles at you 
>"Wait, why did you bring me in here to change anyway?" you ask, the thought just now hitting you
>"I want to make him jealous" she says with a smirk
>"He thinks you’re my personal bodyguard and probably more after I brought you in here with me" she says with a devilish grin
>Oh she’s good
>"Now then let’s go get this over with" 
>She leads you back into the room and you can see the bear huffing silently in anger
>You guess her little stunt worked because he's glaring at you
>You raise your eyebrows twice at him as you walk past and take a seat towards the edge of the room
>Valerie is listing of rules to him
>"1. No nudity unless paid for AHEAD of time, which you didn’t, 2. No touching PERIOD 3.no videos, only photos 4.if my bodyguard has to intervene he can use WHATEVER force he deems necessary" She lists
>The bear shoots you a worried look
>You crack your knuckles at him and smile
>He quickly looks away
>The shoot begins, various poses some very sultry and seductive, some...look like poses from animes
>Different costumes and swimsuits
>you’re reading an article on your Holophone about how to lessen headaches from datachip when you hear a muffled Yelp
>You look up to see the bear ON Valerie with his paw over her mouth
>GO TIME
>You bolt up and sprint full speed at them 
>A swift kick to his ribs sends him flying with a sickening crunch
>You continue after him though and Kick him again as he lands
>He’s a football to you as you kick until he's pinned to a wall
>He needs to suffer
>"Kick him again" says the voice in your head
>You kick and kick and..."Titan that’s enough"
>You feel paws around your arm
>Valerie is pulling you away from him
>You let her pull you away from the whimpering bear
>You let her lead you out of the room to her dressing room a few floors down
>The whole time she doesn’t let go of you
>When you finally get there she pulls you into a hug
>"That was..... Scary Titan" she says looking up at you
>Fuck
>You knew it your....tendencies would ruin this
>"But I’m glad you did what you DID! He’s been trying to do that since the beginning I think" she says pulling you closer
>What
>"Wait you aren’t mad at me? I thought you would be mad I went overboard" you say in disbelief
>"OVERBOARD? He tried to rape me! I should have let you kick his skull into mush" she says burying her face into your chest
>"Just....Thank you..."
>You’re taken aback
>You had expected her to be angry that you kicked his face in
>But here she was hugging you
>"Hang on I gotta send the clip to my boss" you say
>You click a button on your ear clip saving the video and sending it to Steven
>She’s still hugging you close
>You pet her head unsure of what else to do
>"People think that just because I did hardcore stuff years ago, i'll just bend over a take it for anyone now...” she says into your chest 
>You listen, best let her get it off her chest...
>"Humans.... Anthros... they all assume I’m just some easy lay... Even some of the security here!"
>You think back to Drak saying "you creep her out" to Eugene
>"I’m sorry for that...their loss for never learning how much of an interesting person you are anyway"
>She laughs and wipes her face
>"Thanks Titan, you're a good person... even if you have all that sadness in you" she says putting a paw to your face
>"Thanks Valerie" you say
>"I had better go report this, will you be ok? Do you want a ride home?" you ask 
>"No...No I’ll be fine thanks Titan, but I may take you up on that offer some other time" she says with a smile
>She hugs you again
>"I’ll see you later Titan, you really should be my personal bodyguard"
>"You have my Holophone number if you need anything don’t hesitate" you say before leaving
>"Thanks Titan" she says before closing her dressing room door behind you
>You arrive to the staging room to Steven going over the video you sent with some police men
>Fuck me sideways
>"As this video clearly shows, our security agent acted appropriately, and given the waiver the "victim" signed saying that security can act as they feel is reasonable there is no bases for any charges against my personnel" he says calmly
>"As well we have several recorded cases of him, sexually harassing out employees both in photoshoots and on the gambling floors"
>The video changed to the bear touching a waitress, then groping a dealer, the video changes to several different scenes of him slowly escalating each time
>"If anything the victim should be arrested for several cases of sexual harassment and attempted rape" Steven says to the officer
>They look at each other and nod before heading out
>"Sorry for the trouble, we'll file a report on this, can we get copies of the videos you showed us?" one says
>"But of course gentlemen, we always want to work WITH the authorities not against them" Steven says
>They leave and Steven turns to you
>"You very nearly could have killed that bear Titan, given your Augs, you aren’t in trouble because I understand it was heat of the moment, but try not to let it happen again" he says
>"Sorry sir" you say hanging your head low
>"That being said, is Ms. North ok? She’s a dear friend of my wife and I would hate to let her know I let her friend get injured" he says
>"She’s fine, a little shaken but fine" you say calmly
>"Sir I’m sor-"
>He raises a paw
>"Don’t say sorry for preventing a rape. If I was your size and saw that I would have reacted the same. I can’t stand rapists, but still try not to kill anyone...I’ll allow maiming of them though" he winks at you
>You smile
>"Yes sir"
>"Very well then, I’ll let you go home early granted only 30 minutes early but good job keeping Ms. North safe"
>You head out and mount up on your bike

>The ride home is...different somehow
>You see the Star of Alpha centuari rise over the edge of the ring
>The cool damp air doesn’t chill you but it revitalizes you
>You smile under your helmet
>Was this being happy? It had been so long
>Jail was sad and maddening
>When you go released you were relieved
>Rhiannon was...lust...you hoped
>Why feel it now?
>Was it because you did a good thing for someone?
>Was it... Valerie?
>You didn’t care right now

>You get home and turn in with the rising sun at your back
>Hopefully tomorrow was a good day was well

Chapter 13: Kamikaze
>You wake up feeling... refreshed for once
>There’s a hop to your step as you get ready
>You felt good, how could you not?
>Yesterday was a good day, prevented a rape, and got closer to a very interesting Bear...
>Plus you had a bunch of new knowledge swimming around in your brain
>You leave your apartment and look up at the ring as the Star sets on the artificial horizon
>How had you never noticed dusk was so gorgeous
>You jump on your Hoverbike and pat its side lovingly 
>Time to go

>As you ride you see the lights of the FloCars on the sides of the ring 
>The roads look like veins leading to the heart of the ring
>Ascension
>The City that terra had hoped would pull TerraKind out of years of bureaucratic mess
>A new government to shake things up
>If anything it got worse
>Greed, want, power
>It’s like we're a kamikaze pilot trying to march to our doom, led by endless red tape
>But none of that was your problem
>You’re just a man and you were born to hate
>And you did
>Humans, treating you like second class citizens unless you had money
>...Not you... Anthros...
>You pop a wheelie and speed towards the city
>Maybe this city did represent humans after all
>Deep in their hearts there might be only greed

>You pull into work and head to the staging room
>Everyone is somber? What’s wrong?
>"Hey Shaxx what’s up? Why is everyone so...down?"
>You feared it was about you kicking the bear yesterday
>You can hear Theo shouting from behind Stevens closed door 
>To get that calm guy riled up was... unheard of
>"Titan, Mr.Flinn has...requested you as a personal guard today as well as requested Ms. Edwards perform" Shaxx says calmly
>Fuck
>The boss...
>Any ideas you had of having a good night were instantly gone
>And in front of Jane
>Steven’s door is thrown open and Theo stomps over to a table and smashes it in half
>"WE DONT NEED HIS BUSINESS THEN, HE'S A RISK TO OUR MODELS AND TO OUR PERSONNEL STEVEN, YOURE LETTING HIM WALTZ IN HERE WITH A FULL ARSENAL AND PUTTING ONE OF MY SECURITY TEAM IN THERE WITH HIM!?!? Theo Roars Angrily
>Steven Keeps his cool amazingly
>"Theo, I'm as unhappy about this as you are. But this one is WAY above my head. There is literally nothing I can do besides either quitting and having Titan quit as well or straight up saying no and being fired. Mr.Flinn has friends in high places"
>"NO THIS IS-" 
>You put a hand on Theo’s shoulder
>"I’ll be fine, I know how to handle him" you say calmly
>Theo calms down a little
>"I know you do Titan, but we still have other guests to worry about, and given your past with him..." he says with a questioning look
>"I left that life behind, besides I’m more worried about Jane than anything" you say
>"Trust our Human Theo, He may have had a past but he is one of us now" Shaxx says in a steel cold voice
>"Fine but I’m calling in some more guys, I don’t like them having a full armory in there" Theo says
>"I already called them" Shaxx Says
>"Oh god you didn’t call that Quack did you?" Axel groans
>"I called EVERYONE" Booms Shaxx "WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS A VERY DANGEROUS PERSON AND HIS ENTIRE CREW, WHY WOULDNT I CALL THE DOC?"
>Axel Shrinks back
>"No one is starting any assignments until they all get here, we need all hands on deck for this" Steven says calmly

>You aren’t waiting long before a few Anthros walk into the Staging room
>A few look you over with interest
>A Deer Anthro walks over and looks you up and down a few times 
>She has a large slash down the left side of her face and an eyepatch covering the eye
>Must’ve been one hell of a fight 
>"This Titan? The Human? Doesn’t look all that impressive" she finally says with a frown
>"Why did you drag us all here anyway Shaxx" A Dingo a thick German accent says
>"Mia, Hunter we called you because Mr.Flinn is here and has brought his...armed friends"
>You stand up and Mia, the deer, shrinks back a bit
>"Fuck, you’re bigger when you stand up" She says looking up at you
>You Smile
>"Yes Mia this is Titan, He will be our eyes in Mr. Flinns party"
>You put out a hand only to have her look at it and frown
>"What am I supposed to be buddy buddy with you?"
>"I believe zat is called being polite Mia" the Dingo says before stepping forward and accepting your hand in his Cybernetic paw
>"I am Hunter, ze doctor for zis ragtag group" he says warmly
>You look at the paw as you’re shaking it
>Not built for strength...
>"Hunter here is more of a lover and not a fighter" Mia says rolling her eyes
>"I zimply vish to avoid a confrontation"
>"Yea well shooting fucking sleep darts out of your hand is weird" Mia Says
>"Sayz you, mz "crush a coconut with your thighs"" he retorts
>You look Mia over one more time
>He was right her thigh were large
>Unfortunately she caught you looking
>She sighs
>"Leg enhancement for running, I’m the one who catches the runners" she says gruffly
>"Nice" you say with a short nod
>Her ears flick softly
>"Where the Fuck is Lawrence?" Mia yells 
>"Behind you my dear" 
>A large Chameleon Anthro appears behind her causing her to swear and jump away
>"FOR FUCKS SAKE I HATE WHEN YOU DO THAT!" She yell before rushing at him
>But he’s already gone
>"Temper temper Mia" He says appearing besides you
>You've seen this before in your...previous work
>DNA and reflective enhancements specifically for Chameleons, mix a little octopus DNA and a little reflective nanites and voila you have near perfect invisibility 
>"I am Lawrence Swanson, you may call me Lawrence" he says with one eye on Mia and the other on you 
>"Uh....ok" you say
>There is a rumbling on the floor for a moment
>"Ah Alexandra is here" says Shaxx with a smile
>Oh boy
>After a moment a 8 foot tall Alligator Bursts into the staging room, wearing a red and white plaid shirt and torn up jeans
>Her scales have been completely covered in a NanoPlasteel armor 
>Thick THICK armor usually reserved for heavy Units in the military Special Forces on death worlds
>"Hey ya’ll! Where’s this Cutie human I've been hearing about!?" she says in a thick southern US Drawl
>"Uh Hi! I’m Titan" you say with a wave
>She’s on you in a flash
>"Well now ain’t you just the cutest!"
>She has you in a full on hug, your face pulled into her chest
>You look to Shaxx for help and he just Shrugs and laughs
>"OH Where are my Manners I'm Alexandra!" she says as she lets you go
>She then grasps you hand in both of hers and shakes up and down vigorously
>She finally releases you and you go to sit for the full briefing about what’s going down
>"Hey hey HEY! I’m here" 
>You stand in surprise
>A Small fox is sitting in the chair, she's maybe 3 feet tall max
>She’s also brushing her fur constantly
>"Oh uhh... sorry I didn’t see you there" you say
>"Yea I saw, you were too busy being smushed by Alexandra" She says with a high pitched laugh
>"Nelly By the way, Nelly Carro!" she squeaks happily extending a small paw
>"Titan" you say shaking it delicately
>You sit down next to her and wait for the briefing to begin
>"Alright... so against my wishes as Well as Theo’s, our higher ups have allowed Mr. Gabriel Flinn to reserve and use one of our Private lounges" Steven starts
>"He's also is bringing his entire entourage, all of whom we assume are armed"
>Mia Nearly spits out her coffee
>"ALL OF THEM!?!That’s enough firepower to-"
>"Yo rob this entire casino yes" Theo Says bleakly
>"That’s why you’re all here" Steven says
>"No earpieces on anyone besides Titan, Theo, Axel and Drak, we assume they already are in our security system" Steven says 
>"Naw but they're trying" Say Axel from a corner padding away at a computer
>"Have them on you but not equipped, if we do have an emergency we will need to be able to communicate"
>"Lawrence you're going to be patrolling the halls and entrances near the party room, Mia you're on the floor with Shaxx, Nelly you're going to patrol vents near the roof, we need to see if they trying to get extra equipment in" Steven lists
>"Alexandra you’re staying on the lower levels near the floor, everyone else you know what to do"
>You stand up reluctantly
>You had hoped this day would have been a good one
>And you dearly hoped this wasn’t what you thought it was

Chapter 14: Turbo killer
>Somberly you head to Jane's Dressing room
>You sigh at the door and knock
>"Come in!" Jane's voice calls through the door
>The door opens with a creak and you step into the room
>"Hey Anon! What’s wrong?"
>You look up at Jane and rub your face
>"Do you know who the private party you're dancing for tonight is?" you say with a frown
>"Uhh, some high roller, paid a lot ahead of time, why?" she asks walking up to you and looking into your eyes
>She has Dark Blue eyes that are as deep as the ocean
>"It’s...my former boss"
>"WHAT!?!" she says stepping back "DID YOU DO THIS?!?"
>"What? No! NO! I'm as unhappy about this as you! He apparently went right to the top requesting me AND you! We even brought extra security in"
>"How much security?" she asks with concern
>"Well they brought in an armored Gator Named Alexandra so a lot"
>She groans
>"Fuck if they brought in Alexandra we're in trouble"
>You nod
>You had seen this before, fuck you had been a part of this before
>But you hoped it was just a coincidence
>You rack your brain for birthdays or celebrations that may be around this time
>"Look Jane, if things get hairy I want you to get out of there do the stages have trap doors you can access easily?"
>She thinks for a moment
>"Yes... YES! For the "quick change" shows! There’s a button I can press with my footpaw" she says looking at you
>"If I tell you to I need you to go into that and not come out until either me or one of the other security people get you understand?" you say pulling her into a hug
>She’s quiet for a moment
>"If it’s not you that means..."
>"It means I'm busy" you say firmly
>"You catch that Axel?"
>You hear him cough
>"Yea Titan I got ya, good plan"
>"Smart Thinking Titan" you hear Theo's voice for the first time over the comms
>"Keep the innocents safe"
>You nod
>Wait... fuck, they can’t see a nod
>"Yes sir" you say calmly
>You sit silently as Jane dresses herself
>You take inventory in your head and steel yourself
>Armored suit: check...earpiece: check...Digigloves: Check... your fists: Check...
>Little voice in your head telling you to hurt people...
"Check" it whispers
>You always assumed you were born in the wrong time because of that little voice
>You would be right at home bashing someone’s face in with a war hammer
>But those were thoughts for another day
>It’s time to roll
>You silently stand and nod to Jane
>She looks…scared
>"It'll be ok" you say
>You walk with her hand in hand to the party room
>Top floor... easy to get stuff into if they have roof access via a FloTruck....
>"Ready?" you ask
>"No...But do I have a choice?" she asks sadly
>"Not really"
>You open the door and quietly guide her to her secondary dressing room here
>It’s filled with various outfits and bathing suits
>"I'll head out first...chances are it’s me they want anyway" you say calmly
>Jane grips your arm, you can feel her claws inadvertently dig into your suit
>"Please be safe Anon, I just want you to be OK"
>You smile
>"I'm always OK" you say
>You head out of the dressing room and onto the party floor
>You see... a lot of familiar faces
>You want to disappear, this isn't a good place to be and you know it
>"We've been waiting for you Titan" says a gravelly voice
>You turn slowly
>There he is...the boss
>A mid-fifties cougar with a cane to support his weight looks up at you
>"Hey boss" you say coolly
>"How ya been Titan? Gotten your fill of the good life yet?" he asks with a smile that could curdle milk
>"I don't know what you mean" you say, trying to remain calm
>"Oh I think you do, I saw that video of you punching that lizard out, and there you were smiling like it was your birthday" he says smiling up at you
>"You see you can lie to yourself but you can’t lie to me"
>You hear Jane get on stage behind you
>"You're the kinda guy I want because you enjoy the work Titan, all I ever had to do was tell you someone was selling drugs to kids and you...."
>He smiles cruelly
>"You wouldn't beat them into submission, you beat them into a coma"
>You're cracking your individual knuckles in anger at him but he continues
>"The second I heard about you I knew, a teenage human stomping a full grown man into nothing but a pile of mush? That’s a rare gift of me"
>"I'm not like that..." you say balling your fists
>He laughs in your face
>"Not like that! HA! The only reason I hired you is BECAUSE you were like that! We hacked every Camera when we sent you out because we enjoyed the show!" he laughs, sparking your anger further
>"You enjoy hurting people Titan we could see it as soon as we heard our dealers in the school where being beaten into dust by a human" he says with a wicked smile
>"A normal person will beat them up once and scare them off, you... you beat them, and beat them, and beat them, you could have a bat or a fancy gun at your disposal" he motions to your digiglove "and you would rather use your fists and boots"
>He laughs as a few of his men move through the room
>You make sure to look left and right at them
>Axel is watching
>"Ohh god Titan I remember hearing about you for the first time, a teenager, a human , hunting down a human pedophile, and literally stomping on him until he was nothing more than a puddle of blood and ground bone"
>"I knew you were what I needed and every single time we sent you out you had that same smile. The smile of someone who ENJOYS hurting people"
>You're aware they are circling you
>"So here's a choice Titan, join me again. HURT people, crush them again and show me that wickedly beautiful smile that you always did"
>He frowns
>"Or die here"
>Your heart sink with sadness
>You had always thought the boss liked you, that he had taken pity on a guy trying to fit in
>Instead you were a weapon and entertainment
>"Boss.... Gabriel, don’t do this, these are good people..."
>"Ha look who suddenly got a conscience!" he laughs
>You frown
>"I always have"
>"Where was it when you were beating every single person who ever did you wrong? Or when you let that human get your sister?" he growls
>You see Jane listening
>Fuck
>"Don't do this Gabe, please"
>"The whole reason I got you this job was to have you in here, they have what we want, and we can salvage the Augs from the security personnel"
>You see a flick of Gabe's tail and his men starting to move towards the door
>You look to Jane and flash her a panicked look
>"Well then Titan, what it gonna be? Join us again or die here wishing you were better"
>You shrug
>"Guess I’ll just die then"
>"That's a shame, good bye Titan" he motions to you and you can see his men moved
>Fuck
>"JANE GO!"
>You see her dive into the quick change trap door out of the corner of your eye
>You run
>Where can you go where there aren't goons?
>The balcony!
>As you run you hear orders being barked
>You dive behind cover as shots ricochet around you
>"Kill him! everyone else move out! The truck will be here and we need to get this done quick!"
>"THEO THEY'RE COMING!" you yell
>An alarm sounds,
>"ALL SECURITY PERSONNEL DON YOUR EARPIECES" You hear Axel's voice over the PA system
>"Theo they have a FloTruck coming, I’m going to try to get up to the roof"
>Your shotgun appears in your hands
>"What’s the range of the scattershot on this shotty Axel?
>"25 Meters give or take"
>Fuck yea
>"Titan! Your earpiece will turn into a helmet push the button on it three times"
>You do and a helmet forms around your head
>Neat, it has heat tracking
>You can see 3 guys in the room all pointing their guns at you
>"We can do this, let’s make them suffer" says that little voice
>You nod
>Go time
>You poke out and fire a blast at the closest one
>You go back behind cover before you see if they hit but your awarded with a scream and the smell of flash burning
>Plasma Vs flesh, Plasma wins
>The helmet shows he's down
>Kinetic rounds... your suit will stop kinetic rounds
>Fuck it
>Times up let’s do this!
>You Charge into the room channeling your inner Leeroy Jenkins
>Caught off guard, the two remaining thugs try to jump back but it’s too late
>You crack one in the face with the butt of your shotgun then fire off a blast of plasma into the others Chest
>He screams as he's reduced to a steaming puddle of green goo
>You grab the thug you cracked in the face by his throat and make your shotgun dematerialize
>"What’s in the FloTruck" you ask as you walk to the balcony
>"If I tell you they'll kill me!" the Anthro weasel chokes out
>"Bitch I'll kill you" you say shaking him
>"No I can’t! Anything you do to me Flinn'll do worse!"
>"Fine"
>You throw him off the balcony
>You hear him scream before the loud SPLAT
>Well if police aren't on the way they are now
>You go to where Jane is hiding and Knock on it
>"Jane its Titan open up"
>The trapdoor slides open and you're immediately wrapped in a furry hug
>"Oh god Anon I heard the gunshots and thought..."
>She breaks away and see the bodies of the goons
>"Did you?"
>You nod
>"Had to, either they kill me and hurt you, or I hurt them first"
>"Stay here Jane, stay hidden till this is all done, I'll be ok. But I need to know you're safe"
>You dematerialize your helmet
>"Please?"
>She hugs you again and surprises you with a kiss
>"Of course Anon, I'm glad to see you really left that life behind"
>The trapdoor closes
>Time to rip and tear
>"Axel how many are there? Axel?"
>Static
>You burst through the double doors to see Nelly sitting on a Thugs body
>"Titan! Comms are out!" she says
>"They have a FloTruck coming to the roof, it might have a jammer"
>"Let’s go then!
>She jumps onto your shoulder as you rematerialize you helmet and shotgun
>Thank god for enhanced stamina
>You’re tearing up the stairs, 1 floor to go
>You stop at the roof access door
>"Lift me to that vent above you let me see"
>Nelly is wearing a black suit, it must be a stealth one because she keeps shimmering in and out of partial invisibility
>You lift her and she tears the grate off and climbs in
>"One sec"
>You wait about a minute
>"Where's a truck here all right, and a jammer plus maybe 10 thugs"
>You shoulder your shotgun
>"I go loud, you go sneaky" you say
>"Yep" she disappears into the vent again
>You Kick open the door and fire a Blast of plasma
>One down
>You slide behind cover and bullets pepper the wall you're hiding behind
>Fuck it
>You run out, blasting volley after volley of plasma at them
>You can’t see her but you can tell Nelly is making short work of the goons as they focus on you
>In the end you took down 4 and she took down 6
>"What you got in that suit Nelly?" you say as you check the vitals on one of the guys Nelly got
>Still alive
FWOOM
>Your shotgun goes off
>You 5 and her 5
>She’s on your shoulder brushing her arm fur
>"I got internal Blades in my arms and those things that make me walk quiet" she says absentmindedly
>You have a small ninja fox on your shoulder... not weird at all
>Looking in the truck you see most of whatever was here is gone, there is however a grenade launcher when you quickly take and digitize
>"Look there's the Jammer!" Nelly Says pointing to a large electric beacon
>"I don't know how to turn it off though" She says
>"I do"
>You re-materialize the grenade launcher and fire off a grenade
>The grenade hits the Jammer and you don’t hear anything until the jammer collapses into itself with a loud "BWOOOOOWMM"
>"Implosion rounds! Nice" Nelly chirps
>"Theo, Axel, anyone what’s going on?" you ask into the earpiece
>"TITAN! Situation is hairy down here on the floor!" you hear Shaxx boom
>"Alexandra and I have all the Guests barricaded in a room"
>"Yea I could use a little back up" you hear Ronnie's voice as well as a few gunshots
>"Zis is quite fun" hunter adds "zis new formula is quite potent"
>Axel's cuts through on the comms
>"Titan Ronnie is pinned, he has about 7 or so guests and performers with him on the 30th floor"
>"On it, let’s go Nelly!"
>Run
>Breathe
>>Jane is Safe, Valerie isn't working tonight,
>You arrive at the elevators
>Jammed
>Stairs it is
>You blast down to the 30th floor and burst through looking
>"Where are you Ronnie?"
>"I'm at the performers Lounge!"
>Your HUD brings it up
>You run to it and after a short distance hear the gunshots and the occasional BWAP of a Laser rifle
>You turn a corner and see 5 or six goons behind a portable blast wall, three already dead from smoldering laser wounds
>"I wanna get me a pornstar" you hear a weasel guffaw
>You hadn’t stopped running so you drop your shoulder into the his head  and crush it against the barricade as Nelly jumps off your other shoulder and sinks her blades into the one next to him
>Spinning quickly, you grab the next closest thug and throw him into his friend knocking them out from behind the cover
>BWAP BWAP
>2 laser rifle shots, 2 headshots
>Nelly has already shredded the last ones neck
>"That you Titan?"
>"Yea you ok?" you say peeking out from the cover
>"Yea man, think you can drag that blast wall here though? I got civilians in here"
>"You got it"
>You grip the wall and drag it to the door
>"Nice shots by the way"
>He nods
>"I got this covered" he says "Go help the others"
>"Where next Axel?"
>"They're headed to the vault"
>You're running down the stairs
>"What do they want there?" Nelly asks "They have money"
>Steven answers
>"There are several dozen Experimental Augs and an experimental power frame in there, one of our Benefactors asked that it be kept here and a secret, however the info leaked it seems"
>A power frame! Oh god
>A power frame basically power armor on steroids, bigger bulkier and usually armed with implosion rounds and a laser Gatling built in
>"Who knew?" you ask as you run
>"Only myself and a few of the higher ups...."
>"Fuck, I’m hit..." you hear Mia's voice
>"Who can get to her?" you hear Steven ask
>"I got civilians here" you hear Eugene
>"Same, I'm in the kitchen with the staff" you hear Theo call out
>"We're on it" Nelly says from your shoulder
>"She’s on the main floor, fastest way is down those Stairs"
>"Nah, I know a faster way"
>You’re on the 5th floor, you see the balcony overlooking the main casino floor
>"Hold on Nelly!" you shout as you jump over the railing
>"OH MY FUCK THE MADMAN!" you hear Shaxx Shout.
>You land hard in a way that would make Deadpool proud
>Thank you enhanced bone density
>"Titan she’s on the other side of that row of Machines"
>The lights, the sounds, the noise of people having a good time here have been replaced with gunshots and screams
>There are several civilians that were caught in the crossfire you could see
>"The doc is with Shaxx and Alexandra, Mia has about four goons pinning her down" Axel Says calmly
>You follow the gunshots and your helmet highlights the thugs
>You wouldn’t be able to sneak up on them unless you went the long way around the main floor
>But Mia needed help now
>"Throw me!" Nelly says bouncing on your shoulder
>"I'll take care of them! Get Mia to safety!"
>You nod and she gets ready
>"Ready?" you ask
>"READY!"
>You fling her with all your might
>You look over to see a flash of fur slicing the goons up
>You run to Mia, there's a bullet hole through her left thigh and right shoulder
>"You ok?" you ask as you kneel next to her
>"Peachy, I love getting shot" she says sarcastically
>She’s ok
>You pick her up so her left arm as draped around your neck , your right arm cradling her back and you left under her knees
>"Watch the hands"
>Yea she’s totally ok
>The doc is with Shaxx
>"What room are you in Shaxx? I'm on my way with Mia"
>"We're in the employee lounge near the center stage"
>Other side of the building
>You take off running
>"TITAN WAIT THERES A-" Axel is cut off as you run into a group of thugs as you round a corner
>No time to stop
>You bowl through them
>You hear gunshots and swearing behind you
>Bullets whiz by you as you keep your body between Mia and Harm
>You feel what feels like a punch on your back
>Bulletproof suit still means you feel it
>You feel more and more rounds hitting you as you run
>"Shaxx, Alexandra! Titan is coming to you with 3 on his tail"
>"He doesn't have a tail" says Mia weakly
>"You know what I mean!"
>You see the door and as you approach it, Alexandra Bursts out of it and flies past you with speed that something that big shouldn't have
>You hear screams and crunching and really hoped she didn't just eat them
>You come to a stop in front of Hunter and set down Mia
>"I vill take care of her"
>Shaxx has a Laser Gatling and full orange and white armor
>"Shall we get this rabble out of our Casino Titan?
>You nod and kneel next to Mia
>You put out a hand
>This time she shakes it, albeit weakly
>"Ok we can get buddy buddy now" she says with a faint smile
>"Let’s go"
 
>Shaxx leads you through the back hallways at breakneck speed
>He sure can move fast even with all that armor
>You can hear a plasma cutter slicing through the vault door
>"We need to take out that Cutter" Shaxx says
>You materialize your Grenade launcher
>"Ooo I can’t wait to see what you do with that!"
>You take aim and fire a grenade that hits the plasma tank of the cutter
>The result an implosion that then explodes molten plasma everywhere
>"Nice" you say as you pet the gun lightly
>"Very nice" Shaxx says
>You both run down the hall and look at the carnage
>There are bits of Anthros splattered everywhere and some steaming piles of goo
>You turn and see him
>The boss
>He's on this back, his side and legs badly burned
>You dematerialize your grenade launcher and materialize your pistol
>You walk to him
>"Now...now Titan... let’s talk about this like"
BLAM BLAM
>The twin burst pistol fires off two shots that ricochet off the ground next to him
>"You were like a father to me, and all I was to you was a weapon?"
>You stomp on one of his Burned legs, cracking the bones and earning a scream
>"I looked up to you! I would have done anything for you because you were the only one that looked after me!"
>"And then you throw me aside for what? Some Augs and a power frame?"
>You level the pistol at his face
>"Do it" whispers the voice
>But this time... you lower the pistol
>He'll suffer more in prison, there was no way he could get out of this attack
>But he's still awake, and a threat
>You kick the side of his head sharply and he's out cold
>"Well done Titan, let’s go meet the authorities and get this all sorted out"
>You dematerialize your gun and helmet
>"Yea. Let’s go"

You start up your bike and are about to speed off when you feel a paw on your sleeve
>You look to see Jane holding your sleeve gently
>"Ca-can I come with you Anon? Today really shook me up and you almost died..."
>You don’t answer, instead handing her a helmet clip and patting the back of your bike
>Dhe mounts up behind you and hugs you close
>At least you want to think it’s a hug and not her holding on

>The sun has already risen and lays streaming sunbeams through your helmet visor
>You quietly ride and think about Jane and everyone
>You’re happy your friends, old and new, were safe
>You ride and feel the sunlight on your face 
>A whole day spent killing people from your past
>The boss...treating you like nothing 
>You were so tired 
>So tired the little voice isn’t even talking
>The FloCars part like the red sea as you ride
>You think about Jane, Mia, Nelly and your friends
>You all nearly died today
>But...During it all you weren’t scared, just.....determined
>You needed to keep everyone safe, protect Jane
>There was no room for fear
>You pull into your apartment parking spot and head in

>You look at your Holophone
>Messages galore
>You call them back one by one
>Valerie first
>The Holophone rings once before it’s snapped up, a small hologram of her appears 
>"TITAN THANK GOD ARE YOU ALRIGHT?" she almost sobs into the phone
>She’s wearing a t-shirt that’s stretched thin against her bosom and only underwear
>"I’m fine I’m fine, I didn’t pick up because I was... Busy, I’m sure you’ve seen the news"
>"I saw bits and pieces, are you ok?" she says breathlessly
>"Breathe Valerie, I’m fine, just sore from the day"
>You see Jane strip and climb into your bed, yawning loudly and showing off her impressive teeth
>"Thank goodness, I feared the worst when you didn’t pick up" she says calming down a little
>"Are you ok? Need I to come over to your place and take care of you for a bit? I make killer clam chowder" she says with a small smile
>"I May take you up on that offer later but right now I’m just letting people know I’m ok before bed" you say, running your fingers through your hair
>"Ok Titan, I’m glad you're safe, sleep well" she blows you a kiss before the holomessage closes
>Who’s next? 
>Isabelle has left over a dozen messages and phone calls
>You dial her up
>"OMGANONAREYOUOK"
>Her hologram looks like it’s trying to strangle the phone for answers
>She’s wearing that pink pajama onesie again 
>"I’m fine, I’m fine"
>"Are you sure? I saw the news, the mafia you rolled with attacked the UltraLux!" 
>"I know I was there" you answer with a faint smile
>"Not funny! You could have been killed!" she scolds you
>You look over and see Jane is already asleep in your bed
>"Yea but I took care of it, I think the gang isn’t going to be doing anything for a while"
>She looks confused
"Did...did you have to... you know..."
>"Kill people? Yes Isabelle, but we were able to hand the boss over to the authorities alive"
>You can see her thinking about what you just said
>"I.... I’m not sure how I should feel about this, I mean you did your job and kept people safe but you had to ....kill people"
>"It was either them or me Isabelle. Anyway I’m heading off to sleep, long day you know" you say with a short sigh
>"Alright Anon sleep well" say says before
>You look through, there’s a message from chase even, but...none from Rhiannon
>Maybe she hasn’t seen what happened, you don’t take her for a news kinda girl
>You dial up Chase who sleepily answers
>"You dead yet?"
>"No"
>"Aight cool cya"
>He hangs up
>That fucking guy
>Stripping down to your underwear you yawn and look over to your bed
>Jane is snoring loudly
>Well snore purring
>her breathing in is a loud SNNNRRRRR and out is a soft Prrrrrrrrrrrr
>You climb into bed and pull her to you with one arm and nuzzle her neck softly before falling asleep yourself

>You awake to the smell of bacon and coffee
>Standing up causes various creaks and pops from your sore body
>Stretching causes even more
>You pull on some shorts and follow the smell
>Jane is in your kitchen cooking bacon on the stove and has a fresh pot of coffee for you
>"Where did you get coffee?" you say pouring a cup of it
>"I got the Biodispenser to make ground coffee beans and used hot water and a strainer!” Jane says happily
>"Did you get in contact with your folks? And your friends about yesterday?" you say sipping your glorious wakeup call
>"Yea I did, Chika said she finally got Ronnie to stay with her at her place after it all"
>Nice, you think to yourself
>You sit in your recliner and pull up various news and Human+Anthros threads
>The news has the failed robbery attempt plastered all over it, with various clips from the internal security cameras
>Ha there’s one of you jumping from the balcony with Nelly on your shoulder
>You click a few others
>Mia running and delivering a kick to the face of a stout Anthro
>Shaxx going full on HAM and opening fire with that Laser Gatling of his
>Theo tearing through a group of thugs, running on all fours
>Alexandra tearing past you and disposing of those 3 thugs that were chasing you
>HA there’s even Drak dropping the brick on one!
>You save the clip of your jump and post it to the human+anthro thread saying that it was you
>Jane walks over and sees the various clips pulled up
>"Some night huh?" she says setting down a plate of eggs and Bacon
>"Thanks babe, and yea it definitely was an interesting night, how long did I leave you in that trap door? 4 hours?" 
>"3 Hours, I spent most of it on my Holophone calling people to tell them I was safe" she says sitting on your lap
>The thread has exploded at this point from you posting that Clip
>"dickpicplz" "Danger Floof" "prove it" "KYS" were some of the replies
>Jane laughs at them
>"Wanna add fuel to that fire?" she asks with a smirk
>"What did you have in mind?" 
>She takes off her shirt revealing a lacy black bra and her glorious DD tits then walks over and grabs your earpiece
>"put on the helmet!" she says tossing it to you before she grabs her Holophone
>You put on the helmet and she sits herself back down into your lap
>She then poses with 2 paw pads up in a "peace" kinda way and takes a picture of her in your lap
>you look at the photo
>Her in her bra striking a peace pose with you looming over her with your helmet on
>She posts the picture to the thread with the comment "me with Janet Diamond" in a direct response to the clip
>You take a bite of eggs and sit with her as she scrolls through various threads and news site
>"Gabriel is going to get a lot of time for that" you say as you finish your food
>"Yea, they are putting every death onto his charges"
>She goes back to the human+anthro thread
>From the responses, you think half the thread is having an autistic fit
>"Slam Jam Her Clam!" "FUCK HER RIGHT IN DA PUSSY"  "Lucky bastard!"
>You smile and she leans into you
>"Good to be here with you again Anon"
>"Good to have you here"
>She browses your game collection on your computer
>"You have NO new games?!" she says with mock anger
>"Jail" you say with a shrug
>"We'll have to fix that!"
>She grabs a helmet clip and goes to your door
>"I’m borrowing your bike! Be right back" say says before disappearing
>You wonder if it’s still keyed to her paw pads to start
>The roar you hear from it tells you it is
>Your Phone goes off
>Its Shaxx
>"HAHA TITAN! Since we have some time off I expect you at the gym everyday starting tomorrow! Let’s get you trained! In the meantime enjoy your day off!" he says with so much bravado
>"Slso I ordered you a punching bag for your apartment! Think of it as a gift you getting the high score yesterday!"
>You laugh
>"Thanks Shaxx, I'll treat it like one of those thugs"
>"That’s what I like to hear! See you tomorrow!"
>His hologram disappears as he hangs up
>You decide to check in on Ronnie 
>The maned wolfs hologram appears
>"What up Titan" he yawns
>"I heard from a reliable source you got yourself a squirrel"
>He grins sheepishly and he turns his phone to Chika still in bed
>"Nice! How you feeling? I’m sore allover"
>"I pushed my Augs too far yesterday, I need to see my specialist" he says with a sigh
>"Good luck with that, see ya later man"
>He nods and then hangs up
>You slide Mia's datachip into your phone next
>Might as well right?
>The Holophone rings a few time before a hologram of her in a sport bra appears
>"Who is thi- oh if it isn’t my savior" she says smiling
>"Hey Mia, how you feeling?"
>"The doc fixed me up pretty good, my arm is a bit sore but I was actually jogging when you called"
>Bullet wound straight to jogging this girl is crazy
>"Ha good to hear, just thought I would check in on you"
>"I’m not a kid! I can take care of myself! But thanks...see you around"
>She hangs up and you continue browsing the threads and news sources
>After a bit you hear your bike roaring in and stopping then Jane coming into your apartment
>"I brought "Souls borne: Night of the hunt" and "Dawn of Destiny" for us to play!" she says happily
>You smile at her and she sits back into your lap and nuzzles up to you
>You spend the day playing games with Jane and relaxing

Chapter 16: falling
>It turns out the UltraLux was closed for 2 weeks because of the attempted robbery
>There were of course quite a few angry customers  regarding the safety of guests there and that the mafia was basically given a free pass to bring what weaponry they wanted
>The executive who allowed it was almost to the point of being publicly lynched, both figuratively and literally
>And victims and families of the victims wanted him tried for the murders as well
>But that was all above your pay grade
>You had trained every day with Shaxx for about 4 hours a day for the last 9 days
>Every other day he gave you new Datachips with more and more advanced skills, which lead to worse and worse headaches
>He said he was impressed with how fast you picked up on it all
>Right now though you're at home sitting with Jane
>You had used some of your money to buy another recliner and another screen for your computer
>She said she still preferred your lap to the recliner but was happy none the less
>Jane was in her chair wearing a blue t-shirt and yellow short shorts
>You were playing a 2 player co-op game called "Rise of Terra" where it was basically a shoot em up against aliens who wanted to take over Terra or something
>She was much better at it than you though
>"Come on this way slowpoke! There are some good guns over here" she directed 
>"How many times have you played this through Jane?"
>Her ears go flat
>"Uhh" she starts counting on her paws
>"Eight I think, I wanted all the trophies!"
>She would
>Beneath all that sexiness and beauty was still the nerd you dated back in high school
>And were dating currently
>The attempted robbery kind of solidified things back between you too again
>Even in school people said you were the perfect match
>"The beauty and the beast" they called you teasingly
>But you didn’t care what they said, because you knew they didn’t understand
>"HEY FOCUS!"
>"Fuck sorry" you say as you snap back to the game 
>An aliens head explodes in front of your character
>"You would pick a tank class character"
>She had chosen the zippy fast character class
>"Yea well I want to hit hard and take hits" you say as your character punches an alien war beast to death
>"I would rather not get hit at all" 
>Her character somersaults away from a giant monster alien and shoots at it
>You both play for a while before your Holophone goes off
>"Fuck sorry pause"
>You stand and dig in your pockets for your Holophone while Jane complains about losing her groove
>Isabelle's hologram pops up after you finally get your phone out
>"Hey Anon mind if I come by for my weekly check in?" she asks happily
>"Uh....yea sure...." 
>You were hesitant about having her meet Jane
>Wait why do you care? 
>"Ok! I’ll be by in a bit"
>She waves and hangs up causing her hologram to disappear
>"Who was that Anon?" Jane says peeking under your arm
>She must’ve stood up and snuck up behind you
>"My parole officer, she’s coming by in a bit for a check in"
>"She had some jammin tits" Jane says smiling 
>"JANE! FOR SHAME" you say in mock anger
>"Whhhaaaaatttt. I've done softcore for a reason!"
>You reach over and hug her
>"And that reason being?"
>She looks up at you and kisses you softly
>"Well first off, I like both guys and gals"
>You nod, "I know that"
>She bites her lip softly
>"And...No other guy really competed with you"
>You stare at her
>"What do you mean?"
>She pulls you in close
>"Every other guy I tried to date just wasn’t sweet like you, and every other guys... you know... either hurt me or just... werent enough. So I stuck to softcore and hoped you would come back to me with some sense in that thick head of yours"
>She called you sweet dawwww
>You hug her and give her a soft kiss
>"And nothing compares to you" you say with a smile
>She bats your face with her tail
>It tickles 
>You pet her tail gently getting a happy purr from her
>You knew feral tigers couldn’t purr and you have no idea why she could but you weren’t going to question it
>She breaks from your hug
>"Enough mushy stuff! GAME!" she demands throwing you your controller
>You sit down and she scooches into your lap
>You can feel her purrs in your chest
>"My favorite chair" she says looking up at you
>You kiss her and rub her sides
>"My favorite person to have sit on me"
>She looks into your eyes with her deep blue eyes
>She kisses you deeply, her tongue pressing into your mouth and yours into hers
>Your hands slip under her shirt and she grinds her glorious ass into your ever growing erection
>She breaks from your kiss and breathes heavily
>"Mmmm I missed this" she purrs
>"I missed you" you say as you feel her bra and quickly squeeze her breasts
>Your hand slides down her tummy and pushes under her panties
>"Mmmm keep going Anon"
>You’re about to push a finger into her when
KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK
>FUCK 
>Isabelle the parole officer, more like Isabelle the cock block
>You sigh and flex your legs a few time to get blood away from your erection
>"Mmmm nice" she says as she feels your muscles tense under her
>She slides into her chair
>"Open" you say
>The door slides open and Isabelle strolls in
>"Hey Anon! How’s your week going? I heard you have it off because of the whole robbery thing"
>You stand up and head to your kitchen
>"I’ve been training in boxing and stuff, and been hanging out with Jane"
>Isabelle has walked into your bedroom
>"Still have that picture I see"
>You still have the picture Valerie gave you on display
>She walks out and finally sees Jane
>She freezes and stares for a moment
>"Uhh hi I’m Jane, I’m Anon's Girlfriend"
>Isabelle isn’t looking at Jane though
>She’s looking at the screen
>"IS THAT RISE OF TERRA?" She squees before taking your spot
>"Yea! Wanna play?! Anon it terrible at it"
>"Hey no I’m not!" you defend your video game pride
>"Yea you are"
>Isabelle has already taken your controller and has unpaused the game
>Great, now they are both ignoring you
>You sigh and decide to make some food for them
>"Hey anyone want nachos?"
>"And beer!" Jane calls
>"Bring me one too!" Isabelle chimes
>"Yes ma'ams"
>You set about preparing nachos from the Biodispenser
>Extra cheese and no beans for Jane
>You grab a few beers out of the fridge and bring the steaming plate of nachos to them 
>"Thanks babe" Jane says sneaking you a quick kiss
>You crack open the beers and hand one each to them
>They continue to play and you start practicing on your punching bag in your bedroom

>After about an hour you come back into your main room to see Isabelle showing a ton of Anime shows to Jane
>Jane looks a bit confused about all of them
>"What does this show have to do with Rise of Terra" Jane asks with a perplexed look on her face
>"It has giant robots fighting aliens!" Isabelle says with her eyes gleaming
>Jane never really watched anime to the best of your knowledge
>"Uhh... I don’t know about all this but...ill check it out" Jane says hesitantly
>Isabelle is practically oozing social awkwardness as she clicks through random shows
>"This one is my favorite! It’s about a Magical girl fighting the forces of darkness!" 
>You notice the main character (or at least what you assume is the main character) has Bright pink hair and pink eyes
>"I KNEW you got that gene resequencing done for those anime shows!"
>Isabelle's ears go flat and she turns to look at you
>"Uhmm...Yea I did...”
>You laugh 
>"Whatever you do you! If you like it who cares"
>Jane Smiles at you and mouths "good save" Behind Isabelle
>Isabelle looks at her Holophone and jumps a bit
>"Fuck is that the time!? Goddamit I have to meet another Parolee!" she says scrambling out of your chair and to the door
>"Bye Anon! Bye Jane! It was nice to meet you! I’ll see you later"
>She opens the door and rushes out
>"Well that was... Interesting" Jane says blinking in confusion
>"Yea she’s new-ish to the ring and doesn’t have many friends... or uhh... any besides me, and you now I guess" you say with a short laugh
>"I never took you for an Anime fan babe"
>You sit back down next to her and swap the monitor back to the video game
"I'm not! She asked if I had seen this show while we were playing and then she went on this whole tangent of Animes" Jane sighs 
>You look at your Character loadout
>"Dammit she fucked up my loadout! Why would a tank use a sniper rifle?"
>"You could take some pointers from her" Jane says smugly
>"Yea yea yea, I'm out of game practice, let me get back into it"
>Right as you’re about to start playing again your Holophone goes off
>It’s Shaxx
>"Hey Shaxx, what’s up?" you ask as the hologram of the bull appears
>"Titan, you've progressed well in training! So well I signed you up for a Boxing match the day after tomorrow!" Shaxx says with an eager smile
>"How well has he been doing Shaxx?" Jane asks as she leans into your phone
>"Ah Hello Ms. Edwards, Titan here is probably the most gifted Pupil I've had"
>"Ooo really?" Jane says looking at you
>You shrug
>"Titan I have full confidence in your ability! Relax tomorrow, maybe take Ms. Edwards on a date! You too would make a cute couple" he laughs
>"We are a couple Shaxx" Jane says with a coy smile
>"YOU LUCKY DOG" Shaxx booms so loud you swear your apartment shakes
>You smile
>"Ms. Edwards as well if you could convince Titan to stop smoking it would be appreciated! He would do much better without!"
>She looks at you scrutinizing
>"Fine fine, I’ll work on it"
>"Very good! Have a good evening you two" Shaxx says before his Hologram disappears
>"Do you think you're ready for a legit match?" Jane asks nuzzling into you
>You think about sparring with Shaxx and how hard he hits
>"I think after being hit by Shaxx I can take anything, dude hits like a FloTruck"
>Jane is back in your lap 
>"Well if you do good during the match I’ll have a special treat for you, how’s that for extra incentive?" she says looking up and you seductively
>She starts grinding into you again
>"Ooo that’s good incentive" you say hugging her
>Your hands are on her body like a blind mans on a wall
>Her generous sides, her rippling muscle under a slight bit of chub, her long gold colored striped tail
>She purrs and nuzzles into your neck
>"No sexy time until you win your match though" she teases
>"Aww dammit"
>"I didn’t say anything about blowjobs though"
>You smile at her
>"No you didn’t"
>Tonight’s gonna be a good night

Chapter 17: how's it feel?
>It’s the day of your first boxing match
>You're in a room waiting to be called out
>Jane is sitting with you rubbing your shoulders
>"You're going to do great out there babe," she purrs
>You were confident but still it’s your first match like this ever, so of course you were nervous
>"I have the utmost confidence in you Titan! I've seen what you can do both boxing and in a gunfight!" Shaxx says
>He’s leaning against a wall with his arms crossed
>Giving you space, you assumed
>You steel yourself and breathe in deep
>'Relax, you got this,' you think to yourself
>Jane has moved behind you and is massaging your shoulders
>"Time to glove up Titan"
>Shaxx has a pair of boxing gloves and puts them on you and laces them up tight
>"Relax Babe"
>You wrap an arm around Jane
>She kisses you softly and whispers "for good luck"
>You leave the room and head to the ring
>A human is there with his coach, just outside the ring
>You frown and turn to Shaxx
>"Shaxx, you didn't say I would be boxing with a human"
>He actually looks surprised that you said that
>"What did you expect Titan? A bull? A bear? The regulations say humans Vs humans at this level"
>You sigh and step into the ring
>The ref beckons you over and the human as well
>You bump gloves with him and frown
>'Back to your corner...'
>'Focus'
>'Don't let it bother you.'
>You repeated this mantra over and over
>It's just some guy
>You turn and face the center and a bell rings
>Fists up, the both of you shuffle to the center
>"Let’s see what you got little girl," the human sneers
 
>You're walking home from school
>"Brother! Wait up! You're walking too fast"
>You turn around to see your sister Maggie; a small Cocker spaniel Anthro chasing you down
>"Hey little girl, how was school?"
>She looks up at you with a small frown on her muzzle
>"Tommy kept picking on me and saying I was a no good orphan"
>You clench your fists
>"Ill fix that for you little girl," you say before hugging her
>"Thanks Anon, you always protect me"
 
>A fist slams into your face
>And another
>And another
>You're in the ring and the guy is pummeling you
>You're frozen
>Maggie's face is plastered to your mind
>"You always protect me," her words were ceaseless echoes
>Another fist to your face
>Then your ribs
>You hear Shaxx shouting at you, but you can’t make it out
>All you can hear is her voice
>A male voice cuts through
>"That all you got Cuck?"
>It snaps you back to the pummeling you are receiving
>You manage a glimpse up at your assailant
>A face
>His face?
>HIS FACE
>Your heart pumps lava as your anger shatters through the pain
>How dare he think he could ever see the light of day again after what he did to you?
>DID TO HER
>You punch hard and score a direct hit into his jaw
>Your Muscles and Augs scream in protest as you unleash a series of punches to his face
>He wasn't even ready to block since you were just taking his punches before
>And he was paying for it now
>Your technique, your practice, your discipline have all gone out the window
>Days of training and hours of pain, all lost to the void
>It's replaced by the undying fury of a thousand suns worth of rage
>You fire off an uppercut to his chin
>All of your anger, pain and sadness are poured into it
>your Augs burn white hot in your muscles as your fist makes contact , steam pouring from every vent in your shoulders and thighs
>His skull snaps upwards and his body flies vertical at least 4 feet before crumpling into a heap in his corner
>You continue your charge
>"CHASE HIM GET HIM FUCK HIM UP!" the voice in your head screams
>You rush in towards his motionless body
>"MAKE HIM PAY MAKE HIM SUFFER!"
>The ref is in front of you pushing you back before you can get to him, whistling in distress as he tries to ward you off
>You've won the match but your body and mind demand more
>He needs more pain
>More suffering
>Shaxx is on you pulling you away as you try to crush your opponent into dust
>He has physically lifted you and carried you to the locker room as you struggle in vain to escape his mighty grasp
>When he finally lets you do you scream in anger and punch the nearest locker
>Then do it again
>And again
>And again
>Its nothing more than a crumpled heap of metal when you’re done
>Your legs give out and you fall to your knees
>Why is your vision blurry?
>Tears? Why are there tears?
>The faint feeling of fur suddenly surrounds you
>Its Jane, her body doing its best to cover you
>"It’s ok Titan, Its ok," she keeps repeating
>You try to rub your face
>FUCKING BOXING GLOVES
>"Get this shit off me," you yell flailing your arms in anger
>Only the thought of Jane there, still holding on slows you down
>Shaxx unlaces the gloves
>When your hands are finally free, you break
>They find themselves over your face, the dark and wet feeling being your only clue
>But a new one joins the sensations
>Jane is rubbing your back
>"What was that Titan?" you hear Shaxx over your shoulder
>"NOTHING, FUCK OFF," you yell in anger
>You feel 2 mighty hands grab your shoulders and force you up
>"NOTHING? NOTHING?!? I'VE SEEN YOU KILL PEOPLE WITH NO PROBLEM AND YOU FREEZE IN A SIMPLE BOXING MATCH?!?!" he roars
>You scowl and struggle in vain within his grip
>"TELL ME."
>You push your Augs to the limit, feeling them burn, Steam pouring out of your vents
>It was enough to finally break out of his grasp
>Your fists balled, your Augs and muscles screaming, your head full of anger and sadness
>But through it all, Jane is in front of you
>She’s holding you and you break down in tears once more
>"Anon...What happened...tell me love," she cooes quietly
>"I....I saw Maggie," you sob into her shoulder
>"Your sister? She died Anon, She died when you were 15"
>No...
>That’s not how it went
>You pull away from Jane
>"Tell me Anon"
>"Tell us" says Shaxx, his voice no longer in anger but in concern
>You look at Jane
>She’s gorgeous, even with a face of sadness
>"Promise you won’t hate me?"
>She hugs you
>"I could never hate you Anon"
>You breathe in and wipe your face
>"Where do I start?"
>"At the beginning," Shaxx says sitting down
>So you start from the beginning
 
>You were raised in an Anthro orphanage, dropped by your parents or some passerby who found you
>You were the only human, teased playfully by the other orphans
>Picked on relentlessly for being the only human in a full Anthro school
>You took it all despite your friends telling you to stand up to them
>One day when you were 7, you stumbled on a puppy Anthro Cocker spaniel
>She was only about a week old...
>Maggie
>The closest thing you had to family
>The other orphans were close to you, but not like this
>A true bond formed from the moment you opened the basket she was in as a newborn pup
>She followed you everywhere and was everything you knew you weren't
>Smart, charitable, happy go lucky,
 
>"She was my best friend," you sob to Jane, your face buried in your hands
>"What happened Anon"
>"He happened"
 
>While you were in high school another human appeared
>Not because he was a student but because he was hanging around the Anthro slums
>And of course you gravitated towards him
>He was the only other human you knew
>Derek
>Some wannabe country-boy with a fake hick accent
>Spending daddy's money on cans of dip and his stupid ass FloTruck
>But he was the only human you knew!
>So you hung out with him even though you hated his fake accent and the fact he spit fucking everywhere
>He learned about you and the fellow orphans through you
>He was your human friend, the only one you had
>But one day you were waiting for Maggie to meet you at your usual spot near her elementary school
>You waited and waited and waited
>But she never came
 
>"I asked her friends if they had seen her, but they all said no," you sob into Jane's shoulder
>"I went to the school asking where she was"
>"No one had seen her; not since I went into my high school and left her to walk the 500 meters or so to her school"
 
>You had found her
>Her body
>A poor mangled little body of a little girl who deserved life more than you did
>You had picked her up and cried into her cheek apologizing to her
>Those apologies would go unheard
>When the police finally came around they treated you like suspect number 1
>"We found human semen in her and you're the only human around here!" they shouted at you
>But DNA tests proved otherwise
>It was human, but not you
>But you knew who
 
>"I grabbed a pipe out of an alley, put it in my back pack and hopped on the bus to his house"
 
>It was a fancy pool house on his father’s land
>Bigger than the dormitory you slept in your entire life
>He made and sold drugs from there
>You had snuck into it, found him looking at pictures
>Pictures he had taken
>Of her
>Her nude body tied up and struggling
>Her crying with a gag in her mouth
>Her dead body thrown in a ditch
>You smashed the pipe into his head
>He lay on the floor, a broken heap of a man, whimpering and calling for help
>You stomped
>And there was silence
>Not a whisper or a word
>Looking down at him, something came to fill the void
>You remember the voice for the first time then
>"Keep going," it urged, "keep stomping on him, he deserves it"
>So you did
>You stomped on his head until nothing but a puddle of teeth and mush and shattered skull lay on the ground before you
 
>"And then I left and called the police. They never could tie it back to me but...rumors started"
>Jane has her paws to her mouth
>Shaxx looks solemn, leaned up against a locker with his arms crossed
>"I used to call her little girl"
>You hesitate
>"I used to call Maggie 'my little girl,' and when that boxer called me that...I just..."
>Jane has her arms around you
>You break down again
>"All I could do was think how I failed to protect her"
>"What made you go into a frenzy then," says Shaxx
>"I ...I just saw his face, Derek's stupid face looking at me, and I wanted to break it"
>"And you did, If he hadn't had a mouth guard in that uppercut would have shattered all of his teeth" Shaxx says with a small smile
>Jane is hugging you close
>"I had no idea Anon"
>she has tears in her eyes
>"I knew that you were close to Maggie but...that"
>You bury your face into Jane's neck fur
>a solid hand comes down on your shoulder
>Shaxx is there looking down at you
>"Guess you're going to turn me into the police now Shaxx"
>He actually laughs at that
>"Turn you in? What kind of monster do you think I am? How could I turn in a Man who killed a pedophile?"
>he spits
>"To me they are lower than that spit"
>you actually manage a smile
>Jane is still hugging you close
>you breathe in deep
>There's a faint smell of Dust and musk in the locker room you're in
>"What now?" you ask finally calming down
>you feel something you hadn't before, something deep within you
>like a burden has been lifted
>how could it not
>others had guessed you killed Derek
>even the boss had only guessed
>this was the first time you had told anyone
>"I'm going to ask you to do something difficult" Shaxx says, his hand on your shoulder
>"What's that"
>"stay angry at Derek, focus on it in the ring, see every opponent as him and crush them"
>Jane looks both surprised and angry
"Shaxx that's not right! That's not healthy!"
>Shaxx shakes his head at her
>"It is healthy Ms. Edwards. You see, to feel angry and dwell on it is unhealthy; but to turn Anger into something productive to use it as fuel to propel you forwards; that is both beautiful and the best revenge"
>"Titan could keep it all in, hide it away like he has for years, but for him to get to in his mind constantly beat the man who ripped away what was most precious to him, that is the best healing he could ask for"
>you kiss Jane on the head and stand
>She puts a gentle paw on your arm
>"Alright Shaxx, When’s the next fight"

Chapter 18: I would do anything for you
>It's been a few weeks since your first boxing match
>Despite your unorthodox entrance into the boxing community you are undefeated
>Turns out Shaxx's idea to picture that fuckbag Derek's face on every opponent worked
>You had a growing fan base as well as you were already kind of a celebrity in the Anthro slums
>A lot of them had heard stories of your past, and most came with the purpose to see if the rumors were true
>But there was one crowd in particular that you only cared for the most
>Word was that all of your earnings were donated to the orphanage you grew up in
>It soon came to be that whenever you were at work you'd be approached by the occasional person asking for a picture with you
>Even through the attack the UltraLux had reopened rather quickly, and all the 'extra help' were hired on full time for added security
>For now though it was quiet
>You and Jane were at Isabelle's house for the night, and you currently occupied yourself with cooking dinner
>While Biodispenser can make cooked food, you preferred certain foods cooked by hand, steaks being one of them
>Plus Isabelle's Biodispenser was top of the line, making food of much better quality then yours
>Currently you had it put out a couple of raw Kobe steaks which you seasoned and had thrown on the Indoor BBQ Isabelle's stove had on it
>the lobsters boiling in a pot to your left got the same attention to detail as their tails have always been a kind of rare treat
>You were even wrestling with a bowl that consisted of white wine, some butter and garlic to go on them
>Through the steam and sizzling pops you could hear Jane and Isabelle casually chatting away as they played some kind of 3rd person game you hadn't heard of
>They had become good friends, playing games together and occasionally watching Anime movies
>You, rather surprisingly, enjoyed the movie 'Akira' that Isabelle recommended
>Hearing a lull in the conversation, you took a quick walk out of the kitchen
>"Who wants a beer?" you call into into the main room
>"ME!" they call to you in unison
>Making your way back and after a quick peek into her fridge, you soon walked back with the only beer Isabelle had
>You were almost hesitant at first to grab them, the labels reading 'Weihenstephan Hafe Weissbier,' an expensive import from Terra
>Doubly so from the taxes placed on them by the New German Republic
>You opened the traditionally non-twist bottles (an impressive feat made easy through augs)
>Isabelle had decorated a lot since the first time you visited
>the once bare walls are now covered in framed anime posters, replicas of swords, signed comics-
>Manga. Right, that's what they were called. She made sure to correct you twice on that, and a brief shudder ripped through your spine as you remembered the little rant that followed
>You could find these and more decorating the place here and there
>It was a little odd at first to see a framed poster in front of the guest toilet, but you didn't question it
>She had the space and then some for it all though
>Jane was wearing a black tank top and jean shorts while Isabelle wore a "sailor moon" (whatever that was) shirt and jeans
>The two sat on a large couch that dominated the center floor, and they both sported a down right manic look with their eyes plastered on the wall sized Holoscreen
>Another trick you learned recently was not to walk in front of them during their moments like this
>Luckily the way the couch was set up allowed you to walk behind it so you could deliver the beverages
>Looking at the screen you see that Jane is clearly beating Isabelle, whose fur was slowly rising giving you all the notes you needed
>'Sweaty,' another word added to your slowly growing dictionary courtesy of Jane seemed to fit
>"Thanks Anon," Isabelle chirps, not breaking eye contact with the Holoscreen
>A quick "Thanks babe," to your right followed
>Jane has your wrist in a gentle grab while she pulls you down to her level
>You felt a quick kiss while she did
>You were still looking up as Isabelle tried to use the opportunity to strike at Jane's character only to get kicked off an edge
>"GOD FUCKING DAMMIT," the sound of a controller flying across the room
>"HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?! HOW ARE YOU THAT GOOD?!" She was already stomping around the room
>"Space magic," was Jane's only reply
>Returning to the couch Isabelle grabs her beer and chugs it down
>You feel your heart break a little, that beer was too good for chugging
>"I WANT A GODDAMN REMATCH! NO ITEMS"
>The rage is real
>Quickly remembering food was on the line, you pulled yourself back to the kitchen
>Seeing it still in great condition, you set out various plates and fill them, preparing the tails and doling out sauces
>"I'm bringing the food and I swear to god Isabelle, if you throw this fucking plate in a fit it’ll be you flying into your own goddamn pool"
>You meant it too, you worked hard on this
>On one of your visits Isabelle gave you a quick little tour, and during it she showed off her spacious backyard pool, complete with a hot tub to boot
>Because of the Rings weather control Station swimming was a year round thing and you couldn't wait to try it out, especially now that Jane could be invited
>The cooling thoughts of the water only barely kept the burn you currently felt from the two hot plates you carried
>OOOOH JESUS IT WAS HOT
>Ignoring your own warning a moment ago you were rushing to the table almost tripping in the process
>With shaky hands you hurriedly set dinner down on each respective end table for the ladies, trying to get the heat off them
>The two ignored you, seemingly back at it again
>A character you assumed to be Isabelle's is flying off the stage again, while a man in tight spandex kept flexing around screaming "Show me ya moves! HHYESSS!"
>Isabelle's sweaty rage levels were beyond capacity, and ignoring the potential burn pain that follows your hand quickly found itself between her two furry ears in a hurried attempt at calming her down
>Jane was sitting calmly while smiling at Isabelle
>Isabelle's split second appreciation gave way to frantic arm flails shooing your petting attempts away
>You shot your hands back in mock submission while she looks your way
>"You can’t beat her you know, Jane used to do tournaments for games like this. I think she came in first for a few of them"
>"I came in first 7 times, thank you very much," Jane corrected you with a small little wave
>A few grumbles from Isabelle's way seemed to put an end to it, at least for now
>The two of them finally noticed the feast you slaved over
>"Ooo Anon this looks good!" Jane says poking her steak with a fork, "where did you learn to cook like this"
>"Extranet"
>Isabelle isn't even trying to use her fork and knife to eat, the steak firmly locked between her jaws as an angry growl or two is heard
>wew lad she mad
>Her hands are still twitching on the controller while she chews on the meat
>You notice Jane not so subtly giving you winks towards hers sitting next to her
>She scoots over a bit as you sit between the two, grabbing the controller
>"Here, play me," you say while a wild eyed Isabelle looks your way
>The meat juice dribbling down her muzzle didn't really help with the image
>After a few rapid flicks from her paws, the two of you were at a selection screen
>Noticing the character Jane played, you swivel the cursor over it before locking him in
>The growling beside you increased tenfold from that
>Besides the proverbial beat down that was about to occur, you couldn't help but crack a smile at it all
>Two gorgeous ladies, video games, beer, and a whole spread of surf n' turf
>Not even the sounds of "SHOW ME YOUR MO-AUUUGH," brought you down
>It was a total and complete loss on your end, but the sight of her steak finally on her plate (minus the large bite mark out of it,) and the sounds of clinking metal on either side followed with a satisfied grin on both faces made it all worth it
>Jane has the controller back after her plate is cleared
>Her other hand went north and pulled you along with it
>She gives you a deep kiss
>"Mmmm, that was tasty Anon, thank you"
>"Get a room you two," while Isabelle gave off a fake retch
>Jane gave her a quick look up and down, "why - you offering one?" she ended with a smirk
>You felt that this next retch was real
>"NO! I don't need to hear that! I don't WANT to hear that!"
>You could only chuckle as you got up and fixed yourself a plate to bring back to the lounge
 
 
>After about 3-4 hours of Jane and Isabelle playing games, you decide to call it a night
>A stand, some stretching, and a chorus of pops and relief from your back greets you after sitting in that admittedly comfortable couch for all that time
>"Hey, I'm going to head out. We gotta hang out like this later"
>Jane gets up and stretches as well, her long tail flicking peacefully behind her
>"Yeah I'm going to head out too, Anon and me need to find a room," giving a wink at Isabelle
>"Gross! Alright, get out of here with that!"
>She throws a small pillow at Jane
>A light catch and a throw later it finds itself back at the source, hitting Isabelle's generous chest with a slight BOOF
>"We'll catch you later," you say as the two of you wave and walk out, Isabelle still holding the pillow
>You jump onto your Hoverbike and Jane gets into her FloCar
>"I'll meet you at your place Anon, I gotta grab something from my apartment," she calls out
 
 
>Your Hoverbike roars forwards through the sea of FloCars
>The star of Alpha Centauri is setting on the artificial horizon while the wind whips by sending a small shiver down your spine
>For once, the ring is beautiful to see and look up at while the underside lazily turns on by
>You try and fail to suppress some small amount of apprehension
>Times are looking up again
>A small part of you reminds you that bad times always happen before hand
>But... maybe this time will be different
>You park your bike and head inside
 
 
>You had more decoration up now in your apartment
>Jane had been giving you random but interesting Knick knacks to display or put up, saying "it's almost depressing in here, Anon"
>Isabelle had given you an Akira poster that had Kaneda walking towards his bike - the imagery giving you the courage to try it before
>You could consider Isabelle a close friend of yours, even though she can be a bit awkward and was still technically your parole officer
>A quick boot from your computer you pulled up a few threads you frequented, as well as the boxing circuit schedule you were participating in, and a few news sites
>The executive of the UltraLux who told the now former boss about the stuff in the casino vault was sent to prison
>Flinn, your old shitbag of a boss was given life in prison as well
>You sit back and relax a bit until you hear Jane enter with the sound of things dropping on your kitchen counter
>Looking back you see she's wearing one of your old leather jackets, it being more than a size or two too large but also accented her golden fur and blonde hair
>"So what did you have to grab Jane?"
>She turns to you smiling and holding up two things
>It's a mask and a webcam
>What
>"Jane, I, what?"
>She smiles mischievously at you
>"My fans have been asking me to do a hardcore shoot for a long time, now"
>The ill-fitting jacket falls off her shoulders and onto the floor
>Your mouth drops open
>She's wearing a tight pink mesh top, her nipples poking through the stretched thin fabric and a very small blue thong to match
>"We're gonna give them a show"
>You sit dumbfounded for a moment
>"Uhh ok, what do I do? Why do I need the mask?"
>She seductively walks to you, swaying her ample hips a little more than necessary
>"You wear this mask because I want the viewers to focus on me and all you have to do is enjoy the ride, it’s for me to show off everything and for you to just enjoy and hold off Cumming until its time"
>She hands you the mask and runs a hand down your chest
>"So what do you say love?"
>You snap on the black mask that covers your eyes and nose
>"Let’s have some fun"
>She jumps in excitement causing her breasts to jiggle
>You wait as she busies herself setting it all up, waving her glorious ass at you
>This was going to be fun
 
 
>You're sitting in your recliner, the back rest pushed back slightly
>Jane is sitting in your lap, casually grinding on you, the thong tossed aside
>She's talking straight ahead, the whole setup focused entirely on the two of you
>On the monitor was a chatroom she had setup, a staggering amount of people could already be seen
>What? Did she post about this somewhere? How long had she planned this?
>Your thoughts where cut off by Jane answering various questions
>The pervy ones she talked about, you could feel her shift a little harder over you
>The more innocent ones seemed to slow it down
>You could barely see your masked face behind hers, a small remote she had seemingly controlling the view
>"Hey guys and gals~ Here I am, Janet Diamond, finally going to do something a little bit different with a veeeery special guest!"
>She talks so seductively to the camera you could feel yourself to getting diamond hard
>You could only imagine how her viewers were feeling
>They got a full view of her, pants less and wearing that gorgeous mesh top, while you got a view of her back
>Granted her glorious ass is in full view so you reached forward and grabbed a handful
>She jumps a little in surprise and looks back at you with a twinkle in her eyes
>"MMM someone’s ready to get this started!"
>Her smile is intoxicating and her light purrs send vibrations through your body
>>"Now then, let’s look at what we're working with"
>She pulls your undergarments down, releasing your full erection
>She scoots back so she’s sitting on your stomach, your member between her thick thighs
>"Look at his HUMAN cock! Look at how big it is!"
>She rubs her thighs together, and you couldn't hold back a small groan
>Her delicate pads could be felt lightly gripped at the base, the feeling of fur soon leaving from her slightly spread thighs
>It got increasingly harder to stay quiet
>She broke the silence first
>"Look at it! So big!" a tug, "No spikes, no knots!” a rub, "Just big human cock! And its's AAAAAALLLL going inside me~" a long sensual final stroke
>Her thighs are pressed around your shaft, tight but not tight enough to be fully satisfying
>You can feel how wet she is as she rubs your cock between her legs
>Still rubbing away, she leans back into you
>One arm under her breasts, the other covering her mouth
>"Mmmm Anon, you're bigger than I remember," she whispers to you and you alone
>The camera isn't focused on you and your barely restrained twitching, everyone and everything was glued to her
>She's the star and you're just along for the sexy ride
>You feel the fur of her thighs rub you softly
>She's actively grinding herself on top of you, that wetness more and more noticeable
>"Look at it all, he's soooooo big," she moans at her audience
>As fast as before all the sensations stopped, her weight once again leaving you
>The comments were a furious storm as the seconds ticked by
>"Now, can you all be good for juuust a second?" she's off screen, the webcam pointed solely at you while you sat there as steady as can be
>You knew you'd be a large part of it, but not the center of attention
>You heard something dragging across the carpet
>Jane had somehow managed to drag your other recliner next to yours
>She took a moment to compose herself before her second grand entrance, wetness dripping from between her legs
>"Good boys~" she said looking back at the cam
>The purpose of the other recliner was made clear; her lower body rested on top of it with the rest of her on yours
>Quick, hot breaths swirling around your member with short little pants between each one
>The tip of her muzzle was right at the base, and you almost lost it right there from the small little licks she was giving you
>"Mmmmm look at this cock so big and sexy"
>It’s all a show for her fans but goddamn even her voice makes you diamonds
>Her paw constantly rubbing up and down you isn't helping
>You feel a soft tongue on the head of you member
>Her tongue is rough but tender as it envelops you
>"Mmmm look at it all, these human cocks are the best"
>You sneak a peek at the chat which has exploded into a frenzy
>Her plump ass waving in front of the camera, you sitting getting your shaft licked tenderly
>"Let’s see how far I can take it into my throat" she purrs
>The camera focuses on her licking your shaft up and down slowly
>She takes the tip into her mouth and you feel her lick small circles around your member
>She then forces herself down on you
>You feel her gagging slightly as she tries to get your cock deeper into her throat
>A few small licks, the feeling of her throat trying to take you all in
>She coughs a bit and goes down slowly until she’s at your base
>Her raspy tongue coils delicately around your member
>The vibrations from her constant purring
>The sensations are nearly overwhelming
>Her head comes back up, your cock slipping out of her mouth with a small wet 'pop'
>She coughs once and looks at the camera
>"He's sooo big I can barely handle it"
>The chat is going mad about it
>Her paw wraps around your shaft and she strokes it gently while reading what the chat asks
>She absentmindedly licks and strokes you
>The lull in sensations allow you to calm down between the thigh rubbing and her impressive deep throat abilities had set you close to the edge
>Her touch and gentle licks feel amazing
>You reach over and grab a handful of her impressive ass, causing her to squeak in surprise
>Purring gently she takes your cock into her mouth once more
>She looks back at the camera as she bobs her head up and down gently, causing you to gasp slightly
>You feel yourself getting close
>"B-babe I’m gonna-"
>She releases your shaft from her mouth and purrs at you
>"Mmmmm, not yet~"
>She stands and twirls in front of the camera before peeling off her top
>"Who likes what they see," she purrs to her audience
>You wanted to say "Me" because she was absolutely stunning
>Her body would put Aphrodite to shame, those large shapely tits, her perfect ass, the rippling muscle
>You can tell she’s stalling as she rubs her breasts in front of the camera, pulling her nipples and gasping occasionally
>You take the chance to come down from nearly releasing as she teases and cooes at her viewers
>"Ready for the main event?"
>You can't tell if she’s asking you or the camera but you don’t care
>She gets back in your lap, your shaft between her plump thighs
>Lifting herself gently, she positions her dripping slit
>"Ready?" she purrs to the camera
>You put your hands on her ample hips and slowly lower her onto you
>Inch but inch you cock slides into her wetness
>She gasps and shivers slightly
>"Ohhh god you're bigger than I remember," she gasps to you
>You sneak a peek at the Chat and see its gone into a full fit as she grinds on you
>Her paws push her breasts together as she starts slowly bouncing on you
>Your hands guide her rhythm as you feel her soft fur between your fingers
>"Oooo so big," she gasps for the camera
>Even with all that teasing she did, she didn't last long either
>Her walls clamp down on you and you feel a wave of warm liquid gush out as she shudders
>"O-oh god he's made me s-squirt" Jane gasps as she falls back onto your chest, a paw idly rubbing your hidden cheek
>The chat is going wild
>Your hands snake their way up her body and grip her tits and pull her nipples softly
>"H-holy fuck babe," Jane gasps in your ear
>You feel her hot insides pulse gently as you put your hands back on her hips
>Slowly you begin pumping her up and down
>She gasps and pinches her nipples as you speed up
>"You like t-that guys and g-gals? You like seeing t-this big h-human cock fuck me?" She gasps to the camera
>Every motion brings her a shudder with her insides gripping tighter
>"Mmm~! Do it harder!"
>She’s bouncing hard and fast on you, her pussy quivering from the sensations
>Her hands are on your knees for extra leverage pumps hard like a piston
>You begin bucking up into her, keeping the pace and rhythm
>Her purring fills your head and you squeeze her ample hips and ass
>You feel her tail wrapped around your neck like a fuzzy boa
>She’s gasps; a quick, final shudder wracks through her body and another splash soaks your crotch
>You continue pumping into her as her walls clamp down hard
>"O-h -g-god I-I’m g-going to"
>Another spray of liquid gushes out of her
>A squeak escapes her, a final involuntary shudder physically vibrating her before finally she melts against you
>The top of her head sits comfortably at the base of your chin, her ears flicking lightly
>"Mmmm babe kiss me," she purrs as she turns her head to you
>Your head's grabbed on either side and brought down while her tongue finds with way into your mouth
>Her tongue is raspy and tender at the same time, your tongue finds its way into her mouth and you feel those dangerous teeth in her perfect mouth
>She breaks and gasps as you pump harder into her
>Her walls tighten and you feel the pressure within you almost at a peak
>"B-babe I’m gonna cum!" you groan, a hard buck to end it with
>"Y-YES! Give kitty her cream!"
>With a final thrust you erupt inside her, your waiting finally over
>Finally satisfied, you slump back, your legs spasming gently as she grinds and rides you
>She lifts herself off you gently
>You glimpse at the monitor and see her spread pussy lips, your seed leaking out of her
>"That's how it done guys," her purrs louder than ever
>"Hope you all enjoyed the show~!"
>*Click*
>The camera feed shuts off, and with it the multiple windows
>You pull Jane into another kiss
>The afterglow surrounds you both
>She nuzzles into your lap and you wrap your arms around her
>Finally off stream, the two of you can truly feel at ease
>You're giving her back a slow rub, your other hands grasped in hers
>Her constant purring is a slow, long out droll, a small sigh escaping her while she burrows deeper into your chest
>"I Love you Jane," was all you could say
>"I love you too Anon," was all that was needed
>The two of you stay that way, but the both of you soon agreed to a quick cleanup
>Your reluctance to leave didn't last long, for soon after a quick fix up, you both relax under the comforter in your bed
>The snuggling never stopping when you turned off the lights
>What a great evening

Chapter 19: Roller Mobster
>You awake from a particularly strong purring noise close to your ear
>A light occasional tickling, followed by a small wet feeling would sometimes join it
>To top it all, light warm puffs of air joined in the mix in a slow constant pattern
>At some point during the night Jane had moved and grabbed you, her muzzle could felt in the crook of your neck and her arms to your chest in a light fluffy hug
>You made a rather large smaller spoon
>She had been staying over at your apartment a lot more recently
>Honestly, you couldn't blame her
>Having the best snuggle buddy a guy could ask for is nothing to complain about
>And only to her you were pretty damn cuddly yourself
>So with a small silent curse at your job and the need for money, you slowly and carefully peeled yourself from that warm embrace to step out into the cold dark
>It's a bit hard getting everything you need to start your day from your bedroom in the dark, but you manage nonetheless
>You had even gotten good at keeping silent whenever a chair or a table leg got in your way
>It was even harder to leave when your eyes had adjusted for the last thing you'd see every time is her Jane's sleeping form
>Today, your blankets had wrapped themselves tight to her sides, and whatever light that leaked through would catch on her long blond hair that pooled around her golden fur
>You had recently started to become weirdly poetic in the mornings
>Hot damn was she worth it though, and you were lucky to have her with you
>She had a way of bringing out the best in you
>With the door closed, you could finally be a bit louder, your size had always made it difficult to sneak around
>Food was a priority when you did
>In no time at all, your standard bacon and eggs with a tall glass of orange juice was done
>You were munching on it quietly while you browsed the usual threads you frequented, your setup now in a corner in the living room
>The little show you and Jane hosted was still buzzing around
>The especially jealous posters loved to cry CGI being used, that you were just an advanced sex bot since no human could be THAT big
>They had to of been a special kind of stupid to not notice the two steam vents lodged in your shoulders - you sure as hell know that those things were on full blast during the highly publicized casino raid a while ago
>Or maybe they did
>Their tears at you with your girlfriend and your ability to jump down five floors suddenly made it all the better
>You took an extra noisy sip o' OJ at that
>It wasn't all shitposting though, a lot of them were positive too
>A few Anthro 'Ladies'(Like that's a thing on the Extranet) kept posting how the stream gave them courage to pursue a human mate
>One of them in particular seemed to really be going at it writing a green about it, the OP quickly getting swarmed by those very same 'Lady' IPs
>You left the thread when Jane became John
>Out of time to kill, you busied yourself with the rest of the morning
>A call on your Holophone made you stop before the door
>'Rhiannon'
>Your heart sank a little looking at the still saved profile image of her
>Did you really want to deal with this now?
>You called upon your stores of thread lurking idiocy to decide in the fastest way as possible
>NOPE.jpg
>You clicked end call, and head out the door
 
 
>The roar of your Hoverbike is drowned out by the buzzing in your head
>Thoughts of Jane's beautiful body on yours
>Isabelle finally opening up about that weeb shit she liked and forcing you to watch some of it
>Rhiannon reaching out to you after nearly two weeks of silence
>...
>It's not like you were going to stay in touch with her now, not with how she was the one who snuffed you
>She has nothing on Jane, her only purpose thinking back to fill the hole that you hadn't realized was there
>Stupid
>Stupid of you to let it grow in the first place
>Stupid at how you were the one who let Jane go back then
>A dumb kid who saw the mafia as a way out of poverty, for the small cost of losing her heart
>...In a way, she was better than you ever could be
>Despite that fear of you then, and what you are now - she still came back
>Fate, Chaos, whatever Cthulhu based deity that saw fit to give you another chance, you swore you wouldn't squander it
>You smile and breathe in the cool morning air
 
 
>You park your bike in the usual spot, the garage system in place patiently waiting for you to get off
>As always the moment you're clear, it swallowed the platform whole while another one took it place
>You're not sure if it’s fucking with you or not
>One scratch on that bike is all it’ll take for you to give it a thorough rewiring
>You're previously ruffled clothes is quickly replaced with your custom made fashion forward bullet resistant attire while you make your way to the elevator
>It isn't far to the staging room from here and in no time at all, you're already closing the door
>You stand there for a second, the sound of metal and papers leaving both arms outstretched in front of you
>"Hey Titan!" chirps Nelly as she's laying in your arms
>You're already heading to the nearest chair while the rest of the team give their various hellos
>Sitting down with a comb in hand and the fox in your lap, you're gently brushing her fur
>You spot Mia playing on her Holophone hunched over a chair and her elbows on one of the new tables Shaxx and Eugene had to pay for
>The table smasher in question was busying himself with a hologram of your last fight, the bull nodding his head and taking notes on your form
>You already feel the oncoming headache from the numerous Datachips he'd give you for whatever flaw he saw
>Ronnie is quickly scribbling away, drawing something that you can't really see
>You can't spot Lawrence anywhere, so either he isn't here or he's creeping on someone
>He's definitely not outside that door though with the minor floor shakes telling you Alexandra is out there
>You didn't even bother to notice the gorilla in the corner until a loud "HELLO EUGENE", a girly scream and a thud with the sound of a laughing Lawrence grabbing everyone's eyes
>You and a few others joined in the laughter at the blustering Eugene trying in vain to save his dignity
>"Not cool!" a metallic finger pointed at the chuckling chameleon, "I've just been a bit jumpy from a scary movie last night!"
>The laughs got a little louder at that
>The door opens again for Axel, typing away at a laptop with the sound of a TV looping a shrieking falling Eugene
>"We will NEVER let you live this down," squeaks Drak through your combing
>"NOOOO DAMMIT!"
>The door to Steven's office opens from the mink himself walking through it
>He sees the clip, and a smirk breaks out on his face
>"Alright everyone," he addressed the room, "your assignments have been sent to your earpieces"
>You hear a noise with some text that scrolls by in your vision
>"Let’s have a good morning out there"
>You pocket Nelly's comb while she slides off your lap, and a quick fistbump with Ronnie later you're on the job
 
 
>The life on the floor is a stark contrast to the night of the robbery
>The constant din of laughter, machines, and buzzing conversations could be heard over smooth music
>It all meant so much more now that you've seen the other side
>You almost couldn't believe it had happened while you stood there watching the crowds
>Where you were, you saw a couple happily chatting away and standing where Mia had bled not that long ago
>A look above you showed the pristine balconies as perfect as the tiles below them, not a hint of your fall to be found
>The only occasional stain you would see is from a spilled drink here or there, and none of it red
>In a way, your shift was slow; you would walk around looking intimidating, having it work until the odd fan or two would ask you for a photo
>A lot of them stared, tapping their neighbor and pointing at you while you worked
>All in all a quiet typical night with the only awkward highlight being a large Anthro giraffe giving you her number
>You hope she took it well when you told her the only lady on the ring for you was Jane
>.
>..
>...
>Time flowed by steadily and peacefully, and soon you lost track of it all
 
 
>A ring in your ear followed by an alert icon snapped you back to reality
>You thought you've been here longer than two hours, but the earpiece's HUD kept telling you it was four in the morning
>Weirdly, it also said Isabelle was calling you and you're pretty sure she isn't up this early
>You accept and an image of her flies up to you
>She's crying, the sound of it freezing you in front of a man
>"Buddy, wha-" your hand covers his mouth, the shorter man now in front of you grabbing at your arm
>"Isabelle? What’s wrong?" you're looking over him
>You heard it again, another muffled sob
>The man you held was on the floor and all he could do was yell inaudibly to your far off sprinting form
>"They're in the house, I think they're stealing everything but don't know I'm here," she's doing her best to keep quiet, "help me, please!"
>"I'll be right there!" you were lucky no one was in front of you with the sounds of Isabelle's stiffed rapid breathing driving you on
>You tore across the concrete to your awaiting bike, leaping on it when you could
>You barely managed to slip on your glove and slam the helmet clip to your ear, putting on both while you burned out the building
 
 
>The early morning traffic did little to stop you while all the drivers’ saw of you was a glowing green blur
>You're redlining it, pushing her hard where a single twitch would end you both
>250 MPH... 260 MPH, higher and higher when you didn't need to turn
>You yelled at your earpiece to dial several different contacts
>Steven picked up first, "Titan?"
>"Steven, I'm heading to my parole officers house, she said she's being robbed-FUCKER," you had to swerve around an impatient FloCar, >"I'm heading there now!" you yelled over the wind
>"Understood Titan, has she called the authorities?"
>Another swerve
>"I don't know"
>The sound of keys cuts through the noise and your HUD starts to draw a route through the traffic
>"The police are locked onto you, they'll be there shortly"
>"Thanks," you didn't hear his response while you waited for Jane to pick up
>"MmnAnon?" she mumbles, "it's like, 4 in the morning... what’s going on?"
>"Isabelle called me, she's being robbed, I'm headed there now"
>"Be careful, Anon," she didn't sound tired anymore
>The lights from the FloCars molded together and raced across your helmet
>Little by little, you went faster and faster while the world around you blurred
>You felt faster than light driving down the highway
>You really wished you were
 
 
>Isabelle's FloCar was gone, probably already at a chop shop, the lights in her home darkened and the door kicked in
>You already had your shotgun in hand
>"Isabelle?" you call out
>You're in her living room now and all you could see was the sight of her couch flipped over, collections on the floor and the rest of her furniture in different forms of smashed
>"Isabelle!"
>Fuck the element of surprise, you needed to find her
>Weapon up, you glide room to room viewing destruction as you do
>Every empty room you find makes you a little heavier, your grip tighter every time
>You stop and try to listen for anything at all
>A thumb is heard above you
>'Upstairs!' you dared to hope
>As fast and quiet as you can, you made your way up the stairs
>Guest room: Nothing
>Hall bathroom: Empty
>Hers...
>There they are
>You peak through a crack in the door and your eyes immediately fall on Isabelle huddled on the ground
>She's openly weeping, tears silently running down her face and a gun to her head
>A crowbar hangs to her side, the owner of it now lifting her chin up
>You notice her eyes go wide as she spots you, and in that moment you finally see the others
>Two human men are in the room with her
>One of them is passing around and the other stands to her side
>They've turned to you now, the one with the crowbar slowly walking towards you
>"I know you’re out there," the one with the gun says
>He pressed the barrel deeper into her hair with another gasp from Isabelle
>The guy with the crowbar is almost at the door
>You see a cruel sneer on his scarred tattooed face
>Tattoos...
>You almost didn't recognize it at first
>These men were Tribals
>Before your stint in prison, the Tribal's only agenda was as stupid as their space-hick ways: extortion, murder, and the enslavement of Anthros to the highest bidder
>It was almost funny how retarded the two major mob groups this side of the ring were
>They hated Anthros, the Anthros them hated back
>It got to the point where both sides you had to personally meet, stomp, repeat
>You were good at that
>The group you ran with came out on top from it
>And now, it would be no different
>"Alright Superman, whatever your carrying, you'd best give it here now," the gunman said
>"Or Lois here’ll be no more," you heard a yelp from Isabelle, the gun to her head pressed deeper into her hair
>You crouched low to the floor, your shotgun aimed where you think he would be as it started to shake from the power being called to your Augs
>You could already feel the heat in your arms starting to rise
>The shotgun fell to the floor and hearing that the guy with the crowbar opened the door
>He kicked the shotgun away from you and took a few steps back with it fully out of your reach
>He grabbed it where it stopped inches from Isabelle
>"To think this wolf had friends with fancy toys like this," he gave a whistle upon turning it around in his hands and admiring it from all sides
>"Shoulda robbed her weeks ago," he finished looking down the sight and the barrel pointed at you
>You never moved from your spot in the hall, the heat in your arms causing the vents to kick on
>"We ain't here for the stuff she has idiot," the man with the pistol was glaring at his cohort, "dumbass here is blocking the exit"
>They're both looking your way now
>A quick breath later and he calms down again, adding "you know she's worth more than all the shit here"
>Your fists started to close at that
>You've personally seen what they do to the ones they catch
>They would 'train' them, break them down and reform them into sex slaves
>It didn't matter the age or gender
>You thought you put a stop to that
>At his worst, Flinn made it a personal cause to murder every single one of them who did this
>Before prison, it was yours too
>And now, with the two of them acting so casually about it...
>You frown, the heat never leaving you
>One of them notices and the one with your gun aims straight at your head now
>"If you want to leave, you'll have to kill me first," you say calmly "otherwise I'll kill you"
>"You serious?" he takes a step forward, "look man, move - we just want the wolf"
>You crack your knuckles feeling your Augs ready to go
>They both give a small laugh, the one with the pistol stopping first
>"Yeah, kill 'I’m," he says
>The guy with your shotgun pulled the trigger
>*Click,* nothing happens
>"Huh?"
>"Omae wa mou shindeiru," you repeat a phrase Isabelle taught you, smiling 
>"The fuck!?"
>There's a moment's hesitation from the shotgun guy, a brief look of confusion on the pistol wielding man, and an unknowable expression breaks out over Isabelle's face
>It's all you need
>You rush forward, but pistol man's fast on the draw
>Too bad that it didn't do shit to your work clothes, his three bullets being absorbed easily
>You bodied him straight into the back wall and even through that he still made the effort to unload two more right to your gut
>Your winded, but fine with one hand to his neck and the other curled for a punch
>You never got it off with your world an explosion of pain
>The man behind you had his crowbar again, you felt something give from the blood that started to pour from your ear
>Turning around showed him rearing for another strike, the only thing you thought to do was to throw his friend at him
>A perfect hit
>The two crumple over each other and Isabelle thankfully had the sense to crawl to the side
>You stand there gasping for air
>Its hard to see, let alone walk with how your vision swam
>You take a clumsy step forward
>Of all the street trash you fought in your life, this one actually goes for the head
>With a fucking crowbar of all things
>You had to stop to catch another gasp
>Taking your chance to do so you pause to scan the room
>You find Isabelle curled in a corner with both arms covering her head
>The sound of shoes on carpet grabs your attention back to the two would be kidnappers
>The two had untangled themselves, the man you charged barely moving on the ground and the other standing crowbar in hand
>You took a step towards him, and a flash of light blinds you
>Sharp pain radiates from the side of your head
>He hadn't hit you again
>He was doing his hardest though
>Through it all you grabbed the bar mid strike and you held on
>He was struggling to rip it out for another swing at you
>You thought you were steady, but a pull from him sends you staggering and falling to your knees
>Weeks ago you murdered scores of garbage like him!
>Damn this headache!
>A new pain explodes on your body
>The bar hit you hard on your ribs knocking the wind out of you
>You couldn't support your own weight
>Your level with the other man groaning on the floor
>At the sound of metal cuts through the air you raised your arms above you feeling another strike
>Your thankful you never lowered them as another swing glances off them
>That second hit felt weaker than before, but even then it's still hard to stand
>You jumped down the length of a small building, yet a dude with a bar keeps you down
>The side of your head and shoulder is getting progressively wetter while you kneel there
>Head trauma, it's definitely the worst case you can remember
>You were in the middle of another sharp stabbing episode when you realized a third hit never game
>A shriek behind you told you why
>The man has an arm around Isabelle's neck and the other with the pistol just above it
>She was almost standing on her feet and being brutally dragged well out of your reach by that man
>The one closer to you was still, his neck having been snapped from your throw
>"Shoulda listened," he said between breaths making his way to the hall
>"Yeah," you begin, "you should have"
>The force of your recently re-materialized shotgun rocketed it out of your bruised arms and the glove on your hand sparked erratically with it
>The smell of plasma and burned flesh quickly permeated the air, slowly burning wood joining in as well
>Your body was numb to all but the fire in your limbs and hot air they desperately tried to expel
>The human you shot didn't scream as he stared at his missing arm and pieces of torso, the wounds already burned shut
>He was slowly sliding down the wall, eyes open wide and not making a sound
>You went to stand, slowly at first until the Augs in your legs would support you
>You picked up the crowbar in your slow ascent until eventually but uneasily you were towering over the little human

 
>You looked down on its cowering form
>It was dirty, matted with sweat and burnt clothes loosely hugging it
>The tattoos on its face were warped into scars and around its neck was an angry red wound
>No wonder it couldn't scream
>You would try your best though
>Your glove gave a final jolt and the human below you shook as both the remains of the fabric and the now bent crowbar fell from your hand
>You didn't need it anyways, not with how you worked
>Your muscles were numb as you stood there fully supported by your now fiery augs with the sound of air barely keeping you alive
>You decided to relieve the pressure, and crouched down before it
>It struggled even more from the heat you were radiating with its final attempt at life trying to choke you out
>Your head still hurt
>You remembered that this was the thing that caused it
>It was only fair you'd do it back
>Your hands covered its reddened face fingers digging in the greasy hair, and your thumbs resting on its now closed eyes
>You began to push from a voice in your mind gleefully cheering at you
>With a wild arm it drove a splinter into your hand and you felt its other gripped tighter around you
>Your hands pressed together and your thumbs dug down poised to dive
>But once again the voice was silenced from the sound of another saying your name
>You didn't feel skin around your neck or from the hand cupping yours
>Warm pads gripped tighter on yours pulling yours away
>The furry mass around you was shaking on your steaming form as you slowly let go of the man
>You thought Jane had come to save you again, but it was black furred arms that pulled you away
>The two of you sat there in her burnt bloodied room
>Your Augs slowly cooled from the hiss that escaped you and the warm of Isabelle holding you never leaving
>She never stopped saying your name or telling you that everything would be fine
>The side of your neck was drenched by the time your head had become a dull throb
>"Sorry for bleeding on your carpet," you tried to laugh in a brief moment of clarity
>It was replaced by another sharp flash of light
>You couldn't really see anything after as her already dim bedroom started to fade
>You blink, and you're suddenly in the hallway
>"It's ok Anon, stay awake, come on!" you felt another tug bring you closer to the stairs
>Despite her size she was under your arms pushing as hard as she could
>Even when you could barely see you still had a wet hand to the wall
>You only managed to lift a leg, catching her in your arms while the two of you fell down the way
 
 
>You hear a muffled snapping noise and a horrible smell assault your nose
>Your hands are on your face from the worst hangover pain you've felt yet
>Dragging on down you cracked open an eye lid and standing before you was a black and white spotty blob
>"You still with us? Damn, you're a tough guy," it said
>You groaned pulling your other lid open too with both eyes trying to focus
>Soon the blob molds into the shape of a concerned looking Dalmatian paramedic holding a a box that reeked of smelling salts
>You blinked at him a couple of times and snag a look around
>You're still in Isabelle's house it seems and sitting on a blanket
>It's the first floor of her house where the ruins of her things were being picked at by various officers in uniforms
>Isabelle is talking to one behind you looking absolutely matted with fur and hair sticking up everywhere
>The... man she was talking to would occasionally nod and write down in his notes
>"Isabelle," you croak out, "you ok?"
>She jumps at the sound of your voice
>"ANON! You're ok?!," she left the officer behind and was standing over you
>"For now? Sure," the Dalmatian is looking Isabelle's way, "he's been given a Nanite injection, and we got the iron solution down him safely"
>You coughed a bit at that, throat feeling a bit drier than normal
>"He should be dead, honestly," a gasp from Isabelle has a hand covering her face
>He had a light on your eye that you were trying to shoo his paw from
>"Stay," he growled with you fully complying
>You knew not to mess with sunbros
>He stood up from his crouched spot by your side and gave a small little stretch before turning back to Isabelle
>"His skull is fractured and he has a torn ear that didn't seem to clot properly," he gave another glance your way
>"Those bone density Augs of him kept him alive for the most part"
>"It’ll take more than head trauma to kill me," you wheezed out a lame chuckle
>Another cough, this time hurting a lot worse than normal
>'Ribs still hurt,' you gave another wheeze
>The Dalmatian gave a whistle and a human officer was quickly on the scene
>He politely moved Isabelle out of the way and stood to your right
>The pair then bent down and with both your arms to your sides, you got up to stand with them
>You leaned against the crutch he had waiting for you keeping up unsteadily
>He raised a fuzzy white eyebrow at you
>"Christ you're tall," he muttered as he walked away
>You didn't have the energy to be annoyed
>Especially since Isabelle's fur was clinging to your side again
>"Ribs!" you groaned out
>"Sorry..." she said, hugging you a little less intensely
>You are now aware of your lack of clothes, the only thing stuck to you that wasn't fur being your trusty commando printed briefs
>With a flick of your (somehow still present) earpiece your original outfit materializes
>The lower half of your pant legs sliding down to your feet and tattered shirt couldn't dampen your spirits
>You were apparently alive, and more importantly; so was Isabelle
>As you were tying a blanket around your waist that same human officer from before walked up to you
>He was looking you up and down with his gaze lingering just a bit longer to the burned black metal of a vent jutting just beyond your shoulder
>You adjusting the blanket to show Akira's mutant face over your groin brought back his attention
>"Sir? I have a few questions for you," he lowers his voice
>You blinked in response
>"First off:" he looked from side to side, before leaning in a bit, "do you know Janet Diamond?"
>You smile
>"Maybe, why do you ask?"
>He nods his head back towards your shoulder
>"That was a fun stream wasn't it?" you smile wider
>He looks as though he's seen the face of god, the mysteries of the universe itself having finally been solved
>You break him out of it
>"What other questions do you have?"
>He gave a quick "ah, sorry," and he leaned back reaching for an earpiece
>"Sir, we require any recordings you may have of your interaction with the men upstairs. Ms. Rey says you killed them in her defense"
>You furrowed your brow at that last one for even in your rage you knew you didn't go through with it
>"Here," you handed him your slightly caked on ear piece
>He grabbed it with a gloved hand and unpinned his own
>"It also has the robbery of the UltraLux and my... jump, if you wanted that too"
>Holding it a little more careful he made a few motions from one to the other
>Satisfied a minute later, he clicked back his own and handed yours back
>You pocketed it in the only one you had on your shirt
>"Thank you, Mr. Anon," he says with a shake of your hand
>He leaves talking with a finger pressed to his ear
>You feel Isabelle press into your side again, her muzzle a mix of relief and worry
>"Isabelle," you begin with the bodies still on your mind, "who were they to you, and how did they know you were here?"
>She looks down at her foot paws, tail and ears drooping down with her
>"The one that hit you was one of my parolees... I thought since I had brought you here, I could bring more of them in too"
>You sigh through the dull pain in your chest
>"Oh you poor sheltered thing," you say rubbing between her ears
>"What?! I wanted to trust them!" she slapped your hand away, "is that so wrong?!" he anger only rising from your look of pity at her
>"They're slavers, Isabelle, and specifically for Anthros," you lean a bit more into your crutch
>"What?" her previously crossed arms fall to her sides
>"They keep them for sex slaves... with your pink hair, your eyes, your," you clear your throat, "tracts of land..." with a safety cough to follow
>Her head is cocked to the side slightly, one of her wolfish ears standing on top
>"You being you - it probably made you a priority target"
>She looked like she wanted to say something but she couldn't come up with the words to do so
>Her head looks down at her paws with her arms hugged close to her chest again
>"I'm sorry Anon, you could have died," she finally speaks
>"But I didn't, don't worry about it"
>She didn't resist your heavy arm pulling her close
>You felt a tap on your shoulder
>Spinning around, that Dalmatian paramedic is holding your phone in an outstretched hand
>"Sir? I think it's for you," he gave it a wiggle
>Grabbing it with Isabelle sliding to the side, you flip it open
>A slightly distorted Jane materializes over it
>"Anon? OHMYGODISTHATBLOOD!" you almost threw the damn thing at that, and it definitely grabbed the attention of the other officers
>Making a mad hobble to the kitchen, Isabelle reluctantly follows along
>Catching your breath you look back to her projection
>She still has that terrified look going on
>You must have looked like the god damn bloody reaper to her
>You crack a smile
>"Yes it is, yes I'm fine, so is Isabelle, and can you come pick me up? I took a crowbar to the head," you rapidly spew out
>She's sputtering and her fur stood up higher with every moment
>A shaky paw was halfway to her mouth before it shoots away with the motion of her hair flipping about
>"I'll be right there," she yells, her hologram disappearing after
>You took a quick breath at that
>"Got any food? I'm starving"
>You hobbled your way past a near frozen Isabelle to the now upturned couch
>Your head is buzzing slightly from the bots doing their thing
>She finally reboots
>"Seriously you're hungry now!?" she's almost angry at this point
>"That would be a side effect of the Nanites," speaks a muzzle to your side
>Your arm is currently cramped up in pain, your hand shacking just inches from his neck as he casually lifts up a shot from your shoulder
>"It means they're working as intended and using the last thing he ate for fuel. The more he eats the faster it goes," he finished while putting a little band aid over your newest bullet wound
>"Again, surprising. Bruised arms, a broken rib, a torn ear and a fractured skull - would have killed any other man," he's packing away the rest of his gear
>"He took it like a champ in my book," pack secured he fished a paw into one of his pockets and threw what he found in your lap
>It was a small packet of four gray looking pills
>"Supplements, to help," he adds making his way to the door
>A quick glance at Isabelle shows you're once again on her good side
>"You're a lucky guy, you know?" he calls out
>You gave him some shaky finger guns with your other arm finally relaxing
>He gives a small laugh and takes his leave while the others file out the door
>You don't know when she left the room but a few minutes later and you start to smell something
>Soon the smell gets stronger and she's back in the living room
>She's back carrying a plate while doing her best to step around the broken pieces of furniture
>Quietly she sits to your side, and hands you whatever she made
>You look at it
>It looked like eggs got beaten into limp spaghetti
>"Isabelle what’s th-" she isn't even looking your way
>'Fuck it,' you shovel it in
>...
>Tastes like...
>Oh, it’s something alright
>You're quietly spooning it in to the sound of a slowly shifting body inching your way to you
>Eventually her haggard fur lightly rests to your side
>"I tried to make chicken ramen," she finally mutters
>You took another stab at it
>"You might have gotten it wrong," you leaned back to her taking another bite
>You’re hungry and it isn't killing you but you did add Biodispenser classes to the increasingly long list of things you'd do for her
>Quietly munching away with the couch protesting your resting form, you thought you caught the hint of a smile coming back from her with every bite you take
 
 
>It wasn't long before Jane arrived with your only clue being her heavy panting in the door frame
>"Anon, you look terrible," she says between breaths her fur on end as bad as Isabelle's
>You chuckle as you finish the almost ramen
>"You should've seen the other guys"
>She's already on you, and instead of the loving embrace you'd expected, a furry fist rocketed towards your shoulder
>"Stupid!" was all she said as you rubbed right where your shot was
>Quickly she's around the couch and sitting to your other side
>She grimaced at every dark and matted spot of your hair while she looked you over
>Your only response was a lame thumbs up, but a frown on your face quickly commanded her attention
>"Jane, I need you to ride my bike home," she's looking intently at you now but you turn to Isabelle on your left
>She too is focused on you now
>"I don't want to leave you here," you say slowly
>"Can... Can I come with you guys?" she's almost hesitant with her wording
>"Of course Isabelle," Jane cooes at her
>"You've got the spares, right Jane?" you ask her
>She gave you a nod while she stood up offering a paw Isabelle's way
>She's still hesitant, but she eventually holds up her own with Jane helping her up
>The two of them quickly bring you up as well, your crutch in arm as the three of you make your way to the door
>Jane is already outside - it’s just the two of you now
>Isabelle was standing there, unmoving and silent over her splintered door
>She glanced back into the living room simply unaware of you looking back
>She ends her gaze on you silently slouching there in the middle of the room
>She was quiet when she stepped out the door
>You followed to the sound of the birds chirping from the first light of the morning
 
 
>You are dozing in and out on the ride back with Isabelle behind the wheel
>It's peaceful with the lack of cars around you
>You were sitting in your seat when your eyes felt especially tired and blinked back the strain of the night
>Your eyes opened to a padded hand shaking you gently
>"Come on Anon, let's get you inside"
>You stumble out into the waiting arms of your neighbor, an owl
>"Hey, easy there, come on now let's get you inside," he says offering an arm to lean on
>You're too out of it to feel surprised and the help feels nice
>With great effort to get up the stairs and through your bioprint door he's eventually setting you down into your recliner
>"Thanks sir, sorry for being a hassle," you say sinking down into the chair
>"No, no, after hearing about all you've done how could we not help when you need it?"
>You gave another "thanks" as he takes his leave
>Stopping next to Isabelle, he turns to her with a stern gaze to her
>"Take care of him, he's one of the few humans who care about us"
>Isabelle giving a quick nod and stepping out of the way lightens his features back
>"Take care!" he calls with the door sliding behind him
>You blink again
>And you awake again, this time to the sound of Jane holding a glass of water and a pill in her hand
>"Take this Anon," she says in an almost motherly tone
>You pop it back with a gulp of water
>"Was the ride back alright?" you ask between sips
>"Like a dream," she purred giving you a soft hug and a kiss
>Your barely conscious mind brought up images of her sexy ass on it
>You started coming up with plans to get her to pose with it
>She's giggling at your goofy smile cracking out
>"What?" she asks
>"Mmnothing," boy where you losing it
>She gives you another kiss, this one deeper than the last
>"Good job Anon," she purrs again
>You smile again
>You hear a door open behind you
>Isabelle in Jane's clothing steps out from your bathroom leaving the fan and the lights on
>The steam trailing behind her made you incredibly aware with how disgusting you felt
>Jane beats you to it, giving you a little smirk of recognition
>"I know, I know," you start, "I want one to"
>The shower process is hard and Jane helps as much as she can
>Finally feeling warm and clean you now remember your current sleeping situation
 
 
>"You and Isabelle can take the bed. I'm fine with the chair," you say
>Isabelle was leaning on a wall in one of Jane's undergarments
>Seeing the first woman you met out of prison wearing the clothes of your dream gal made you wish you weren't a cripple right now
>She fills it nicely with her recently fluffed fur and her pink hair clipped to the side
>You also see her incredibly exhausted, the bags under her bright pink eyes telling a story that shouldn't have happened
>"...I'm fine with the chair, actually," she says stepping towards it
>She's quickly caught up in a tiger hug
>"No, we're all together tonight. You've been through too much," Jane was holding her close
>Isabelle offered little resistance, silently accepting it with a light returned hug while Jane led her towards your bed
>Letting go, she set the little black furred wolf down, offering a claw your way
>You made your way to the other side and slowly lowered yourself down on it, Jane crawling in to your side
>In a way, this was a dream come true
>Two beautiful women who both played an important role in your life were to your sides
>Normally in a time like this, you couldn't deny you would have a diamond hard boner
>But not today
>You knew deep down Isabelle hadn't had come out of her shell, all of yours and Jane's light teasing easily flustering her
>It didn't stop you from wondering as you lied there, eyes wide open and looking out into the dark
>A soft purring sounded out in the silence close to your head
>Small little snores in the distance followed along
>You drifted off to sleep from the warm fur around you

Chapter 20: Regain Control
>You awake to the unusual sound of sputtering steam behind you
>Your body and augs were noticeably hot, stiff and sore all over
>It wasn't from the two peacefully snoozing bodies next to you
>Blinking back sleep to start your day, you began by trying to stretch the aches away
>Your legs, still working thankfully, gave quick pops of relief when you stretched out the joints
>Your neck like a rock slowly loosened up as well finally leaving your arms and hands
>The left one slips out from under the covers easily
>The right one seemed a bit occupied in its near dead state from its newest job serving as Isabelle's pillow
>Seeing her content after that night made it all worth it
>She's splayed out on her back and drooling, her shirt half off and rising with each little snore
>A quick wiggle from your fingers gets her to shift to her side, squishing them down as well
>With your one free arm you tried to flex it out through the unusual stiffness you were feeling today
>It locked up during one of your routine shoulder rolls
>Seeing it stuck in midair suggested that yes, you definitely over did it yesterday
>With a suppressed swear you forced it back down next to a still sleeping Jane
>She was facing you, with a pleasant purr slipping past a faint smile from whatever dream she was having
>Isabelle gave a small kick to that, her long tongue now lost in her frazzled pink hair
>Overall, a perfect morning
>Though you were a bit more hesitant to leave
>You were apparently having a bad run with mornings like these
>You thought it was morning anyways, the past few hours had really fucked with your schedule lately
>The furious call of nature was a pretty good motivator though
>After an agonizing few minutes of removing your arm from under her head you were finally starting your day
>That sputtering sound never left you with every movement you made
>When one of the vents out right died mid hand washing, you swore at the fact that you needed to visit the 'mechanics'
>...As much as you liked them and how professional they claimed to be, visits to Mark and Katrina were never pleasant
>A pill from that medic, an extra-large plate of eggs over bacon and a quick boot from your PC had successfully blocked the thought of them out
>Your usual hangout threads were once up in flames about you
>You apparently made the news
>Again
>'Ex-con Saves Parole Officer from Tribals,' being the biggest headline
>You hoped your computer didn't die from the incredible amount of autism
>You weren't shitposting for long before you heard someone stirring in the bedroom
>A groggy Isabelle wandered out, and with uncertain steps she slumped on down in the recliner next to you
>"Hey 'non, got coffee?" she slurred
>You recall Jane's method of making coffee and got to it
>Returning with two mugs in hand you see Isabelle in no shape to drink it, already back to snoring loudly
>You can't help but chuckle at her as you made your way back for another for Jane
>Eventually Jane walked out with a loud yawn
>Frazzled looking and beautiful as ever, she made her self-known pressed to your side
>"Mmmm, cofffffee Anon?" she mumbled through your shirt
>"Mhm, Isabelle wanted some to"
>"Where's she hiding?"
>You pointed to the mass of fur happily snoozing away in your chair
>She gave another kick when you did
>Focusing back on the dispenser, a small spasm shot through your arm hitting multiple keys at once
>"Anon? What was that? Are you ok?" Jane obviously saw it
>Her muzzle was painted with a look of pure concern while you fought with your arm to work again
>"I overdid it with my Augs yesterday... got to get Mark and Kat to look them over today"
>She frowned at that
>"I don't like them, they give me the creeps Anon"
>"Yeah but they are the best BioMechanics this side of the Ring"
>Your only working vent seemed to agree while the other burnt black one continued to sit there
>Definitely not normal at all
>Your first day on the job after vacation and you already had to call in sick
>You dialed up your boss Steven only to have Shaxx answer
>"AHH TITAN! BACK IN THE NEWS AGAIN I SEE!"
>You could almost feel a hearty slap land on the side of your back over the roaring laughter that followed
>A yip, a thud, and a loud "Wazzafuk!?" brought all three eyes to the now fully awake Isabelle
>"Yeah," you nod to the one horned bull, "The Tribals were after my parole officer and I couldn't just stand by. Where's Steven by the way?"
>He claps
>"Fuck those Tribals! They'll get what’s coming!" he follows with a quick punch, "As for Steven, he's on vacation so I'm standing in"
>"What about Theo?" you say as a giggling Jane helps an even more frazzled Isabelle off the floor
>"He prefers to be out there, much more than I do I suppose. Besides! This gives me time to review your boxing more!"
>You feel your brain has suffered enough
>"Oh, I'm not coming in tonight Shaxx, my Augs are on the fritz so I need to see my mechanics"
>"I see - can't say I'm surprised after all. You didn't see one after the robbery, it’s no problem"
>"Thanks Shaxx"
>His hologram winks out with a nod from him
>Following the smell of coffee, Isabelle poured herself a cup
>A sip has her wretch for a moment, and she takes another drink when she's done
>"We need to get a coffee machine, huh?"
>"Yeah I think so," you felt Jane around you with a quick hug and a kiss
>When the two of you let go Isabelle's back in the recliner and forcing down her coffee
>She certainly isn't a morning person with how she's curled up and laying back in it
>A padded paw touches your arm
>"Will you be alright riding your bike there and back? Last time you couldn't even walk"
>You hate that look of concern in her eyes growing worse with every twitch in your arms and fingers
>"I'll need to use your car again, are you working?"
>She bites her lip
>"I have a show yeah... I'll take the bike, but will you be ok alone?"
>"I'll go with him"
>Isabelle was apparently awake and present in the land of the living
>"You sure Isabelle? It'll be a long process probably" you say to her slumped form by the counter
>She looks annoyed at you
>"You think I can't spare a few hours for my savior?" she rubbed an eye, "'n besides, I can do some paperwork while whatever goes on"
>You managed a half shrug
>"Fair enough"
 
 
>Jane starts getting ready for work while you slip on some real clothes
>You found a clean enough pair of jeans but decided to leave the tank top on in the small hopes that your vents air out
>Isabelle borrows some more of Jane's clothes, deciding on a pair of sweatpants and sweatshirt, no bra at all
>"What? Not like I need to impress anyone," she says as you eyed her down
>Jane is dressed similar to you and by her side was a bag that must have carried her outfit
>"Love you Anon"
>"Love you too Jane," you give her a kiss
>Slipping on a jacket she was out the door
>Isabelle was silent behind you, and turning around you caught a flick of her ears perking up
>You would say that you thought it was your imagination, but...
>No matter, you were still surprised she was even in your room at all from last night
>She must have thought she didn't have a choice, you reasoned while forcing a smile
>"Ready Isabelle?"
>"Yeah. Let's go"
>You head down to the FloCar with a little unease
>The staircase was a bit of a challenge and so was the effort needed to open the door
>The two of you were sitting down eventually while you punched in the directions, and Isabelle sat close to the window while fiddling with papers on her Holophone
>No doubt it's from yesterday
>You still couldn't believe that the parole board would send fucking Tribals to an Anthro parole officer
>The thought made you furious that this legitimate honest to god autism existed
>A small spasm in your neck told you to calm down
>You couldn't drive, didn't want too even - and Isabelle never offered
>So the two of you sat there in silence while and drove along the route
>It's awkward at best with Isabelle refusing to make eye contact or even acknowledge you
>You busied yourself looking out the window at the city and its fog
>It felt like life kept kicking at you each and every time you broke off one of its toes
>Maybe you had to keep breaking them until you had it by the balls
>A quick tear at them too if it decided to get worse
>Wouldn't that be something...?
>These thoughts and more bounced around your head to the sound of passing cars and the light tapping of her claws
 
 
>It has been quite a while since you've been here, and looking back on it now you can’t feel surprised at Jane's distrust of the place
>You found yourself at a warehouse on the outskirts of a city near one of the lower end space ports
>The place (at least officially) hadn't been used by the government in years
>You finally felt contact pressed into you
>"Yeauuhh, Anon, where are we?" forgetting her whatever it was with you, she scooched even closer
>"Mark's place," you say unclipping your belt and opening the door
>"Oh," she's a little slow in doing the same
>Eventually you're across the pavement and in a foyer with Isabelle in tow
>A small bell dings and you’re greeted by a rat with two cybernetic eyes
>"Ahhh Titan, how nice to see you again," she says in a barely contained heavy Russian accent
>Her 'eyes' up at Isabelle behind you
>"And you bring us guests, how fun~"
>You shift your weight a bit to the right at the sound of Isabelle's shuffling pads
>Smiling, her eyes get to work focusing on different parts of your body
>"Hi Kat, Mark in? I need a refit on my Augs"
>Giving a "Hmmnf," the rat looks you up and down, clicks from the filters over her eyes audible while she's fiddling with her tail
>A final click and she stares straight at you
>"You may need more than refit Titan, some of the nanoweaves are completely torn"
>You grimace
>at this point it’s a given, there will be pain
>"Follow me," she turns with a flick of her tail
>You can feel Isabelle's nails start to dig into your arm the further you go in
>As with Jane, you don't blame her either, especially when every spasm and shake of your arm gets her to hold it tighter
>This poor, sheltered girl doesn't deserve to be here for this
>She shouldn't have learned the lessons she had
>You hope that your repairs to your tools of destruction doesn't add to them
>The three of you enter a cluttered room with a large table in the center, various electronics and monitors littered the walls and the floor
>A shaking timid looking raccoon with large magnifying goggles peers out from behind a wall
>"A-ah T-Titan, h-how good to s-s-see you," he stammered out
>He's slow to leave his spot from behind the wall, but when he does you see he's made a few upgrades
>Being a short fellow, his new slightly elongated cybernetic arms were a no brainer with the only questionably looking design choice being the spindly fingers looking longer than they should be
>Even from his height, he could 'reach' you with ease if he tried
>"Hey Mark - been awhile," you put out a hand as he approaches you
>He stops briefly, with a glance towards Isabelle making a little more effort to hide behind you
>You raised an eyebrow at his continued staring, and shaking his head to clear his thoughts he closed the gap between you
>"Ahh no handshakes... d-delicate fingers," he says tapping his own together
>"N-no offense T-Titan" he says seeing your frown
>Kat is to his side holding a holopad, assumedly with your readouts on it judging from the multiple red zones on the human on it
>It was slightly worrying that your shoulders in particular were a solid black
>"Y-you've been a b-busy m-man lately," he finally says
>He taps a panel on one of his arms, dozens of screens appearing in front of him of the various things you've done
>To your side, the you saw the movement of Isabelle's ears going wild after every single one: straight up in shock from your jump, tilted back from your view of her captured, and finally straight down with her looking at the floor from the stream you and Jane held concluding
>You added it to the things you suppressed, the other being Mark busying himself with the table
>You didn't see Kat go to your other side, but you felt her paw rubbing down your back
>"Very good show Titan," she said with heavy honeyed words just below your ear
>"W-we c-could recognize those v-vents a m-mile away"
>Those things were becoming a liability, your height no longer your defining feature
>The only one working sputtered again from the heat that stood in your body
>"Can we get on with this, please?" you shift your back away from the Rat's paw, Isabelle no longer holding you either
>"A-ah, y-yes," he clicked a button and the table's multiple parts shifted into a chair
>One final glance showed a skeptical Isabelle tinged with worry standing next to a pouting Katrina, the clipboard in hand being held to a little tighter
>"It's fine, all clean and sanitary," you say beginning to step into the chair, "ultraviolet laser grids or something," you finish sitting somewhat comfortably
>The moment you're secure, straps snap around your waist, knees, elbows and wrists with a final one over your chest
>"HEY!"
>Isabelle rushed forward, "what’s goi-"
>"Isabelle STOP," you command
>She does, staring at you
>"If I wanted too I could break these apart in an instant," you say to her slowly
>"...This is going to be a long and painful process, and these are to restrict my movement," you continue with her looking on in horror
>"This is for mine and their safety - trust me and trust them, they are professionals"
>That all too common depressed look of hers, hung head and ears down with a slightly curled tail appeared when you finished
>You never knew her to be this unhappy this often
>Fuck, you wished you could stop it
>"I understand Anon, and I'm sorry. I'm just... still jumpy from yesterday"
>You hated the mob you thought you killed off just a little bit more
>All she saw was your nod
>In the silence that followed Mark tapped another few keys and a large screen appeared showing the readout on your Augs
>The ones in your legs are shorted and need replacement - another jump like the last one and you wouldn't survive it
>Your arms needed replacement from all the fried connections that constantly misfired in order to stop the shakes and freezes
>The crack in your skull needed a new nano density layer in both spots where the crowbar had hit you
>Your ribs were fine for the most part, but you assumed Mark didn't want to risk it with them too slotted for repairs
>And finally, your ports had to be cleaned and refitted for the heat damage that caused it all in the first place
>The only one in the green was the stamina Aug that loosely covered your lungs
>You were glad Jane wasn't here to see this, as Isabelle's looks told you all you'd need to know
>"R-right then let’s get to w-work"
>Something dull was projected over you that had a small numbing effect
>While you still could, you looked to her
>"Isabelle, you should wait outside"
>"Sorry dear," Katrina was to her side an arm around her back, "no guards on duty to watch you, but there's a chair here for you over there," her hand wave was as stiff as her smile
>You didn't have time to glare as Mark's scalpel had already began to dig out the vents
>"It won't be long Titan," said Kat with your replacements in her arms
>You promised you wouldn't yell or thrash or swear
>For Isabelle
 
 
>Several hours had passed, and in your tired mind the sun itself felt like it burned at your skin
>Multiple lasers closed your incisions shut while your drenched clothes did little to sooth it
>You were glad that through the pain Katrina eventually relented, and allowed Isabelle to leave the room
>In your addled state you lightly laughed at the thought that she probably didn't want to see a man cut open and sewn shut repeatedly
>You were barely aware when it was over as you sat in the wheelchair Mark had provided
>"R-remember, no ss-straining o-or heavy l-lifting," he said to Isabelle while the three of you waited outside by the FloCar
>"H-he w-won’t be able t-to move very w-well on his o-own," you heard him say around her almost numbing paws easing you into the seat
>You couldn't feel much of anything at the moment
>She gets in beside you, this time on the driver's side
>After a moment she looks to you, paw hovering over the dash with the coordinates home already punched in
>"Ready to go Anon?"
>You nod, and the car begins its trip back home
>Your slumped in your seat barely awake
>Surprisingly being cut open can be quite exhausting
>Still, Isabelle seems more attentive to you than the ride over with her constant glances at every one of your tired groans
>"Can you walk? Are you able to move your arms?" she would ask
>You responded to each of them with patience
>You knew this was something she's never seen before
>Another lesson was added to the list...
>When you get home, she strains to get you on your feet
>After great effort you're standing, doing your best to not crush her small struggling frame
>You can walk and move, but barely
>Stiffness invaded every joint of your body and it was especially felt on the walk up the stairs
>It didn't matter
>You could still move them, and so you did
>All the way up to your living room recliner that she relaxed you in, a tired smile from both of you showing
>"Thanks Izzy, you're a great parole officer"
>You catch her bite her lip as she shuffles uncomfortably
>"I'm, uhh, not your parole officer anymore," you blink at her
>"Wha-"
>"No one is," she starts again, "You're officially off parole!"
>"Uh - surprise!" she gave a small awkward cheer
>You blinked again
>...
>"Nani?!" you thought
>Her surprised expression told otherwise, but she quickly went back to her lip biting
>"While you were in 'surgery' I made some calls and explained what you did: The robbery, the donations to your orphanage," she took a breath, "...saving me," it was quiet for that one
>You simply closed your eyes, you taking your own deep breath and relaxing into your chair
>It was a lot to think about
>Your thoughts were interrupted from a paw touching your hand
>You were too tired to open your eyes though
>"H-hey, Anon?" there was hesitation in her voice
>She paused at whatever she wanted to say
>"Can you do something for me?" she finally gets out
>"Hmmm wazzat Isabelle?"
>You're very tired, the sensation of sleep keeping your heavy lids shut tight
>The padded paw fell off yours
>"Open your eyes please"
>You return from the brink, rubbing your eyes open muttering a "what?"
>Topless
>You quickly close your eyes
>"Hey uh Isabelle - your shirt's gone"
>You felt her paws on your legs
>"I know Anon, please look at me"
>You shake your head
>nope Nope NOPE
>She rubbing her paws on the sides of your legs now
>"You don't want a guy like me Isabelle, seriously, there are plenty of better guys out there"
>Something soft that easily gives pushes into your legs with soft little nubs felt on either side
>You struggle to think about anything other than the large wolf breasts being pushed against you
>"No, I think I want you Anon," she cooed at you while you felt her paws sneaking up your waistline
>You try to move her off, her slow gliding paws traveling up your arms
>They sat there unmoving, as hard and heavy as iron while hers flowed over them cool as water
>You can't get her off you
>As much as you try to will the movement she simply brushes them aside
>You try a different method
>"ISABELLE STOP!" you plead
>She paused
>"This isn't right! I'm with Jane and you're just infatuated with me! You don't know me, not really!" you start
>She's holding on to your arms even tighter but you continue on
>"Stop, please, just think about it - Jane's your best friend! If not for me than think of how she'd feel!"
>You hear an angry huff in response, her grip tight and holding your useless arms down
>"My best friend who sent me a link to the stream you and her were in!"
>Oh fuck
>"She what?"
>You still can’t move
>"She gave me all her social media! INCLUDING HER PORN ONE!" her grip is almost painful over the hidden fresh seams in your skin
>"She leaves with you that night while all I get is an update to her stream! A stream where she gets to have you all to herself!?"
>You feel her weight start to sit in your chair
>She brings her head to rest on yours - so close to where her shining, desperate pink eyes are all you can see
>"I want that Anon! I want you!"
>Your whole body is useless
>It's failed you so much lately
>"No no no this isn't right, just stop so we can talk to Jane!"
>You got a twitch that was quickly slapped away
>She's pushing all of herself into your lap and up your torso
>"Kiss me Anon, please"
>Lead fills your veins to coat the iron in your bones
>Nothing responds no matter how hard you try to will them
>She notices your locked lips, but she doesn't give up
>You feel her start kissing up your neck
>Finally some relief!
>But she smothers that too with her chest firmly set on your face
>"Please!"
>A new sensation fills your body
>Its pain from the fall the two of you had, with her on you and your recliner on it's side
>It could only take so much weight before it would eventually spill over
>Your eyes were clenched shut the small waves radiating through you
>It was especially bad in the razor thin cut lines that dotted your body
>"Mmm?" a new voice cuts through your groans
>You crack open an eye to see two golden feet just outside your bedroom doorway
>You shot both open on the Jane's leaning figure barely contained in a tight tank top and small short shorts
>"Jane! I'm sorry help me please!" you entered full panic mode
>She stood there looking between you and Isabelle, just as stunned as you and laying frozen across your chest
>"So this is what you wanted, huh," she finally said
>You felt yourself starting to drown as her dark blue eyes pierced your soul
>She turned her gaze to Isabelle
>"After all this time you finally admitted what you want"
>Isabelle's breath caught in her throat as you struggled to sit upright
>The need to hug Jane and tell her you didn't ask for this
>"And so did you, Anon," her eyes unblinking
>Wait, what?
>"Jane, what?" you managed to choke out
>Isabelle had finally left you and your struggling to stand grew even more desperate
>God, is this what it's like to be old? Fuck that noise
>Jane finally, slowly makes her way to you and with a tight grip manages to ease you into your other chair
>You can hear Isabelle crying as Jane went to flip over the other
>She moved out of sight and you tried to follow, but the stiffness never left you as you sag there
>The weight of the surgery, or the fact that you failed her - you couldn't decide what kept you there
>The crying slows to little hiccups with the soft noise of purring over each one
>Soft murmurs finally get them to stop entirely
>What was Jane doing?
>Consoling her?
>"Whats going on?" your voice cracked from the words
>The two become silent
>"I can't fucking move and I'm CONFUSED AS FUCK!" you yelled out after
>"Anon you oblivious idiot, Isabelle has had feelings for you for a long time now," you hear Jane behind you
>The subtle shifting sound of fur over fur sent your slowed confused gears to a dangerous new speed
>When the sound of kissing behind joined in on the fun you shifted them to maximum overdrive
>"That's great and all," a little louder and panic in your voice, "but I'm with YOU Jane! I can't do anything like that, I told her!"
>After your rant you heard paw steps getting closer to you
>"I know Anon I heard, you tried your hardest to keep her off you and I'm proud of you for that" You catch Jane at your side as she cooed to you
>A lewd grin spread over her muzzle
>"But I wanna see what the big bad wolf will do to you if given the chance"
>You were too distracted to notice Isabelle reluctantly stand before you as Jane held your full attention
>A fang poked over her lips, biting down on them softly as her hand trailed down your chest
>You finally notice the Isabelle nervously rubbing her paws, her ears hidden behind her stark pink hair and still topless
>Jane's paw having finally reached your leg, her other grabs onto Isabelle's and pulls her sitting down on the floor
>"Jane, what's going on?"
>You can practically feel the purring travel through her hand that she now has on your knee
>"It's like I said~" she uses her other to pull Isabelle close, her eyes on yours as Isabelle tries to shy away
>She's rubbing her hand up and down Isabelle's fur; the golden fur of Jane's now resting head a stark contrast to the dark fluff of Isabelle's neck
>It's too much when she looks at you like that!
>Another rub on your knee and Isabelle's arm
>"I want to see how the big bad wolf will ravish the human that can't fight back" she repeats with a seductive smile
>Her purrs can out-sound jets with how they reverb around your living room
>Emboldened by Jane's sugared words, Isabelle began undoing your pants
>"Wait wait wait!" you said before it got any farther
>She didn't stop
>"You WANT her to do this Jane? Why?" you're wide eyed, confused to all hell, a little scared, and a little aroused by your traitorous other head
>Jane slid up and kissed you, her lips on yours keeping your quiet
>"Because it will be fun!" she broke off, "And I know Isabelle has been wanting you~" it felt odd to be pet by your girlfriend, "you just can't tell with that small little nose of yours"
>She gave yours a tap and a rub on her own
>Isabelle's ears tried to hide again while she kneeled before you
>From this angle her glorious bust was on full display
>"OH OH OH WAIT," Jane bounced off excitedly leaving the two of stunned
>Isabelle still had her paws over your crotch though
>...Hnng...
>A moment later Jane returned throwing a mask to your face
>It slid off it and settled somewhere on your shoulder
>She was careful with her toss to Isabelle, who caught it after a startled few grabs and looking dumbfounded all the while
>"This is too good to pass up!" said Jane, practically bouncing in place, "I got more cameras too!"
>"You wanted to stream us taking advantage of Anon?" Isabelle's confusion starting to match yours
>"I've never done this before!"
>Jane had a twinkle in her eye as she hungrily looked you over
>"All the more fun," she finally said
 
 
>The two of you awkwardly sat there, with you near blinded by the mask on your head and watching Jane go about putting things in place
>She had various social media sites pulled up on your comp announcing the stream
>In the software itself you caught multiple angles of your near lifeless self with an equally frozen black and pink wolf to your side still holding her mask
>Jane even went the distance and placed you sitting like a king on his throne
>A small camera sat on your head, a crown set to finish the look
>"So the viewers can pick any angle they want to see!" being her only explanation
>It's been a long time since you were able to move
>It's a little worrisome at this point
>Even if you wanted too, you couldn't take off the mask
>And just as before, her chatroom was flooded with people
>A thought came to your mind
>It's one you've already asked before
>"Jane how long have you been planning this?" asked Isabelle, still holding her mask in shock
>"Ever since I smelled your lust for Anon~" Jane replied with her ass stuck out and her body bent forward same as before
>She gave a small shake at that
>"And especially since it was even stronger after he saved you," she was finished with the cameras and a gave one final shake standing up
>You can't complain at the concept of streaming this anymore
>"If only you knew how strong it was the moment she slipped in your bed," she had a paw covering her mouth to hold back the laughing she had
>A small part of you had already accepted this being another small part in your greatly redefined concept of a relationship
>The rest of you backpedaled though
>In fact, you’re at a loss for words
>Isabelle, the sheltered anime and video game loving wolf loved your display of violence?
>...
>Well, now that you think about it, that makes perfect sense
>A predatory male showing off strength taking down the weaker ones
>Her shows could get pretty violent, too
>She was so flustered and scared though, you didn't think she even knew about it
>It must have been a totally subconscious reaction for her
>Isabelle kneeling before you brought you back from your thoughts
>She was holding the mask in her paws, still looking at it with an expression you couldn't quite see
>You don't know what debate she's having inside of herself, but it looked to be serious enough from the frown and the smile that switches on her
>You accept it
>"Put it on," you whisper to her
>She jumped slightly at your words with a careful look up at you
>"You sure? I mean, even with Jane?" it was almost hopeful
>Nervous, but happy
>You hear a light hum from Jane as she works, a slight swish of her tail as she obviously listened in
>"She's basically begging you to do this to me. Don't want to disappoint her, right?"
>The smile finally dominates her muzzle
>"No, we don't"
 
>Jane is looking your way expectantly, your monitors full of various sites confirming the show was ready to start, and in either paw held her skimpy blue mesh outfit, with a slightly larger in pink
>Oh yes, she was prepared alright
>A large toothy grin is on her muzzle as well while Isabelle snapped the mask on
>You were focused on her until Jane came around to her side - she had already put on her 'outfit' and gave the small pink one a little shake
>"C'mon, it’ll be great!" she encouraged Isabelle
>Another moment later and the pink mesh outfit was soon filled out by the increasingly embarrassed puffball
>Jane looked great, but the sight of Isabelle's fur on her chest pushing forcing its way out through the lining
>...Well, at least one part of you could move
>Your view was quickly replaced by warm tiger fur when Jane sat on your lap
>After a quick tug on Isabelle's paw brought her along too
>The two of them settle in with Jane putting in the extra effort to give your groin the occasional light grind with the same damn teasing routine as last time
>When Isabelle herself had finally calmed down somewhat, Jane grabbed a remote from her side and had an arm around Isabelle keeping her in place
>"Let's get this show started then," she says with a remote in hand
>You stared out to the monitor that held the main feed
>A very large masked man, an eager tiger in his lap and a shy masked wolf in hers looked back
>A click from the remote and the stream is live
>"Hey guys and gals, Janet Diamond Here with my Girlfriend Izzy with a veeerrryyyy special event planned our Boyfriend here" Jane says with a sultry seductive voice
>She has her arms around Isabelle, kept under and holding up her large fluffy mounds
>The monitor couldn't do it justice, each motion threatening to burst through the canvas
>"Our poor boyfriend had his Augs rebuilt and can't really move right, the poor poor human. The Big Bad Wolf is gonna eat him right up!"
>Isabelle kept squirming in Jane's grasp the more she played her chest
>The chat was loving it, but most of them demanded Jane to join in on the fun
>"Oh~? Are you suurree?" a yip from a wandering paw to Isabelle's nip and an almost predatory grin from Jane was all they got
>Multiple "HOLY SHIT YES," "KeEP PLAYING HER," "GROPE THE DOGGO, DO IT NOW" flooded down the list
>A comment with a star froze the chat momentarily, reading "some handholding, pls"
>"How naughty!" Jane gave a mock gasp and slid her padded fingers into Isabelle's
>"But how can I say no?" Isabelle gave a kick from the other moving down her stomach fur
>When the chat resumed, so did the autism - but none of it stopped the scene before you
>Isabelle had to endure the cuddling
>"Now as lewd as that was, I'm sure there's much, much more you want us to do," both paws interlocked with Isabelle with both sets of arms held under her breasts
>With a flash from hand a zipper was pulled, and from the other it grabbed on the ill-fitting pink top and threw it to the side
>"Look at these big gorgeous tits everyone!" Jane had her hands on them once again with a bit more energy in playing with them
>"Izzy here has been hiding these from our boyfriend!" yips and squeaks kept coming from the two furred bodies who you could only experience through a tiny desktop window
>You're lucky you can't move still, for if you could your chair's arm rests wouldn't survive it
>The movements on your lap stopped with a strong purr and light panting in the silence
>She was fully leaning on Isabelle, propping her forward with her breasts and their heads filling the screen
>"Now she's going to use them on him"
>"YEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSS!" screamed the chat
>'Finally!' screamed your thoughts as the pressure was finally getting to you
>You're already crazy diamond hard, a little polish would have it shining and everything at this point
>It's still annoying to see that the chat doesn't believe it’s all you down there, though
>It's still great to know that they're all just buttmad jealous
>Jane never took off her outfit yet, but with the two of them on the floor the view was just as amazing
>The pink on black contrast of Isabelle may be gone, but the rest of her - re-sequenced hair color and all...
>God, she was beautiful
>Just as much as Jane
>Deep inside in some primal place, the thought that these two amazing women were there just for you...
>You focused back on Jane and Isabelle who now knelt before you
>Jane with her guiding paws led the wolf's glorious tits around your swollen erection
>"Come on Izzy, show everyone what a big bad wolf you can be," Jane whispered
>Her seductive voice and gentle prompts seemed to give Isabelle more courage to feel her fur start to move on your skin
>That tigress's voice alone could turn a gay man straight
>Your member was engulfed in her large fluffy pillows and her muzzle gave short hot breaths inches away from your head
>"A-am I doing this right?" she whispered to Jane
>She got a deep kiss as her answer
>Breaking off and a paw to her back, she also leaned close with a wide smile back
>"Mhm you're doing great Izzy, just like that"
>Isabelle looked back her chest with your dick poking out, the head barely escaping its soft, ticklish prison
>A grin fought with muzzle as she could decide to be giddy or determined
>With a mixture of both and her own two paws she pressed her breasts together
>Her silken fur felt like a dream from the constant smooth pressure and warmth
>It got even better when she began moving her tits up and down your shaft
>You had been thinking about them for awhile now, they were bigger than Jane's but still pretty perky
>You relaxed from the feeling of your arms and legs sleeping
>A calming white noise drifted through your limbs only stopped from that amazing feeling down below
>What Isabelle lacked in technique she quickly made up for in sheer eagerness
>She certainly found her fire after
>Vigorous up and down motions, gentle licks with her long tongue, her hot breaths from her pants on your member
>Jane guided her rhythm with her arms around Isabelle's and a light grasp to help apply pressure
>Heaven couldn't tell you that it was better than this from her giant breasts rubbing you and down
>You'd punch god if he tried, and thank him after
>You closed your eyes and focused on the feeling
>It only got even better when a raspy soft tongue joined in with the long wet one focused on your tip
>You wished you could move and help with the whole thing right now
>But you're along for this ride; a passenger of the sensation train
>You can feel Isabelle and Jane kissing over the head of your increasingly engorged member
>"Just keep going like that Love" Jane said and the wonderful sultry voice of hers
>Her whispers traveled up your chest and gentle kissing and licking trailed with them
>"Poor little boyfriend, the big bad wolf is gonna gobble you up~"
>She's kissing up your neck with a small bite or two on the side
>When she's done, you're lost in her eyes - still as deep a blue as the Terran sea
>She closes them and moves for a kiss
>Its quick as you lose yourself into it
>You didn't think it was another part of her show this time
>As fast as it was it was gone the next moment, and she sultry fang marked smile while she traveled back down to Isabelle
>Your member is twitching hard from Isabelle's relentless assault
>The fur around you is pushed away and you opened your eyes to see why
>"Open wide, use your tongue," and with a paw on the back of Isabelle's head she slowly lowered it down
>Isabelle had her mouth open when her cold nose booped your dick and with a little more effort she slowly swallowed it down
>It was understandably warm and wet, and you felt the occasional fang lightly graze you
>Hot breaths fell on your groin while she struggled to take it all in
>At a little more than halfway she coughed and gagged slightly
>"Oooooh? It seems the human is too much for our wolf~" Jane said with delight
>"You're doing great Izzy," this whisper just for her, "keep it up"
>Isabelle's tongue wrapped around you licking up and down your shaft while she caught her breath
>"This big bad wolf is just going to have to try harder~" Isabelle cooed
>She's getting into it finally, the momentary surprise on Jane's face quickly replaced with that same lust filled grin
>"Mmm, I want some too," she says joining in on your side with little licks on your parts still exposed
>"Let me show you how it's done," with her moving a panting Isabelle off of you
>She took her place, and with ease she even took you all the way down to your base
>To not feel left out Isabelle took to kissing your inner thighs as Jane slowly bobbed up and down your shaft
>Cloud 9, achieved - but you still held on to not ruin the fun
>Jane's head moved faster with her soft raspy tongue coiled around your cock
>Isabelle was staring in awe at the sight
>"I want to try again~" she moved in closer
>"Mmm~?"
>Jane released you from her mouth with a wet 'pop' and ran a finger across her mouth
>"Let's see what you can do"
>She pulled Isabelle into a kiss, their tongues pushing back and forth on each other
>You glanced back at the monitor
>At some point, the view changed from the camera on your head with the chat flying by with unreadable speeds
>The sight of Jane and Isabelle breaking the kiss with a thin line of saliva connecting the two brought your eyes back down to the show
>Without speaking Isabelle had a paw on your shaft and starting to give it more kisses
>After everything you've endured, the few gentle licks, hot breath, and soft rubbing paws were completely overwhelming you
>Without waiting a moment her mouth was back around your shaft, locking it in with her velvety lips
>She started pushing down further with each steady motion with Jane's whispered words of sultry encouragement leading her on
>Each push further causes her throat to clench around your shaft
>Not an inch was spared from her tongue while it wrapped and caressed every part of you
>It's too much
>"I-I’m gonna c-cum Izzy," you said through clenched teeth
>Isabelle started to rise off your cock but Jane pushes her back down
>"Big bad wolf has to drink it alll down"
>A slight whimper escaped Isabelle before she started moving her mouth up and down again
>You would have helped guide her rhythm if you could as her own began getting frantic
>No experience whatsoever, but her sheer eagerness coming forth told you just how much she truly wanted it
>"H-here it c-comes Izzy!"
>You erupt into a coughing black muzzle, your white seed painting it inside and out and only kept down with a reassuring paw
>Jane finally let her up again with more coughs and a whimpering wheeze
>She didn't have long to breath as Jane pulled her back into another deep kiss
>You could hear Isabelle moaning into Jane's mouth who simply purred in response
>It wasn't over yet for you when the two broke off
>Jane looked at the nearest camera, "mmm, I wanted some too~"
>You caught Isabelle panting and squirming as she stared at your still hard cock
>"Ooo, someone wants the real deal~" Jane came back into view
>Isabelle looked up at you questioningly
>"C-can I?" she begged
>"Do it Izzy," you reassured her
>She's slow to stand
>With every new experience she's had so far it was only after a few words of encouragement before she would break from her shell
>And with the way you are currently it was Jane who once again took charge leading Isabelle to your lap
>"Sit on his lap first, show everyone how big that human cock is compared to you~" that purr never leaving her voice
>You caught her paws clenched nervously to her chest on one of the camera feeds
>"This is my first time," she whispered out
>"Perfect~"
>Ooooooh shit
>She took a second to get comfortable in your lap with her thighs squeezing down on you a little harder than you'd like
>You can feel her toying with the tip and only opening up when her fingers held a gap from your tip to base
>"I-I don't know if I can take it all," she whispered again bringing her outstretched hand to her stomach
>"You will Izzy, trust me," Jane had a paw at your base keeping it steady while Isabelle still moved around
>A little wet spot forming on you betrayed all hesitation in Isabelle's nervous whispers
>"Trust me, once you feel human cock in you, you won’t want anything else," was all it took
>Isabelle lifted her hips and Jane helped guide you under her now dripping slit
>"Gentle, go slow Izzy," a flick of her ear heard your whisper, "Don't hurt yourself, ok?"
>Especially in this case
>She gasped as she slowly lowered herself onto you
>She wasn't lying about never doing it from how every gasp brought her clamping down
>Another gasp came out and a long slow whine
>She was a lot more wet after that one, with a glance at the camera easily showing why
>Jane had a camera zoomed all the way in on Isabelle's dripping pussy and from the clear liquid that slowly fell out it soon turned a dull red
>"Isabelle you're a virgin? Not even with a- "
>"Yes," a pained hiss cut you off while she still slid down
>"I-I told y-you I've n-never done this before," she stammered out going farther down
>She was shivering a bit with the occasional wag of her tail
>Pleased with her camera work Jane was back to your side rubbing your shoulders
>"How is she love?~"
>"She's tight and quivering"
>"H-holy fuck this is a-amazing," giving you a sigh of relief and a small laugh out of Jane
>Her furry legs were back to yours and in the moment her body relaxed
>"Now now Izzy, you're going to have to do all the moving: our poor boyfriend here can't even fight you off while you ravage him"
>Jane gave her a tap on her side
>With shaky paws Isabelle leaned forward and grabbed on to your knees
>It was only after did she start her timid attempt at riding you
>Nothing seemed to hold her back as soon as she had started; something carnal came to life with every hilt to your base
>She was incredibly tight from the way her walls quivered and pulled at you and every time she lifted the spot she would leave would be increasingly wetter
>Jane's incessant purring never left your head that slowly filled with Isabelle's quiet whimpers of pleasure
>The room was full of her moans of ecstasy when she was outright slamming down on your pelvis
>Everything with her was all power and speed without any sense of rhythm
>She had your dick in a vice that pulled you along her incredibly slow upward thrust
>For the first time in your life you were finally scared for your tip that still speared her
>"AWHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO," she howled through your pain and crashing down hard taking you entirely
>She's soaking you hard through her shivers and shuttering through her climax on you
>Her claws let go when she fell on your chest from her body unable to support her
>"Human cock is the best isn't it Izzy~?"
>She feebly nodded back
>"My turn though~"
>Jane's paws left your shoulders to lightly lift Isabelle's
>Inch by inch she slides off of you and your reward for it all were her walls gently quivering and trying to hold on
>They were the only signs of life from her semi-conscious, floppy drooling form
>Having left her spread out at the base of the chair, it was Jane's turn now to straddle you
>"I want to face you love," and with a turn in your lap and the flash of her flying outfit she did
>She gave a twitch of her tail, and having found itself wrapped around your legs she launched her head forward and caught you in a passionate kiss
>She shifted her hips into the air, looking for you
>Your head having found her dripping nethers, she wasted no time at all lowering herself onto you
>"Ooooo that’s a good cock~"
>The time she spent teasing the two of you was all the foreplay she needed
>She doesn't didn't want to go slow from her hard rhythmic bouncing on you like a piston
>The loud purrs swam in your head while her walls also coiled and clamped down on you
>Her movement is constant, refined and careful on top of you
>Your dick could really enjoy itself now
>She steadied herself with her paws to your face, never letting up in her thrusting
>"Oooo babe I want it please fill me~!"
>You were reloaded and ready to go, but you dared not fire until Jane's had her fun
>Her sultry voice and increasingly tight grip took all of your focus
>Spotting a weakness, she stole another kiss from you
>You fought back against her tongue as best as you can
>Bless the beautiful bastard who invented your stamina augs, for a deep breath on her part and she had already lost
>She hilts you with deep pleasured growl while your already damp crotch became soaked from her orgasm
>Her thrusts didn't stop through her warm sprays and only got stronger with her chest pressed onto yours
>Her nipples to your shoulders, soft silky fur gliding over your bare chest, and that constant wonderful purring flowing through you
>You didn't get the chance to warn her as you released everything into her
>"MMM YEESSSSS," she moaned loudly with her resting form breathing hard on yours
>You heard a slight groan from the still drunken Isabelle as the three of you basked in the moment
>Jane still panting looked at the camera strapped to your head
>"Hope you all enjoyed the show," she breathed while reaching for the remote
>"See you next time~"
>*CLICK*
>The stream and everything with it shuts off
>She also peeled off your mask while Isabelle fumbled with hers
>"That was amazing babe," you gasp out
>"Both of you were amazing," Jane said back
>A slightly unsteady Isabelle is sitting on your arm chair's side, her breasts weren't supported while she was leaning above you
>She kissed you tenderly
>"I'm glad that my first time was with you Anon"
>You wanted nothing more than to hug them both
>Your Augs still refused to move
>"Let's all go to bed," you yawned out, "I could use some help though"
>Jane and Isabelle quickly agreed
>With a quick cleanup on their part and your head on a pillow, the three of you settled into bed
>Jane had your right with your arm curled around her
>Isabelle, your left with her head on your shoulder
>"Love you both," you fight back a yawn
>"I love you too," one of them said
>"Me too," said the other
>You were already fast asleep snuggled against the two soft bodies of fur

Chapter 21: Stronger
>You are Colonel Dregen, Commander of the [Ring|Assault|Infiltration|Defense] squad, publicly known as RAID
>Although human by birth, you swore you had the heart of a lion in your chest
>Bravery, sadly, is not a great substitute for manpower
>You had tasked your second in command, an Anthro Puma named LT Perun with finding you the biggest and baddest fuckers on the ring
>She had been rather quick on the job
>Or lazy, depending on the man you saw sitting in that room
>You were looking through a one way mirror at a lanky Human male who was sitting in his chair with his feet propped up on the table
>LT Perun had recently brought him in along with a pretty heavy report sheet
>It's possible you briefly glanced through the first page
>Still, she had brought what she thought you had wanted, and so you glanced back at the RAP sheet just to be sure
>Anon, AKA Titan
>Raised in an orphanage, currently working as a security guard
>Was in organized crime, is currently an undefeated boxer
>You gave a small sigh with how seriously Perun took the "biggest" requirement
>Yes, he was seven feet tall and working as a security guard, and it counted for something
>But that's hardly what you would call a bad ass
>You looked back through the mirror at the man who was currently picking at metal on his shoulder
>Alright, so he apparently had Augs too - would explain his height
>You made your way to the door
>'Titan' was looking at you in his still casual seating arrangements while you stared back
>On your face was a scowl you honed from years on the job
>One you used that made you the best at talking people down
>It tended to get especially nasty on nameless bureaucratic peons who constantly tried cutting your funding; and it was this one you had to get rid of him in the hopes of finding more real candidates
>The above however happened in the span of a few seconds
>Your inner self praise did little to save you from the calm, cold stare of his own
>The moment you had entered, his dark eyes cut through yours; the story of a thousand deaths they told burned into your very core
>You knew that if you looked away he would win, he would have the dominance in this interview
>Your struggle was hard, and even though you swore yourself a predator it was clear he was the bigger one
>A small little fox could not stand before a tiger
>"Mr. Anon?" you finally get out
>"What do you want?"
>And with that, his gruff annoyed voice cut your confidence to shreds
>Your hands started to fidget under his gaze
>How can a man look so relaxed and lazy yet still look like he could kill you without a second thought?
>"I-I'll be right back," you say leaving the room and shutting the door behind you
>It supported your weight as you leaned against it
>With a sigh of relief (and shame,) you went back to the mirror
>Never before had any man been able to intimidate you like that
>You were a combat officer on the Ring! THE RAID commander no less!
>How could a washed out gangbanger turned private security do that?!
>You shook your head and paused to collect your thoughts
>Glancing back through the mirror had Titan still on that pose of his and looking at pictures of cats on his Holophone
>...Maybe Perun could send him away
>You turned to your left and were immediately greeted by a large smug grin on Perun's Muzzle
>"Nice performance in there," she said through your yell
>Fuck she had seen it
>You had to compose yourself again
>"I asked for the biggest and baddest on the ring and all you have to show is a street thug?"
>She laughs in your face
>"I take it you didn't read the full report I put together on him then"
>She was holding the RAP sheet you were trying to get
>With a little flourish she handed it over
>"I uh, I skimmed it," you say taking it from her, "summarize it for me?"
>She sighed out her laughter and looked through the mirror at the man
>You followed her gaze to find the man now looking at cats holding tails in their mouths
>"Titan here has left a blood soaked trail throughout the ring," she started
>"While most of the reports don't have solid proof, it's clear in his time working for organized crime as their muscle it gave him a reputation for sheer brutality"
>She handed a holopad along with a mugshot of a younger angrier man
>On screen were dozens of pictures of people with their face quite literally smashed into nothing
>"None of the killings here were ever proven to be him as the mafia wanted him free to do their dirty work"
>You can't help but gaze in awe at the sheer amount of numbers presented from both pad and paper
>"Suspected homicide, suspected homicide, suspected assault with a deadly weapon, suspected homicide, suspected impersonation of a clergy member with suspected homicide..." her words trailed off the cases listed
>"If you want the baddest person on the ring, you're looking at him," she said snapping a finger beside you
>You pulled yourself away from the list
>"The Tribals called him the Dust Giant because he would crush any members he met into dust,"
>You look at her in disbelief
>"How is he not in prison?!"
>"You mean still, right?" she pointed at the mug shot, "they only kept him in there for two years before someone decided to let him go again - the official statement being 'too crowded,' of course"
>"We both know why though, given his past"
>"And now?" you ask
>"Lack of proof, prior mafia backing - the fact he only killed Tribals specifically," she was suddenly serious
>"His origin specifically gives credit to that last statement," she tapped on the pad and brought up a residential map, "I don't believe that sector had more than a few, maybe ten humans at any time"
>She tapped on it again
>"The biggest reason being his role in the UltraLux attack and his assistance in the capture of Gabriel Flinn," she said over the video of him storming the halls with an overexcited small fox on his shoulder
>"If we're going to find and take down the Tribals, we're going to need him," she finished taking the reports from your hands
>You sighed and nodded
>"Alright Perun, but you're dealing with him," you finally told her
>She smiled at that
>"He scare you that bad? The guys who brought him in nearly wet themselves when they picked him up"
>"Understandable," she continued, "a private Stevens made the mistake of directly touching him, and, a little hilariously, he would only listen to the one Anthro wolverine 1/4ths his size"
>You blinked at that
>"He's hospitalized and missing a few teeth, currently. The wolverine considers Titan to be amicable, though"
>"Right," you finally say, "I'll just, leave it to you then"
>"You got it boss"
>She gave you a wink
>You hoped that you weren't going to regret bringing in a homicidal giant into RAID
>...But maybe, he was exactly what RAID needed

>It's been some time since you had your Augs rebuilt
>Six months, to be exact
>Time flew by between boxing, work and spending time with Jane and Isabelle who you let stay with you during the repairs
>When they were done, she offered you the same, the excuse being she didn't want to be alone there anymore
>So you and Jane packed up your stuff and moved in with her
>A lot of your down time was spent in the boxing world and you were moving up in the rankings by still being undefeated
>Life was acceptable, good even - but not for the rest of the ring
>You heard a disturbing report of more tattooed faced men skulking around the Anthro slums
>Mostly in areas the various Anthro mafia groups used to run until their leader was taken out
>The Tribals were on a massive recruiting spree it seemed
>They were emboldened by the taste of success, no doubt with Isabelle's almost capture being the leading force behind it
>A lot of Anthros with "desirable" qualities were quickly going missing
>It got even worse when their tastes extended to just about any
>It was getting so bad that you walked Jane and Isabelle to their FloCars every day
>The security forces of the UltraLux were getting spread thin from personal requests of friends and neighbors begging for protection
>Eventually it didn't matter which kind or age of Anthro was taken as someone disappeared every day
>It took the threat of a full out riot breaking out on the Ring did the government finally speak out
>"We will deal with these terrorists for the good of our people," they claimed
>One day while you were sitting on the couch in the recently rebuilt house, a very loud and incessant knocking banged on the door
>You were watching the news of a riot setting fire to a sub government district before you were rudely pulled away
>You weren't too keen on using guns should people be close enough to your fists, but the sight of a shotgun trained on the people outside would usually get them to go
>Officers in uniform had about six guns pointed right back when you did
>"Sir," the closest one said, "you are a Mr... 'Titan,' correct?"
>Gun still in hand you only gave him a stiff nod
>"If it's all right with you, we'd like for you to come with us now"
>He didn't give you the chance to talk with him already making a move for your gun
>They should be thankful you at least had the decency to not have a finger on the trigger
>It didn't stop you from bashing the man in his face though
>"Pvt Stevens! You damn moron!" came a feminine voice the smallest of the bunch
>You hefted your shotgun over your shoulder while she casually stepped over the writhing officer
>After a few seconds with her fiddling with her helmet she soon peeled it off of her suit
>A fuzzy, slightly pudgy Wolverine face greeted your own when she held it to her side
>"Hey Sir, I know this sucks but could you please come with us?" she asked you from four feet off the ground
>Well, who are you to turn down such a polite request?
>"Of course, all you had to do was ask," you said putting the gun away
 
 
>The trip wasn't long to wherever it was
>That wolverine certainly made it easier while the two of you talked about nothing
>Eventually you were lead into a building where a lot of armed guards ran around, and soon you found yourself in what you assumed was an interrogation room
>You've been in these a hundred times before, so all you had to do was wait
>Might as well make yourself comfy at least
>You had your feet kicked up on the table when you heard the door open
>A doughy eyed fuck came in with a scowl
>A minute later he left with his fucking tail between his legs
>As entertaining as it was staring at yourself in the obviously not a one way mirror, you moved on to more important things
>Soon your next guest came in
>You were looking at pictures of cats as the much large Anthro Puma sat down across from you
>Your legs were still up table and she didn't seem to mind them
>"Mr. Anon, or, should I call you Titan?" she said with a friendly smile
>"Either will do," you grunt putting your feet on the floor
>"Look, why am I here?"
>She cleared her throat
>"Well Mr. Anon, my name is Lt Perun. I'm with RAID, and I'm sure you've heard of us"
>You held out a hand
>"Just Anon, thanks" she took it, "and yea I've heard of you. So what do you want?"
>She tapped a claw on a holopad and handed it to you
>"We want to offer you a position within RAID," she cleared her throat again "your... skills and abilities would be valuable in our upcoming plans"
>You raised an eye brow
>When she didn't laugh at her joke you looked down back on the pad
>It was a contract of sorts and from the looks of it they would have you on call
>Which meant another thing you'd have to run off to at moments noticed
>If you accepted it, that is
>"Why would you want me of all people," you're legitimately confused, "I'm sure there's some military guy, all star spangled awesome spandex with special forces training and the like out there"
>She took the pad back and tapped on it a few more times
>On it a dozen crushed faceless humans looked out to you
>"That's why," she wasn't smiling anymore
>Your frown was better than hers when you sat the pad back down
>"I didn't do any of that," you finally said while you sat back and crossed your arms
>"Sure you didn't," you caught that little snort of hers, "but you're suspected of it. Plus, we have seen what you did in the UltraLux attack"
>She had you there
>"And the rescue of your parole officer from the people who 'robbed' her makes this job that much more relevant to you"
>Fuck
>"OK, fine. What do I get from it, and what are the 'upcoming plans' you mentioned earlier?"
>A few more taps on the holopad
>"We'll wipe your record for starters- yes Anon we will," she added on from you rolling your eyes, "including the suspected homicides"
>You still weren't convinced
>"You'll get a large paycheck for it too"
>You were convinced
>Those kids could use a new entertainment center after all
>She continued when you unfolded your arms
>"As for the plans, we want to find and wipe out the Tribal's base of operations"
>You felt that Perun was largely carefree throughout the interview so far
>She was anything but when talking about crushing the Tribals
>It was your turn to grin at the seriousness in her tone
>"Well now I'm interested"
>It was no secret in those reports that they were the ones you would hit
>A burning passion drove you on with each and every mission
>To hear it from you for Perun though it must have made her day
>You were confused about one of the things she said however
>"What do you mean 'find the base of operations?' If they haven't moved out by now, then everyone knows where it is"
>Her ears go flat
>"W-what? We've been searching for weeks and we haven't found it anywhere on the ring"
>You laughed through her flustered explanation
>"Ma'm, you're looking at the wrong part then. It's an old military outpost on the space side of the ring. Swhy the Mafia didn't wipe them out yet"
>Her eyes widened at that
>"B-but that means it would have no gravity or atmosphere!"
>Your overused eyes gave another roll at that
>"They obviously got the outposts back online then."
>She's taping furiously at the pad and gawking at what she saw
>"Wait - seriously? Deadly abandoned-for-a-reason outposts SUDDENLY coming online didn't give you a hint?"
>You covered your face with a hand
>"Wait, how did-" she began
>"An Anthro who's more Aug than Dog told me about it when I got him to look after Isabelle's attack"
>You must have spooked her the fuck out when you said that from the way her short fur stood out
>"How did we miss that?!" she was scrambling to get her things, "I, uh, I need to go talk to my commander about this"
>You grab her paw and she freezes in place
>"Wait- the Pillsbury dough boy from earlier? That's your commander?!" she jerked her head at that and you released her paw after
>"That... Yeah, that doesn't give me much confidence in joining this little party of yours"
>She fidgets a bit before sitting back down
>"H-he wasn't fully prepared to meet you, and you're, uh," another fidget, "...quite intimidating"
>You smirk
>"Give me time to think and talk to my girlfriends about it. It’s a big choice to make"
>She paused and looked at you
>"Girlfriends? Like plural?"
>You smile wider
>"Yea plural. Give me your info so I can call you with my decision"
>She regained some form of professionalism when she tapped away at her pad
>Your Holophone pinged you with a new contact being stored
>"Give us a call when you decide," she took a breath
>She composed herself, this time grabbing her things in a much more orderly manner
>You follow her gestures and the two of you walk the door
>An officer is waiting out side
>It's one you had to really look down to see
>"Out this way, please," Perun says stepping out with you following, "The private will take you back home. Please hurry in making a decision"
>The private gave you a salute and held out a hand
>A stubby brown and black tail was poking out from behind the short stack officer
>"Heya Mr. Titan!" she squeaked out
>You smiled and took her hand
 
 
>Jane and Isabelle are staring at you
>"They want you to WHAT?" Jane exclaimed in shock
>"And you're going to what?" asked Isabelle just as much
>You're all sitting on the couch together while the dinner you cooked was sitting ignored
>"They want me to join RAID to wipe out the Tribals. They said if I do they'll wipe my criminal records"
>They both still stare at you in shock and concern
>"Well babe," Jane has a nerveous arm on your shoulder, "what are you going to do?"
>You think about how bad things have been for Anthros recently
>At how worried you are every time Isabelle went to work
>At how you refused to let Jane ride your hover bike anymore because it would be too easy to snatch her
>The Tribals had been the bane of your existence for as long as you remember
>You were even worse to them back a long time ago
>You were regretfully getting practice again with how even at the UltraLux there had been problems with them trying to scope out and snatch the girls there
>The men too, with little success when it came to stealth
>You weren't blind to their fear for what you had told them
>They felt how you did right now every time they left the house
>But you had to do it
>You wanted to do it
>Now you just had to say the words to mean it
>"I... I think I'm gonna do it. I want you both safe, I want everyone safe, and if we have children I want them to not be afraid to walk down the street"
>Jane's paw on your shoulder became a little tighter and a soft paw from Isabelle held the top of your bunched up hands
>Jane had a mixed look of concern and pride, Isabelle looked even more worried
>"I don't like it Anon, I don't want to see you get hurt or..." Isabelle whimpered
>You pull her into a hug
>"I'll be fine, I promise," you whisper to her with your fingers making circles on the fur of her back
>Jane wrapped her arms around the two of you further tightening the embrace
>"He'll be fine Izzy," Jane tried to sound reassuring, "Don't worry about Anon, he's doing this for us and he needs out support"
>Concern is still painted across Isabelle's muzzle
>You looked into her pink eyes staring at you
>They were absolutely terrified
>"Promise me you'll stay safe and not do anything reckless"
>You smiled through and gave her a quick kiss, slowly rocking her body with Jane still holding on
>"I'm always reckless," you chuckled
>You finally got a smile out of her when she whapped you gently with a padded paw
>"Ok, don't do anything TOO reckless"
>"And DO keep us in the know, ok?" added Jane
>You broke from the fuzzy cuddle pile to dig out your Holophone
>You sent a quick message to Perun
>"Now can we please eat? I slaved over a hot (admittedly higher-end) Biodispenser to make this meal that's getting cold"
>Isabelle is too busy shoveling her food down to say anything
>Stress eating isn't all that surprising for her, not with how your life has been going currently
>You're still careful in watching what you make though
>Jane is a lot more reserved in eating with her quick glances your's and Izzy's way
>You also eat your food and settle into the couch with two beautiful ladies
>You’ll never stop saying that
>Thank fuck Jane is as cool as she is, you've never seen her have a problem with Isabelle after that night
>Nothing can ruin this life you had built
>Your friends, your allies, and certainly your hands and feet won’t allow it
>And you're sure as fuck weren't about to let the Tribals do it either
 
 
>You're back at the RAID headquarters
>This time of your own volition, only being slightly harassed by outside security  
>Perun came and saved the day during that little hiccup and she was also your guide through the various hallways currently
>"You're going to be one of the team Heavies. You carry the big guns, get the best heaviest armor we can supply... Just know that you're also on the front line"
>She leads you into a room that you recognize as an Armor Nanoconstructor
>From the size of this thing though, you don't think you’ll be getting a fancy new bullet resistant suit out of it
>Alexandra would love the hell out of this back in the UltraLux
>She has you stand on a raised circular platform in the center of the machine
>"Seeing as you tend to use your fists and boots more than a gun," she says, tapping away at a panel, "we are going to have you in a Mark 16 Fulgur Blitz PowerArmor"
>Jesus, they must think highly of you with how expensive the materials were needed for that kind of rig
>A suit of thick armor starts to form around you
>"M16FBPA. Bit of a mouthful isn't it?" she continued
>"The boys lovingly call it the Striker Special"
>"Can I make a request?" you ask with suit finishing up your pants
>"What's that?"
>"Can you give the helmet horns?"
>"Easily," you could feel that smirk from here, but dammit - nothing would stop you
>Skin is skill, after all. The cooler you looked, the better you are
>The suit finished building itself around you
>You flexed and moved in it a few times to work out the kinks
>Finding none, Perun clicked a button and it materializes into an attachable clip
>She also handed you a stack of datachips
>"Oh boy, my favorite," you say glumly
>She must have ignored it, seemingly more excited about your gear more than you
>"That armor is more than just armor! It stores kinetic energy that build up the more you move! Get enough and you super charge that armor and devastate anything in your path!"
>"For about thirty seconds that is," she finally caught her breath
>Neat
>"It should be bulletproof (yes, proof - not resistant!) can reflect lasers and it all melds directly over your combat suit"
>"From what we've seen and what's been reported to us that suit there is overkill"
>You left the room with her and she talked the whole way down
>"You will literally be a walking tank," she finally finished gushing
>You arrive by a window into an office space and through it you spot the familiar old man
>He's been staring for a while now
>"He still scared of me?"
>She looked at him
>"Yeah, he's actually terrified of you Anon. He wants me to keep you on a short leash"
>"Oh really," you droll out
>She held her paws up in mock surrender
>"I told him you couldn't be on one, rather you just had to be pointed in the right direction"
>You smile and grunt in approval
>"Anything else for today?"
>"No, but we will be in contact once we official find their staging area. When we do that, we'll need to have a direct plan of attack. Stay safe out there"
>She motioned towards the exit and waves you off as you leave
>Some of her giddiness from before must have rubbed off on you
>Soon enough you'll be able to legally rip and tear
>You can hardly wait

Chapter 22: What we fight for 

>It's been roughly 2 weeks since you were recruited into RAID
>Lt Perun told you they would contact you when they had a plan built up and would call in everyone
>You also learned that you weren't the only UltraLux employee that got recruited
>Shaxx and Alexandra were joining you in the Heavy Division
>Ronnie with his freakish reflexes got to be a sniper (he made an extra effort to let you know when he giddily showed off his new 'void rifle' that supposedly shot mini black holes)
>Lawrence with his ability to turn invisible landed him a spot with the Infiltrators
>Nelly wanted to go heavy, but got stuck with Lawrence due to her size, and the look on her face clutching that twice her size auto rifle during her latest attempt only made it worse for you
>"But think of all the sweet business offers we'd get!" she whined, adding "and it even reloads itself!" with a small sniffle after
>As much as you were for her Battle Sling offer, you just couldn't risk having a 60 pound fox shooting a 120 pound machine gun strapped to your chest
>Axel was brought on board to monitor the computer systems and camera feeds, and you still weren't sure if he or Ronnie was the more excited of the two with their shiny new toys
>Thankfully Hunter was already there having already been placed on the Medic role
>He was the first to practice his new job with Axel who so helpfully went near comatose at the sight of his new rig
>Eugene whined when he heard about you all getting chosen
>"Hey I'm useful too!" he protested
>He only calmed down when we told him the Lux still needed a guard, and the recording of Axel twitching on the floor sealed the deal
>Theo turned down the invitation for the same reason, saying "someone needs to watch the UltraLux. Someone Steven can actually trust," he added
>Overall, just about everyone you knew got in
>It was nice to know you guys wouldn't be a tangled ball of fur and skin whenever the first mission started
>Jane was already happy for you, and even more so when you told her your original crew had your back as well
>"From a common thug to a defender of the ring! I'm so proud of what you've become!"
>She said that the change in you was admirable, but you knew you had always wanted to protect people
>You just weren't given the chance to do it your way until now
>Jane's enthusiasm didn't have an effect on Isabelle
>She was nervous about the whole thing and you still hated the stress you were causing her
>You're still thankful she hasn't seen who you were before with only bits and pieces telling her otherwise
>"I don't want to lose you, you're my best friend!" she would often hug you and whimper her concerns
>"You'll never lose me," every time you would pat her head and reassure her
>You used those DataChips Lt Perun gave you during those first few days on the job
>She had reassured you that a mission wouldn't be planned while everyone was settling in
>When the boxing lessons only tickled you in comparison, you could see why she told everyone that
>You personally had it the worst with Shaxx often giving you looks of regret through his own personal migraines
>You couldn't deny the results though
>They gave you special attention when one of their medics gave you a vial they described as a 'cerebral accelerators'
>Hunter was quick to snatch it out of their hands before you could
>"Blood Raiter CAs from ein now dead group. Imbreziffe, und fery illekal," he hummed through his inspections, "zee chibs vill purn right through your skull in no time at all," his accent unrestrained from his own chip training hell
>"...Esbecially vith how zey are tripals now," a dark laugh followed
>But it worked
>And to your disgust, almost too well
>Combat movement, armor limits, how to supercharge your gear and the weapons you would use
>Scenarios would play in what little sleep you had as the serum worked through your mind to speed up the pain
>Jane still worked in the same place as you, and it was only from her help that you could make it in for your shifts
>Although you couldn't be her guard due to 'personal workplace conflicts' she could still be there for you when she could
>One by one you worked through the pile, each with a bottle of asprin and a day's worth of rest
>The suspense was killing you even more
>The calm before the storm was awful and you just wanted it to hit and be done with it
>A nice little gift came in the form of a new DigiGlove that Perun had personally tuned to your weapons
>A full auto hand held Gatling gun came with the whole package, and although it was cumbersome to hold it shredded the targets you practiced on
>Col. Dregen apparently hated that
>He didn't want you to have heavy weapons when he read the report
>As great as it was you didn't care either way; at close range a fist is better than any gun
>Now if only these skills could be applied to games
 
>You were currently at home with Jane and Isabelle as they streamed an FPS game together
>They were popular to say the least, as apparently Jane's fans loved watching her play and completely adored Isabelle
>You couldn't really blame them
>They were both gorgeous, with great personalities that they always wanted more of
>And besides, who doesn't feel good known your ladies were admired so much?
>"Izzy they're flanking us! You got them?"
>"Yeah I got them, just watch the right"
>You were sitting out of frame from their double streaming setup and thankful you weren't gaming too
>It's not that you didn't want to; you're just so bad at those games that you knew they would just get frustrated
>So being the wonderful boyfriend you were you acted as their waiter
>You got them drinks and snacks and anything else they would ask for
>A small Awoooooooooooo sound went off
>"Thank you for the donation!" Isabelle cheered happily from her incredibly relaxed spot on the couch
>With both legs stretched out over the cushions and her chest smothering her controller, she gave a more intense Jane a grin
>Jane was leaning forward with a steel grip on her controller, and she only leaned even more from every poke from one of Isabelle's toes
>For you, and her viewers, it was awesome that she decided to wear one of your ill fitting tank tops today
>Whenever they streamed together they would each host their own on separate channels
>They both had little competitions to see who could get more donations and the greater the gap, the bigger the smack talk
>Jane wouldn't be beaten
>Isabelle had sprung her trap with her latest poke, and before she knew it both of her legs were caught in a vice from a cackling Jane pulling her along
>"C'mon Team Janet!" she said through the flailing limbs, "Don't let little Izzy here beat us!" she gave them another shake
>"Now, if you donate to me I'll let you see me~" she leaned in to her microphone "holding our boyfriend's hand"
>"You wouldn't dare!" said the now frozen legs
>"Oohoho~ That's up to them to decide"
>A purring sound suddenly came from her computer
>"Yay! Thank you for your donations!" she finally let go of Isabelle and snapped her fingers for you
>"Boyfriend, come here!"
>You walked over with a smile and she took your hand into hers
>Your face is still off camera but your hand locked in paw was clearly visible
>"Ohhhh, how lewd" cooed a slightly less flustered Isabelle
>A sneaky wolf paw wormed it's way onto your other hand and held it up on the other side
>Another Awoooooooooooo sound quickly followed
>"Wha- hey!" the tigress paw gripped down on you
>The sound gave off a purr soon after, and soon your other got crushed as well
>A ringing sound from your holophone got the torture to stop, and with a smile you excused yourself to the kitchen
>You finally answer it once inside and a hologram of a grim looking Lt Perun appeared
>You're heart sank a little at what you'd be told
>"Anon, we are being deployed for our assault on the Tribal's stronghold in 2 days. Rest up, and in the meantime I'm sending you the info for our briefing"
>You nod and sigh
>While you were glad it was finally happening it still bothered you to leave Jane and Isabelle
>The hologram winked out and you closed your phone
>You looked into the room where Jane and Isabelle played and talked happily
>You're hesitant on what you should do
>Should you tell them now?
>...No
>Let them have their fun
>You distracted yourself by starting dinner
>Better to not ruin a good night together
 
>It's time
>You're in a meeting room at the RAID headquarters and your to not use the chips yesterday barely offset the nerves
>There are a lot of unfamiliar faces in the briefing room and you can't help but feel a bit out of place
>Most of these men and women from both sides had chosen this life
>The handful of you that hadn't stuck out like a sore thumb
>You're in a t-shirt plastered with Jane's stream name and jeans compared to the soldiers fatigues
>And Shaxx didn't even bother with that with his baggy gym clothes
>The rest of you were in various street wear and Alexandra topped it off by wearing pink fuzzy slippers
>They didn't want to gang up on the murder gator or the scary huge human, so Shaxx took all the blame
>When confronted about it he angrily shouted 'if they wanted me dressed in a certain way then they should have said so'
>As well as the poor timing cutting into his daily workout time
>That was a little while ago; the room has been deathly silent now

>Nelly was in your lap as Col. Dregen stood in front of a clear image of the once abandoned military outpost turned slavers den
>From what you could see 'abandoned' was the biggest joke you've ever heard
>It was literally a military base: a solid boxy wall surrounded the main compound, with(presumably) manned guard towers and some heavy AA batteries
>Worst of all was the heavily armored gate where few buildings dotted both sides of it's walls, and a singular cover-less pathway to it
>You're a big dude and stealth isn't your specialty
>With a design like that, it wasn't anyone else's either
>There was no way in hell they wouldn't know you were coming the moment you got there
 
>"Right so this is a dozy people," said a concerned Dregen
>'No shit,' whispered you and Nelly
>"The competing Tribal gangs united and turned this outpost into a fucking fortress"
>The image zoomed to the outer walls
>"There are at least 4 snipers at all times and round the clock shifts of general foot soldiers"
>"Hopefully, our own boys will be a better shot than some crazed, possibly high moon men"
>A few nervous laughs filled the room
>"...Though even if you are, there's another problem to deal with"
>The image gave a bird's eye view of small rusted metal buildings on either side of the gate, with a few more crowding the interior corners on the inside of the compound
>He highlighted the tallest ones in red
>"Machine gun nests. If they can't land a straight shot on you, you can bet your ass they'l spray at you. Bastards have just about every single one of the taller ones filled with heat signatures suggesting that kind of firepower"
>ok
>"We don't know what ammo type, either"

>The image panned to the street level, with the smaller metallic buildings being highlighted in blue
>"These are minefields, to put it simply. They knowingly risk their own structures to set a long straight kill route you will have to pass through"
>K
>"I wouldn't be surprised if they littered the gate as well"
>Sure
>"Expect a horde when you go in. Too many bodies are blocking out any potentially captured Anthros, but we are assuming the bottom floor of the central building"
>Fine, just means there'l be more volunteers to fist
>"We don't know where the captured Anthros are for sure though , we can't find any heat signatures"

>"And these-"
>There's more?
>The image once again centered itself on the gate, where towers slightly behind the main wall started to appear in green
>"Are the reason why we aren't outright bombing the place. They are aptly named Anti Spacecraft Cannons, or ASCs for a reason."
>The map was soon replaced with a model of a monstrous double barreled gun attached to a rotating platform
>Wedged metal on either side of the hull opened up to reveal a missile system to accompany the gun's light show
>"If the rails don't get you, the rockets definitely will"
>And I'm guessing...
>"This is the priority target the Heavy squad will be going for. They will be lightly assisted from afar"
>And you got to tank this gloriously dangerous raid
>...You better get a sweet looking helmet after all this
>You thought you were handling the stress pretty well
>You thought so, anyways
>An equally nervous Nelly was grabbing at your hand that's been over petting her during the show
>Your muttered "sorry" was drowned out by the crowd's loud murmurs
>"Destroy that, and the rest of us can join in," Dregen finished

>Looking out into the crowd around you, the other people have formed small groups, with a few of them occasionally glancing back at the slowly spinning hologram of the fortress
>As much as you hate the fact that you're essentially going to be a bullet sponge, you cant exactly argue about it either
>A frontal assault on a highly fortified base like that would be dangerous to anyone without heavy duty armor
>But the unknown caliber of the nests put a literal hole into that fact
>Bullets you'd be fine against and lasers would be a special case
>Plasma? That'l take a limb or two
>Or outright explode in your face
>The mines will be a fun bit too, so that's going to take some creative dancing to get around


>Lt Perun stepped on the small stage and stood next to Dregen
>She cleared her throat, and the room quieted down
>"As you've no doubt noticed, luckily we recruited a few extra hands for our specialists"
>She motions to you and the other UltraLux security members, and a few others to the side
>"The security team from the UltraLux that helped fend off Gabriel Flinn's attack are joining us"
>All eyes are on you and the others
>"As well as... Mr. Clean? The professional street sweeper," Perun squinted her eyes on the card before her
>It would've been rude to do so before, but now all eyes stared at the squat rat man
>They stared in disbelief as they scanned his mismatching clothes that made garbage look clean
>"Murder hobo" whispered someone in the crowd
>The hobo's eyes immediately locked onto the offending whisperer and his eyes bug out larger than you thought possible while drawing a line over his neck
>An ammo drum fell from one of his inner pockets at the end of his flourish and in a flash of movement it was gone
>Col. Dregen cleared his throat while the rat muttered to himself
>"And yes, even those who I would rather not be here with us," his eyes fell on you
>He looked away the second you stared back
>"Are here to help," he finished
>The air was thick with tension
>Sucks that they didn't all have a lap fox to pet
>"We will be moving out shortly. Gear up and lets go"
 
>You and the others are on a troop carrier headed to the space side of the ring in a sturdy combat hull
>The crawler couldn't go airborn with their currently active AA potentially blasting you out of the sky
>So you sat there thinking the minutes away with Shaxx and Alexandra close by
>You were on your way to fortress full of dead men
>they just didn't know that they were dead yet
>Shaxx sat next to you in his orange and white powerarmor, and he was just as quiet as everyone else
>When Alexandra joined you, you almost didn't recognize her over the walking pile of plated metal with what appeared to be a full mortar attached to her back
>Your armor is on and polished to a sheer black, and with every jostle your suit hummed a little more from the kinetic servos drinking it up
 
>You wish you were nervous from the warnings that blared minutes away from the op
>To have some sort of need to cower away, stay alive, and to abandon this dangerous plan
>They can't nuke the place from orbit due to all the Anthros potentially hidden there
>It would of made one hell of a light show if they did
>You lost that feeling the moment you stepped on this boat, and felt it even less as the seconds crawled on by
>Anything to kill this slow compounding eagerness
>You just couldn't help it
>Eager to make the ring safe
>Eager to fight alongside your friends
>Eager to rip and tear
>To put no thought into it, with every one of them justifiable in some way
>Only the sound of Shaxx fiddling with his Gatling Laser kept you grounded in reality
>"Sights not right," he'd mumble from every adjustment
>Alexandra just paced back and forth
>You never left your seat
>On your HUD from the helmet, a picture of Jane and Isabelle was to the side
>You've been looking at it ever since you put on this tin can


>They had been so worried when they dropped you off at RAID headquarters, and when you were still able to receive outside calls, it was the last thing they sent you
>It was a picture of Jane and Isabelle with their arms locked, with Jane having a fist pump and a thumbs up from Isabelle
>You could tell it had taken multiple takes just to keep their composure
>One last hug and a kiss from each of them before you left for all this
>Of course you hated to leave them behind, but you had to do this to protect them
>The sound of a loudspeaker kept you from going to a very dark place
>"We are landing in t-minus 30 seconds"

>Lt Perun's voice cuts into the comms of your helmet
>"Heavy weapons ready, snipers aim high, Infiltrators disappear!"
>An opossum you just now noticed clicked a button on her suit and vanished into the air
>Dregen's joined in after
>"Now hear this: All squads must wait outside the AO for the heavies to pull fire. Your death at the hands of machine fire will all be on you"
>"Heavies, your primary objective remains taking out those ASCs. Just be sure to cause some noise while you do"
>"I'm sure you all agree with me in saying that a pre-combat speech is unnecessary. Sweeping away dirt just doesn't seem all that special"
>You felt a twitch of a smile
>"...Just don't forget why you are all out here today"
>You didn't know Dregen had a spine
>You did now from the pure seething rage that hissed out from his words
>It definitely had an effect on your squad mates
>They were both strapped in and unmoving staring straight ahead, and when the sound of bullet fire started impacting the sides not a one of you flinched
>"Squad leaders, sound off!"
>A heavy hand fell on your shoulder while voices spoke out through comms
>"Ready Titan? Alexandra?" you heard Shaxx call out
>It was your turn now
>"Ready," was all you say
>The only human of your squad's three Heavies
>You don't remember if there were any others in your group as well
>It was perfect
>You didn't have to worry about who was friend or foe
>A red light turned on with lights heading towards the cargo doors
>The three of you got up and held onto rails, ready to leap out the moment you can
>Fist clenched, gun loaded, and the portable mortar safely secured you were ready
>"Heavies, you're in first! Take down those ASCs!" roared Dregen's voice
>The doors opened, and you charged
 
>Breathe
>Live in the now
>Run like a madman through the massive amount of bullets flying your way
>The moment the door opened and the three of you charged, a pathway appeared on your HUD
>It was a curving line that erratically flew over the dirt
>An explosion to your right told you why
>"Stick to the line and you'l make it through," Axel helpfully confirmed
>S'bit harder with all the flying lead, the occasional laser, and the incredibly unwanted balls of plasma
>The brown dust clouds with red and green light shows would of made a pretty cool rave
>It's a pretty good thing that most of the shells are harmless
>The three of you do your best to follow the lines through the mine field
>You were leading the charge currently, with Shaxx and Alexandra close behind
>At some point during your run whoever manned the machine nests had come up with a deadly plan
>Even when their target is just some guys and the floor, it was very rare for bullets to actually bounce off your armor
>So instead of going for you, they focused fire at just about everywhere near you
>The explosions were immediate and clustered together the closer you got to the gate
>A line of bullets in the sand stopped you entirely
>"Too many hot spots out here Axel, gimme a new route!" you say from the floor
>That last chain of explosions knocked you on your ass with your suit taking most of the force
>When the bombs settled down a massive dirt cloud kicked up giving some form of cover
>"Yeah, yeah working on it!"
>"Any da-JESUS," the lord answered your prayers when you spread your legs from a now burning hole
>"Excellent form Titan!" even during a literal shitstorm, Shaxx can still find the time to laugh
>You had to roll a few times when more blobs and lasers came your way
>The machine gun nests were tall, but not in the way you could see them
>Which means...
>"All ready on it"
>You find the time to stand just as the giant gator stands next to you
>That monster of a mortar cAnon rotated forward before locking in place
>A handle and a scope were already in place, and you can count all her teeth from that wild wicked grin she has
>"'v been waiting to try this," either nerves or excitement shakes Alex when her claws grip the handle and the other on the barrel
>Still on the floor you throw an arm over your head
>A good thing too from the heat you felt right next to you
>Alexandra was laughing from her new spot ten feet away at the gigantic green ball of plasma flying through the air
>It was almost comical with how all of your heads tracked it's lazy arc
>All three of you had the right idea when it smashed right into a sniper tower
>"Nice shot Alexandra!" booms Shaxx
>She's in a bit of a daze while she reloads the gun, dropping a heavy spent fuel cell and fumbling with the second
>With a clawed thumbs up she's good to go
>You stopped the firing squad momentarily, no doubt surprised by (from their perspective) mini green shooting off her larger, meaner cousin
>"Well then, that'l make things a bit easier," Axel is back on comms with you on your feet
>"Cut through the buildings, they shouldn't be armed like the street is. Sending it... now!"
>Your route phases out for a second on your HUD only to reappear in a different color and taking a sharp left
>The bullets came back, too
>You only set off about 20 more mines when you make it to the first bit of cover
>The western Machine gun nest
>the Metal door flew off its hinges, screeching through the room before crushing an unfortunate Tribal between it and the wall
>the 5 remaining tribals turn to you and open fire with some small caliber rifles
>> you grabbed the closest one and threw him into his friends who made the mistake of standing too close together
>you Materialized your Grenade launcher and fire off a single implosion grenade
>the screams they make as their bodies collapse into each other is music to your ears
>as you stormed up the stairs to the actual machine gun you hear a small 'ding ding ding" 
>You grinned as yellow text crossed your HUD "Supercharged"
>with a flying leap you're above the Machine gun itself and you active the charge
>30 seconds, it warned you while you flew through the air
>Your supercharged armored body slammed into the Machine gun like lightning death from above and the Tribals who survived the initial blast were vaporized by the arcs that exploded out of you
>25 seconds
>You blasted through a wall and found yourself next to another building that you decided to ignore the door for, crashing through the wall like a terrifying Kool-aid man
>And maybe two more after that
>You were the first and last guest for every party you crashed
>The sound of Shaxx on your comms and the boom of plasma fire assured you your team was still going strong
>Your suit however was at its limit
>When you rounded a corner it was gone entirely
>The Tribal you met brought his shotgun up, firing frantically as you charged him
>He dropped his gun and struggled to pry off the iron grasp around his throat
>You look past him to a road and recalled there being a minefield
>"Hey, what do seagulls say?" you said through a cold smile you knew he couldn't see
>"Uhh.. caw?" he choked out
>You dragged him to the side of the road
>"Naw son they say MINE!" as his body was sent sailing into the minefield
>You always loved watching fireworks, and somehow making your own felt that much better
>One after another they shot into the air exploding the others around them
>Your smirk was cut short when you finally noticed the alarm going off
>"Western machine gun nests cleared," you call through comms while you charged towards stairs running up the outer wall
>"Eastern nest down," Shaxx said seconds later


>The wall for the most part had been picked clean by the sniper teams, you could see the glints of light from their scopes on top of the carriers
>When you reached the top you noticed a huge group a mob of heavily armed Tribals pouring out of a building you assumed to be the main headquarters
>Their front lines had heavy duty bullet and energy resistant shields
>Behind that were men carrying Plasma rifles
>All of them wore different colors
>How did they get so organized? They weren't like this before
>Back when you were fighting them on the streets they didn't act like this
>This was an army formation, and whoever taught them gave them the balls to stand up to the actual Ring's military unit!
>'Who could do this?' 
>You clenched your fists
>It didn't matter who or what decided to bring them to your fists
>You will shatter their faces like every other Tribal
>A cackling voice was sent through all comms
>"EHAHAHA- Sniper team Alpha has taken down all men on western wall! Look at all that fresh meat!"
>"I really wish I wasn't with this crazy coyote.." came Ronnies voice over the "UltraLux" frequency Axel set up
>"Axel gimme a route!" you yelled through, "wheres the ASC?"
>A line appeared on your HUD pointing the way to stampede towards
>"RODER VILL CRUSH TINY MEN!" something roared through your comms
>Even under fire you took a moment to stop and admire the spectacle before you
>A large wolf in power armor decorated to look like a Viking was tearing down the eastern wall with wild strikes from a giant chain axe
>You even managed to see him lift a man and bite into his throat mid swing
>"Geez where did they find him" squeaked Nelly
>"Prison," you answer, "he was in maximum security for eating Tribals"

>Storming down the western wall you saw Alexandra launching volley after volley of plasma at a shielded phalanx of Tribals that were currently pinned down by Shaxx and his Gatling laser
>You kicked the door in of a still standing tower that a group of Tribals were hiding in
>The multiple controls near the side told you why
>You were in the gatehouse, and all the men here weren't trained for combat
>Only the ones who could stop and think before shooting at everyone were made to be handlers
>Handlers and trainers of the ones they caught
>A stomp to one of their faces caused the metallic wall to quake
>Another well place punch sent one through the glass and over the wall, into the minefield waiting below
>The "plink plink plink" from their harmless handgun bullets ricocheting off your armor was music to your ears
>You had also flipped a table over at one point, crushing two of them together
>But finally, only one stream of bullets remained
>You turned around and faced the final tribal
>He continued firing wildly as you slowly stepped toward him
>*click click*
>"Out of ammo... shoulda charged the clip" you said coldly as you advanced on him
>He tripped over a body belonging to one of his own where he then dropped his gun
>The closer you got to him the more he raised his arms up, and you eventually got into grabbing range
>And since he so kindly offered, you grabbed one of his arms
>A well placed boot on his chest and a little tug upwards made him a little lighter
>His arm was limp in your grip with it no longer apart of his body
>He was screaming and clutching at the bloody stump where it used to be
>With your smile hidden, a faceless monster in his eyes - you played your role and bashed him across the face with your brand new club
>You kept at it until he was barely moving
>A new idea came to mind just then, and it started with dragging him out
>With the help of his other arm you did and each tug you gave the floor behind you became a little more red
>In no time at all you were outside and standing right above the gate
>You wanted to make more fireworks
>So you did when you hurled his now awake body over the edge and to the ground
>When the resulting cloud had settled you could see the multiple blast marks next to the gate itself
>A surge of RAID officers suddenly flooded towards the gate having apparently being camping in the devastated buildings
>A tidal wave of Tribals came to meet them and the resulting storm quickly filled with chaotic gun battles
>You've had enough fun for now though
>The ASC is in sight as you make your way over to it
>When you got close you saw it was heavily armored; more than any other defense system you've ever seen
>"Hey Perun, how do I destroy this thing?" you called out over the comms
>"Is your armor charged?"
>"Naw, used it on the machine gun nest"
>There was a pause in her voice which Axel filled instead

>"Do you mind losing your shotgun? You could overload it and hit it with an implosion grenade from your grenade launcher"
>Well shit, that'll do it
>If there was a hole to lodge it in, that is
>Your suit was moderately charged from all the sprinting you've done since the last one, so you had that going for you too
>you call forth your shotgun and think about it as you hold it in your armored heavy hands
>This gun was with you During the UltraLux attack
>It was there when you saved Isabelle
>It held a special place in your heart
>But you think of Jane and Isabelle, was their happiness worth more than this gun?
>You bet your armored ass it was
>You pull and hold the trigger for a bit 
>The whole shotgun begins shaking and heating up, small arcs jump between it and your hands
>You shove the now glowing shotgun down the Barrel of the ASC and materialize your grenade launcher
>"Cya buddy" is the final farewell to your shotgun as you launch a grenade down the ASC's barrel
>You thought you got tanned a little from the ASC imploding in a marvelous bath of plasma and green light

>"Western ASC is down" you call out through the Comms
>"Shaxx is dealing with the eastern one now! Infiltrators have you found the missing Anthros?"
>You hear an unfamiliar voice 
>"There's a large underground vault down here with that needs a code, we think they are in there, we're looking for a way in"
>With that you charge off to the Main building, or at least you assumed it was the main building because it was in the center of the compound and was the biggest
>You jump off the wall into the freshly cleared minefield and take off
>Most of the ground forces of the tribals had been eliminated at this point
>RAID soldiers were either rounding them up or finishing them off
>Roder was tearing a lifeless body to pieces
>"Heavies head inside and catch up with the infiltrators, we need to find those Anthros" Dergen's voice cuts through the comms
>You hear the sound of more troop carriers landing nearby as you surge forwards
>Those poor souls, trapped, tortured and stripped of everything they were for what?  For some rich prick on Terra or where ever to have a sex toy?
>Not if you could help it
>You throw yourself at the giant doors of the stronghold, Fully expecting them to crumple 
>Only they don't give at all and you bounce off onto the ground
>Fuck that smarts
>"Titan get out of the way!"
>you have just enough time to glance up and roll out of the way as a Giant plasma burst turns the doors into a pile of molten metal and slag
>"ALEX WHAT THE FU-"
>"SORRY YA'll OK?!"
>you brush a bit of dust and metal scraps off yourself as you stand
>"Peachy"
>Alexandra and Shaxx join you at the doorway
>"Nice of the Tribals to invite us over for dinner, eh Titan? Shaxx says as you step through the ruined doors
>"Very nice of them, lets see whats cooking"
>"Axel we need a route to that vault"
>A path highlights in your HUD and the three of you run to it
>Down stairs
>So far down into the depths of the ring Structure
>The Infiltrators said it was underground but this is ridiculous
>You continue until a set of heavy steel doors is before you
>Shaxx goes to pull them open, no chance you were letting Alexandra use thatmoorter inside
BWOOM!
>An explosion rips them off their hinges and Into Shaxx, sending him flying backwards
>"SHAXX!" 
>You turn to get him
>"GO TITAN! I'LL BE FINE!" you hear him though the Comms
>"You better fucking be or I'll kill you myself!"
>The doors are gone and a huge room filled monitors and a stage
>This must be where they auction off the poor souls 
>And in the center of the room is a man in a Powerframe
>A giant mech made to make power armor obsolete but too expensive to make and use regularly
>He's fully loaded with several rocket launchers and a gatling laser all trained at you
>You charge him anyway
>Fuck the powerframe, he might be standing at 20 feet tall and able to stomp you but FUCK HIM
>"HAHAHA THE DUST GIANT! I CANT BELIEVE I GET TO KILL Y-"
>You supercharge your armor and slam into his frame legs, destroying them
>"HEY MAN AT LEAST LET ME FINISH MY SPEECH YOU DICK"
>the frame is falling over, the sound of sparks and screeching metal fill the room 
>15 seconds
>He's trying to escape the cockpit,
>10 seconds
>You jump and have only one thing to say to the struggling man
>"You talk to much" 
>Hurtling like a electric meteor you crash into the cockpit
>Everything around you explodes in fire and arcs of blazing blue electricity
>You stand in the Center of a crater, smoke and fire fill the room as steam pours from your vents
>"Good show there Titan"
>Shaxx is limping along with the help of Alexandra
>She looks at you with concern
>"I gotta take him up, he's bleedin' something fierce"
>Shaxx waves you over and places a hand on your shoulder
>"Finish this"
>You nod and get running
>After another few minutes of running you find Nelly and a few other of the infiltrators at a large vault door with a small number pad next to it
>>Nelly jumps on your shoulder, full of excitment
>"Titan we can't get through! the number pad is the only way in! we checked every vent!"
>You walk to the pad and prepare to punch it
>"Whoa whoa whoa there Anon don't do that! the whole thing is rigged with explosives!" Perun's voice stops you
>"Are there any tribals around that know the code?"
>Nelly bounces happily on your shoulder
>"Yea yea yea! we found 3 of them trying to get into it before we snatched them!"
>"Show me"
>An Opussom leads you to a room with three tattooed men tied up, backs to the wall
>"Anon what are you doing? They won't talk we tried to bargain with them!"
>You can hardly contain your smile
>"My turn to bargain, Axel cut my Audio and video feed"
>you hear tapping and then "got it"
>"HEY ANO-" *click*
> you look at the men and pull off your helmet, setting it aside
>"Nelly I need you to leave, this is gonna get messy"
>"G-got it Titan" she scurries off
>You tower over the now trembling men
>"Do you know who I am?"
>"Y-y-oure the dust giant"
>You smile and kneel in front of the center man
>"Thats right, now I need you to tell me the code to those doors"
>The one to the right grows a spine
>"FUCK YOU! THOSE FURBALLS DESERVE TH-" 
>You don't even look at him as you slam the back of his head into the wall, crushing it into nothing but splattered bone and brain matter
>You never once broke eye contact with the man in front of you
>you Wipe your hand on the trembling mans shirt, cleaning it of any blood and brain matter
>"Nelly, if you please I need a knife with a thin tip and a flare" you call into the other room
>the gentle pitter patter of paws hitting the floor creep up behind you
>"Here Titan" she hands you your new tools
>"Close the door please"
>The sound of the door closing is cue to start the party
>You light up the flare and set it down gently, you can see the light from it fizzing in their eyes
>"Now then...I got a little bit of time, and now that there are two of you I'll have to make this last" you say as you twirl the knife in your fingers
>"I'll ask nicely one more time, what the Code to the door?"
>The men shiver before you like newborn pups
>"W-we don't kno-"
>He doesn't get to finish as you grab his bottom Jaw and hold it open
>You dig the knife point into his gums and pry Upwards, wrenching  a tooth out
>He screams and writhes trying to escape your grasp
>You set the knife down and grab the flare and press it into the gaping hope where the tooth was
>Picking up the tooth from the floor you look at both men before crushing it in your palm to dust
>"Each time you don't answer my question I'm going to pry another tooth out"
>You set the flare back down 
>"Then I'm going to burn the wound closed so you don't go into shock from blood loss"
>You smile the most cruel smile you can
>"And even if you don't know it; well at least I got to have some fun before I find someone who does"
>You twirl the knife delicately on your fingertips
>"So.. What's that code"


>10 minutes later you walk out of the room
>"The code is 671548" you call before donning your helmet again
>Nelly jumps back on your shoulder
>"Axel comms and video please" you say into Nelly's earpiece
>You hear the comms flick back on
>Dergen's voices roars through
>"ANON WHAT WAS THAT, YOU DONT GET TO DECIDE WHE-"
>"Shut it doughboy, I got the code, we need evac teams"
>The vault door opens
>What lies before is a prison and torture chamber
>Anthros chained to various devices, strapped to tables and locked in cages
>You see what appears to be a scientist look up at the door in surprise
>"I get this one" you hear Nelly growl before pouncing
>She makes what should have been a quick kill a little longer than necessary
>Genetic re-sequencers, Braindomes with brainwashing datachips, flat out torture devices
>They were literally taking Anthros and reshaping them to how buyer wanted them
>You set about unstrapping and unchaining the captured Anthros with Nelly
>Many of them know you from you living in the slums
>Some of them are little more than kittens and pups
>They latch onto you as you free them
>You see Perun and Dergen walking into the room as Hunter and various other doctors enter
>Dergen looks like he's going to stomp over and yell at you but the sight of you covered in someone's blood seems to stop him
>Good you weren't in the mood for it
>You recognize the dalmatian Medic from Isabelle's attempted kidnapping and wave him down
>"Sir? Do I know you" he asks as you pass him a sobbing lion cub
>You dematerialize your helmet and smile "Heyoo"
>"Mr. Anon! you went full on for revenge against the tribals Huh!?"
>You nod and tell him to take care of the cub
>Clean up is going good
>But something pings the back of your mind
>Who did all this?
>Wordlessly you leave the room and go back to whats left of the 2 tribals
>"I'll ask once, how do I get to the boss"
>They reel back from you
>"H-hidden elevator in the vault, pull the chain towards the back of the room, the one with a single silver colored screw" 
>You flash a Quick Smile
>"See how easy that was? Why didn't you do that before?"
>You leave them and head to the secret elevator
>To your surprise it does exactly as the tribal says
>You step into the elevator and turn to see Perun's wide eyes fixed on you in shock
>The doors close before she even can react

>A long quiet swoooooosh noise is present as the elevator ascends 
>After a bit the doors open with a quiet Swish
>You're in a hallway with white marble floors and large white stone pillars
>There a set of intricately carved doors made of some kind of redwood 
>Pushing them open you're in an office
>Looking around your heart sinks
>Anthro pelts line the floor like rugs
>A panda, a polar bear, a white tiger
>A golden tiger..
>You clench your fist and feel your anger rising
>Who ever this was would pay
>"Ahh Anon, its been a while"
>You know that voice somehow
>A man in his early fifties walks out from a side room and sits at his desk facing you
>That face
>Impossibly Derek's face looks at you, older than you remember but its still him
>"Derek? HOW?"
>"Ah you remember my son, you were his friend after all before some Anthro trash murdered him"
>His father? You had met him only once
>Jason Brown, a politician on the ring
>"What?"
>"Thats why I did all of this!" He gestures around himself
>"Those animals took my son, so I will take them all and turn them into nothing more than rugs and sex dolls"
>You're almost at a loss
>"Seriously?! Your son was a Pedophile and a murderer!"
>You're walking towards him slowly, each step echoing off the marble floor
>The preserved eyes of the pelts on the floor look to you for revenge
>It would be slow and painful
>"He was not! Some Anthro planted those pictures and killed him! He was a saint! You know! You were his friend! The Police even had the nerve to try to say you did it!"
>You're in front of him
>"the Police were right, Anthros didn't kill your son, I did" 
>Your helmet is still downstairs as your cold stare burns into his eyes
>"And now I'll kill you" you say as you hand slowly reach for him
>His shocked expression goes to one of smug confidence
>"You cant kill me or all your Furballs and everyone else here get vaporized"
>he taps his chest smugly
>"my pacemaker is set to the explosives down there, my heart stops so do theirs and so does more than half the ring! Those explosives are deep enough in the structure to blast a chunk of this station into space!"
>you frown
>"Now I"ll be going Anon, I would say it was good to see you, but it wasn't"
>You grab him "You can't leave or it'll set off all the explosives"
>He looks at you holding his arm "What are you stupid? If I go out a certain distance it stop sending signals, what you think I want to be trapped here?"
>You smile at him as he realizes his mistake
>"So if you're out a certain distance it wont set them off..."
>You fold his upper arm in half and tear it off
>"And I bet you have a handy escape pod too"
>A quick search of his desk (Which you notice is covered in a black foxes pelt) and you find a button which opens a book case
>Behind the case is a single man escape pod
>"NO Spare me! I'll do anything!"
>You usually love it when they Beg but this was different
>"I want my little sister back, the one your son murdered"
>>Browns eyes go wide in realization
>The control panel is set to return to the City,but after a few quick changes its set to a single space jump after 1 minute of floating after launch
>You snap off his other arm and throw him in and press the button for it to launch
>As the thrusters warm up you Punch the glass of the window causing it to crack into spider webs
>It wouldn't survive a jump
>You turn from the pod as it launches
>No need to watch it
>A quick walk to the elevator and you knew that it was over


Chapter 23: Resonance
>It's been three days since the raid of the Tribal's headquarters
>The news of course, had a field day
>'...Has RAID finally pulled it's weight? After a daring attack on a recently unknown topside military-'
>'Cell blocks in and around the area are currently over capacity from the massive influx of surrendered'
>'Hundreds of thousands of Anthros with confirmed kidnappings are currently being rescued, with many under the ownership of'
>'Get your damn paws off of me!' where senator's ... brutal arrest mid meeting. To see that some of our elected best'
>'Potential power play? Massive holes in the government are in need of new, honest members'
>You flipped through the various news streams on your holophone, all of them still buzzing about it all
>High ranking officials, Senators, CEO's had all caught the heat and were quickly arrested
>...If there was one thing for certain, Mr. Brown was a good record keeper
>Ledgers filled with business transactions that had the name of the anthro sold, the buyer and the price
>It seemed he had hoped that if he were captured he would have a bargaining chip
>Too bad you were the one who found him first
 
 
>"Aannooon, c'mon, stop playing on your phone!" Isabelle whined from her unending furry hug
>"Babe, the stream's almost on," said a more relaxed Jane to your left
>You're sitting on the couch wedged between your very affectionate girlfriends who haven't stopped clinging to you every since you got back
>Not that it bothered you in the slightest
>Especially with how closely they'd stick to you every night
>The two have their dual stream deck deal going for another one of their donation competitions, but through excellent camera work they managed to keep you intact
>"Now?" Izzy's almost perfected that begging whine of hers
>Almost
>"Just a sec," you laughed and stood up, out right dragging the wolf along with you
>She didn't have the tiger claws like Jane did, and with a few yips she was grabbing at your shirt while she fell back down
>Luckily the couch caught her
>"Just gotta fix something first," you explained, walking around their setup and to the back of the room
>They decided to make a cool armor stand of your armor, and they spent a lot of effort keeping the gloves bent upwards to act as a shelf of sorts
>A picture on it was crooked, and you just couldn't have that
>Not when the picture was an actual, real full color picture
>None of that hologram or screen shit
>When you and the rest of your tired, but safe squad loaded up onto the convoy it made it's rounds dropping people off
>You were one of the last few due to your house being so far away
>A quick nap solved the trip length
>Axel was the one who woke you up when it was your turn to go
>While a bit groggy, you didn't have to carry a whole lot of stuff, as you left light and came back the same
>Now, you don't really know how they did it, but the second your boots hit the soil the universe felt the need to send two flying balls of fur at you
>A flash of light accompanied your manly scream
>That cheeky dog Axel apparently was an enthusiast, and you didn't question if he or the rest of them planned thtis
>With a girl literally hanging to either arm you carefully accepted his gift, and the first thing you did was find a frame to place it
>You didn't want to think about what you'd have in store for whoever ripped that photo of you covered in furry arms, stuck in mid fall with happy teary-eyed smiles on either side
>So you adjusted it a little to the left, and it once again sat perfectly on your power armor stand
>"Perfect," you said when you finished fiddling with it
>"Are ya ready yet, babe?" it was Jane's turn to beg
>You turned around
>"Yeah, just ha-PPFTH"
>Black, woolly fabric splatted against your face, and seconds later it fell into your stunned waiting hands
>You lift it up
>"...Do I really have to wear this?"
>"Yes!" they both chirped
 
 
>That had been your life up to this point
>And living in the now you're once again squished on the couch with the both of them streaming like usual and occasionally cooing at their audience
>"Boyfriend Anon is a hero! He was part of the Tribal raid on the space side of the ring!"
>Isabelle's tail was wagging furiously, and every bounce she made on the couch it always reached your covered face
>"And you all thought he was a sex robot~" cooes Jane with her tail wrapped around your forearm
>Some excitable padded wolf paws were currently hugging your other neck, and with a pull you were brought in almost front and center
>She's also shaking you
>Violently
>"Oh oh! Anon, do that thing with your vents! We never got to show you off before! ...Well, not your face at least!"
>No dammit! Her big pink puppy-dog eyes were burning into your own
>You just accept it with a shrug, and assume a manly pose you definitely didn't steal from one of Isabelle's bizzaro weeb shows
>"Well, can't say no to that"
>The sound of air steadily rises as you pose for a few seconds longer, with palms open outward, thumbs tucked in and your hands on either side of your face
>When your arms still remained crossed in an X over your chest, you somehow charmed the chat into giving another "Awoooooooo!"
>Izzy squeals in delight and Jane couldn't even be mad with how hard she was trying to look calm at your goofy stance
>"Alright, now to get serious," you say as you scratch Izzy's head right between her ears
>You roll up your sleeves and tuck the ends behind metal that juts from your shoulders
>Shifting to the side you also make sure to give both streams a look
>With a look to either side, you see Jane and Izzy creep forward to see
>When they're in optimal range, you fire
>You clasp your hands together with a quick flex of your muscles and Augs, putting in a lot more effort than normal
>Immediately, steam shoots out of your vents with a 'Vooosh!'
>And immediately ruins the hair of both your slightly too close streamers
>Izzy took it light a champ, unfazed and still happy even with that rats nest of pink hair she now has
>Jane's hair bun lies ruined and limp on her head, and she's also leaning back far over the couch's edge
>She twitches a little when you poke her on her now exposed stomach fur
>A soft purring noise from Jane's computer quickly revives her
>"Thank you for the donation!" She happily cheers, alive and well and now sitting upright
>You sit with them for awhile, lazily watching them kicking the crap out of each other and giving the occasional pose on donation
>A while later, your Holophone goes off with a woof and a purr
>Erh, which one of them changed it from a simple ding to that?
>You stand and answer it anyways, walking into the kitchen just to hear whoever called you
>You peel off the slightly sweaty mask while Lt. Perun's image appears
>"Hi Anon! Wait! Don't worry, we aren't mobilizing again!" your almost frown goes back to neutral
>With a sigh of relief you change it to a friendly smile
>"Ok good, whats up?"
>The sound of beer was on your mind before, and the puma just made it worse
>With a single step you grab three from the fridge so you can crack a cold one with the girls
>"Col. Dregen's going to hate me for this, but I put together awards packages for you, Shaxx, and Alexandra!"
>Neat, free lootcrate
>You snap open a can and take a small sip
>"The three of you basically lead the charge through that fortress, so it's only fitting"
>It's probably only medals though
>"Oh yeah? Going to give me a little shiny metal thing I'll lose later?"
>She smiles with a 'I know something you don't know' smile
>Now you're worried when it upgrades to shit-eating
>"...What?"
>She's still smiling as she answers
>"Well, uh, it went a little further up the chain of command than I intended, and now the President of the Ring wants to give you an award"
>You pull an honest to god spit take that you'l have to clean up later
>"I- uh, what? Award? President!?"
>"What Anon? Something about a president?" Jane calls out
>"NOTHING," you yell back
>Perun's just as bubbly as Isabelle is on a daily basis, and she's actively bouncing in place
>"I TOLD you Dregen was gonna hate me! He isn't getting an award at all, and you're getting a Presidential Award of Courage and Valor!"
>You stand stoopified
>That's a pretty long name, and your curious how it'll fit on a shirt pin
>"Uh, wow I, yeah. I wasn't expecting this" you take a shakey sip of beer to poison the nerves away
>"So..." engage totally cool, calm and collected mode, "Is he, like, mailing it to me or something?"
>That smile of hers is going to get stuck like that if it get's any larger
>"Nope! There's an award ceremony next week! You and your girlfriends are being invited, and so are Shaxx and Alexandra! His people will be contacting you soon!"
>You wet the floor
>The can of beer rolls underneath the cabinet somewhere over another mess you'l have to clean up
>One of your Aug's twitches as well
>"I didn't ask for this! I just wanted to beat up some Tribals and get some sweet new armor!"
>Both of your hands are covering your phone, but you still have the foresight to not crack the thing
>"You never said anything about presidential medals!"
>"Too bad! You're getting it whether you like it or not!"
>"LOUD NOISES!"
>"Dang it Isabelle I'm on the phone!"
>"WOOOOOOOOOOO, how'd you like that!"
>"JANE, what the heck!"
>You nearly slip and fall on lake blackout on your mad dash over the tiles
>Somehow you successfully made it out the back door, and you're standing next to the pool holding a very amused, tiny Perun
>"Now then, don't make me send Private Williams again!" she's wagging a padded finger at you, "Or should I just contact Jane and Isabelle"
>That fuckin grin
>Your mind is racing at the thought of a short wolverine dragging you through the crowds
>It immediately halts when you think of Jane and Isabelle learning you turned down a medal
>"Fine," you sigh
>"That's what I like to hear"
>Her hologram winks out as you head back into the living room
>"Whats wrong love?"
>Jane is the first to notice you coming back into the room
>"I just got told I'm receiving a presidential award and that I have to go to a cerem-"
>"WHAT!? REALLY!?!" Jane squeals in happiness
>Both Jane and Isabelle pounce you and tackle you onto the couch
>'SUDDEN DEATH,' the tv responds
>And you thought you were strong, or at least combat savvy
>You've absolutely no idea how you're now sprawled out over the couch with two balls of fluff overpowering you
>THAT'S GREAT ANON!" one of them said
>Isabelle, you deduce, from the dark fuzz sitting on your face
>"I told you boyfriend was the best!" cooes Jane to her stream
>You get a breath in when Isabelle pulls you up
>She goes for the kill with a kiss
>"Best boyfriend ever"
>'HOLY SHIT!' spams the chat
>'Oops,' you say to yourself while in the flesh and maskless with a wide eyed wolf still locked in a kiss
 
 
>You're on a stage near the capital city, wearing a suit and tie
>The platform is near some kind of large field that you briefly caught a glimpse of from behind the curtain
>One of them is full of chairs and tables near this stage you're on
>You don't really acknowledge your name being called when you cautiously step in front of the crowd
>The sound of clicks and reporters talking fills the air while you numbly make your way center stage
>Standing there, Shaxx and Alexandra are to your left and right respectively
>The president of the Ring is giving a speech, or something that you aren't paying attention to
>You're only following the motions, your eyes never leaving Jane and Isabelle sitting at the front row wearing beautiful white dresses
>A hand on your shoulder snaps you out of it
>The man responsible for the world you've lived, bled, and fought for is smiling at you and bringing you forward
>It's an alright feeling, you guess
>"...And this man here, forged from the fires of poverty and strife who now stands before you. Today, he puts us all to shame. A shame that I will always hold. By my authority, I present to you this award that, in some form, may always remind you of the valor you've shown today"
>Fuck he's talking about you, keep the spaghetti in
>With your pockets only a bit saucy the President now stands before you, a medal is in his hands
>He leans forward a bit
>"Could you bend down a little son" he whispers as he looks up at you
>You can't help but smirk as you bend at the waist, and he slides the medal around your neck
>Definitely not a shirt pin
 
 
>It's been a year since you received your medal
>It, along with the other assorted bits of metal decorates your suit behind Jane and Isabelle while they stream
>A non lewd stream was on the menu today, and Jane took them very seriously when they arrived
>Sometime's she'd be a cam girl, and whenever you're roped into it the increased donations more than made up for it
>She's slowly been getting more sponsorship deals the more 'professional' her portfolio looks
>The mask went away too
>No point in trying to hide when one of your girlfriends killed the gag earlier
>When people put two and two together, the chat would go deathly silent
>The first few weeks you actively harmed viewership, and only the constant encouragement of Jane and Isabelle kept you seated on that couch when they did
>The chat got used to the fact that you were cool with it all
>The shitposting doubled from both sides after that
>Today however you weren't apart of the show
>Like the good Husband you are you're currently standing in the kitchen and fixing a meal together for the three of you
>"Anon, I have a craving! Can you make me Pickles and Vanilla ice cream?" Isabelle's voice floats in from the other room
>You smile and punch in a recipe you found on the extranet for just the occasion
>The machine whirs it out neatly in the bowl you set down, and when it was done you bring it out to the sounds of their streaming chatter together
>The only difference from the usual is Isabelle being very pregnant
>About eight months to be exact
>"Pause! Preggo wolf's gotta eat!"
>You place the bowl in her outstretched pawpads, and with spoon in hand she takes a bite out of it
>"Mmm Anon, you are a wizard with that BioDispenser!" she moans happily
>You catch Jane leaning back and pouting to her camera
>"Izzy gets waited on by Husband paw and foot and I get nothing!"
>The ring didn't care how many people you married, especially with how some Anthro species have polygamous relations exclusively
>You walk around the couch to Jane and break her pout with a kiss
>"You get anything you ask for love"
>Isabelle has already finished her bowl of pickled delight
>Yeugh
>"More please," she says with a doofy smile, handing it back to you
>You take the bowl and head back into the kitchen, with Isabelle happily talking to her stream
>"We have the Best Husband!"
>"Mhhhmm~ we do," purrs Jane
>The bowl of ice-cream gets factory made, you don't personally know how you'd make that
>But dinner you cook each and every time
>It was nice in a way; that simple feeling of working away and living a relatively stress free life
>You have to admit that you might've finally beaten the odds
>No
>The giddy memes and laughter of your two wonderful wives tells you otherwise
>You and everyone else has a much better life Around the Ring
