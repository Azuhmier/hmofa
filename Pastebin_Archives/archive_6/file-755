"Stuck"
Human/Fox reverse ntr (cuckquean)

>engaged to childhood friend, Kate
>she works for a massive company making great money - I'll likely be a stay at home dad
>fiancee constantly complains about how her foxgirl boss, Tina, is a huge bitch to her just because she's human, but loved shovibg the engagement ring in her face
>one morning get a call from her
>"hey baby, I just remembered I forgot a really important document I need at home this morning, could you come by and drop it off? Tina will have my head if I'm not ready for our meeting."
>grab the file and head over
>security stops me at the front - strange, since I've been by before to have lunch with Kate
>after a few minutes I hear a voice call out from the offices
>"Oh! You must be the fiance! I've wanted to meet you for so long!"
>I look up and see the most beautiful vixen I've ever seen - Kate wasn't kidding when she called her boss a "fox barbie"
>a tall, slim figure, curved in all the right places, with silky white and red fur and long hair only slightly darker red
>"Come in, come in!" She said as she wrapped an arm around my shoulder, leading me into the building, "There's something I've been dying to talk to you about..."
-------------------
>she quickly ushers me into her private office, taking a look out the door before closing it and drawing the blinds
>"Before I say anything else I just have to know...is it true?"
>"Sorry, is what true?"
> She slowly walked around behind her desk, almost making a show of shaking her ass and waving her tail as she did so
>"Well, according to Kate a human's - you know - is way bigger and smoother than anyone else's, she won't stop bragging!"
> "Well I guess I've never compared it but-"
> "Let me see it."
> Her eyes changed; where before she had been friendly and open, if a bit fake, now her eyes were intense, like she was trying to stare into you.
> I was about to protest, but she must've sensed my hesitation as she leapt onto the desk and brought her face close to mine, putting her hand on my shoulder to keep me in place
> "Let me be clear. Your fiancee is a terrible employee and if I wanted to I could have her fired in an instant. So show me if she's been lying. NOW."
> a bit frightened and a lot aroused, I weigh my options...there's nothing to be done. If Kate loses her job now all of our plans will be undone. We won't be able to afford the wedding, we won't be able to get a loan for a house, kids will be right out for at least another five years
> I have to do this
-------------------
> "Mmmm, I guess she wasn't lying after all"
> There I am, sitting in my fiance's boss' office, cock out and half erect, with her incredibly hot boss eyeing my dick like it's a prime steak
> "l-l-look, this is kinda uncomfortable. You got your view, now can I please go? I need to get this file to Kate"
> Yes, that's it, stay on task. Get out of the office, get the file to Kate, get out, NEVER COME BACK.
> She gave a small laugh
> "Oh, that? That's for me, it's already where it belongs. And you're not going anywhere unless you want to be on the street."
> With that she hopped off the desk and to her knees, sniffing my now very erect cock
> "Ooh, what a wonderful smell, I have to have a taste..."
> "Hey, wai-" I try to say as my cock quickly disappears into her mouth
> the pleasure...the way her thin rounded tongue wrapped around me...it was indescribable
> After what felt like it could've been five seconds or an eternity of this horrible pleasure I meekly cry "I'm gonna-"
> "NOT YET" she barked at me, eyes becoming wild and intense once again
> She practically tears off her top and panties and hikes up her skirt before straddling me
> "No, it's your turn to make me feel good now, there's no way we're turning back"
-------------------
> as much as I want to say I resisted, I just couldn't
> after holding back the whole time I couldn't contain myself anymore
> as she brought her perfect pink lips down on my cock I grabbed her ass and shoved her down, eliciting an audible yelp
> grabbing her hair and kissing her and thrusting wildly I lose track of time again
> this is wrong but it feels so good, and it's not like I had a choice.
> "I can feel you swelling up" she whispers as I approach orgasm again
> before I can say or do anything she grabs the back of my head and yanks back and down placing her face directly above mine, staring into my eyes as she tightly wraps her legs around me and gyrates
> "Jesus!" is all I can muster as I unleash the load of a lifetime deep inside her foxy cunt
> letting out a long sigh-like moan we both fall to the floor, exhausted, still connected at the groin
> after a few minutes of basking in the afterglow I come back to my senses
> "Jesus, this was a big mistake, just let me grab the file and bri-"
> I can't finish my sentence as panic rises in my chest
> I can't get my dick out of Tina
> Literally - it's won't come out, like it's been stuck there with crazy glue, attempting to break free only causes me serious pain
> "Oh, did I forget to mention?" Tina said with a sly grin creeping across her face. "My particular breed becomes, well, "stuck" to their mates for a few hours after sex. It must have totally slipped my mind!"
> In a daze, all I can do is follow her instructions and get her back behind her desk, with me stuck inside her
> "Now then, time to get back to business."
> She hits a small button on the desk in front of her and says the words that seal my fate
> "Could you please send in Kate for our 1 o' clock?"
