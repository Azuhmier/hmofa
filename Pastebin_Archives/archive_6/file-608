>You make your plans while you wait.
>You don't have to wait long, because apparently Andy works pretty fast.
>A slightly taller, brown and black Tika you remember as the spokeswoman for the audience you had earlier appears at the bars.
>"Hi human, I'm Charlie. Romy's on watch now, so she told me to escort you to see the Captain."
>Like Romy, Charlie is completely nude except for a holstered weapon at her side, and a few other tools suspended from her belt.
>Unlike Romy, she leaves her pistol holstered as she opens the bars and gestures for you to come out.
>By now you know the way to the Captain's cabin, so you and Charlie arrive in short order.
>Charlie motions for you to wait, then knocks respectfully on the cabin door.
>"Come," a voice calls from within.
>Charlie opens the door and ushers you inside.
>"Ah. Thank you for not making me wait too long, Anonymous. That will be all, Charlie."
>"Mum," Charlie says and withdraws, closing the door behind her.
>The Captain tells you to have a seat, gesturing to a thinly padded couch against one wall next to the desk.
>It's still more comfortable than your cell.
>"So, what's this deal?"
>Straight to business then.
"Well Captain, as I said, I can't open the security casket because I don't have the codes. But I can unclamp it from the cargo deck so you can move it off my ship onto yours."
>Captain Will leans forward, steepling her fingers in front of her muzzle as though thinking.
>"I can't say I'm thrilled about the prospect of putting a bomb aboard my ship. Why would I do that?"
"Because you're going to dump my ship over the side."
>Her eyebrows arch in surprise.
>"What for?"
"Because if your contact on Jaophus IV is who I think it is, I don't trust him and neither should you."
>"We've done business with him before. Why should I trust you more than him?"
>That confirms some more of your suspicions.
"Fair question."
>You consider your words carefully.
"You said it yourself, Captain. You don't know who he is. I do, and believe me, he's planning to screw you over."
>Captain Will sits back in her chair, regarding you thoughtfully.
>Her coat falls open, and you concentrate your attention on her face to avoid any distracting thoughts.
>"So I'd be stuck with a bomb, and no way to disarm it or get at the contents?"
"Not necessarily. I can get the shipping manifest from my ship's computer."
>"So?"
"That will tell us exactly where on Mytus VI the shipment was going. The receiving entity would have the keys and codes."
>"Hmm. And I suppose they'll just give them to me?"
"Not willingly. But maybe I can help you avoid a nasty fight to get them."
>The Captain's expression is calculating, appraising.
>You can't tell if she's making up her mind whether to trust you or deciding whether the security casket's contents would be worth the risk.
>"Why dump your ship over the side then?"
"So they have something to find. If I'm right, their reaction will be worth it. We just have to wait and see what it is."
>"If you're right."
>You nod, acknowledging the qualifier.
"I concede, it's risky. But a wise member of my people once observed that the risks and costs of action are preferable to the long-term risks of comfortable inaction."
>Captain Will nods. "John F. Kennedy."
>It's your turn to be surprised, that this alien woman knows the source of that quote.
>She's clearly a lot smarter or more educated than she lets on.
>The Captain leans forward once more, her gaze boring into your eyes.
>"So tell me Anonymous. Are you certain that the rewards of your proposal will outweigh the risks?"
"I am very confident that they will."
>The Captain keeps her eyes fixed on you a moment longer.
>"In that case, I believe we have a deal."
>Captain Will rises from her chair and opens a small cabinet, from which she takes a bottle filled with amber liquid and two glasses.
>"On my ship, we seal deals with a drink," she says, as she uncorks the bottle and pours some of the liquid into each glass.
"Should I interpret that to mean that you trust me?"
>"Guardedly, but yes," the Captain says, handing you a glass.
>The liquid inside has a smoky odor to it, and plays tricks on your eyes, seeming to change color under the lights in the cabin.
>"So Anonymous, what shall we drink to?"
>You think a moment, then extend your glass towards her.
"To trust."
>The Captain nods approvingly, a genuine smile creasing her lips.
>"To trust."
>She clinks her glass against yours and bolts the contents.
/It can't be that strong, if someone half my size can chug it./
>So you bolt yours.
>That turns out to be a mistake, because the stuff in the glass has a punch like a freight train.
>In the midst of your ensuing coughing fit, you hear surprised laughter coming from the Captain.
>"First time, Anonymous?"
>It's certainly not your first time, but you've never drunk anything like that before.
>The stuff is making your eyes water.
>You finally get your breathing enough under control to half croak a query.
"What the hell was that stuff?"
>"Lorellian Bourbon. I gather it's rare where you come from."
>It's not only rare, but illegal.
>Never mind the trademark infringement, the base intoxicant is nearly ten times stronger than alcohol.
>You feel dizzy, but lucky to have survived.
>And you suspect that you're not going to enjoy the after-effects, even as a pleasant warmth begins to seep throughout your body.
>At least your headache has vanished for the time-being.
>Captain Will takes your glass from you, and puts both glasses and the bottle away.
>"Come with me, Anonymous. There's someone you should meet."
"Okay, sure."
>Your voice sounds somehow strange to your ears as you follow her.
>Strange enough to make you giggle.
>You manage to avoid the door frame, but continue walking across the narrow passageway until you bump into the far wall.
>Strange, you could've sworn the passage was wider than that.
/People are strange, when you're a stranger.../
>The Captain takes you by the arm and steers you along the passage to another cabin door a short distance away.
>"This cabin belongs to my First Officer, Jenna. She's the one who brought you down, so technically she gets dibs."
/Dibs?/
/Dibs, fibs, bibs, cribs... jibs... nibs? Ribs!/
>This nonsensical train of thought causes you to giggle again as Captain Will knocks once on the door.
>"Come in, Captain," a voice answers smoothly from within.
>The Captain looks you in the eye.
>"Be nice to her."
>You manage to nod.
"Okay."
>Captain Will opens the door and ushers you inside.
>"Jenna, your prisoner," the Captain says, before shutting the door, leaving you alone with a white-furred Tika wearing red armor, and performing an intricate kata with a long sword.
"Hi."
>You give the Tika a friendly wave, but she ignores you, continuing with her kata.
"I'm Anonnymoush."
>You watch her movements, some part of your sozzled brain noticing how graceful and fluid they are, not a wasted motion anywhere.
"Are you Jenna?"
>"First Officer Jenna," she corrects you, not interrupting her kata to do so.
"Okay."
>She turns toward you, pointing the sword at your throat.
>"Okay what?"
>You retain enough mental faculty to correct your evident mistake.
"Okay... First Officer Jenna."
>You are rewarded with a tight nod, and the point of the sword sweeps away from your neck, finishing in a sword salute before she sheathes the blade.
>"Take off your clothes and lie down on the bed."
"What? Wh-what for?"
>Jenna glares at you, menace evident in her eyes.
"Alright, don't get excited... you want me to take off my clothes and lie down on the bed? I'll take off my clothes and lie down on the bed."
>You begin to disrobe, but it takes you longer than you think it should.
/I dunno, some people... ferrets... Tika, whatever. No patience, no romance, just get naked and lie down./
>You hope you didn't say that out loud as you finally manage to kick off your pants and climb up onto the bed.
>It's a little too small for you, your legs dangle off the end.
>"That's my desk."
"It is? Oh, sorry... Thought it felt weird."
>You lever yourself back onto your feet and cross over to the correct piece of furniture, lying down on your back.
>You hear a noise and turn your head to look.
>Jenna has divested herself of her armor, and now stands before you, nude, in all her sweaty glory.
>Species difference aside, a pretty woman is a pretty woman.
"Wow," you say appreciatively.
>Jenna climbs atop you, straddling your chest, and you feel the point of a small dagger at your throat.
>Pointy things aside, Anon Jr. has already come to attention.
>"Now, am I going to need this?" Jenna asks, showing you the dagger, "Or are you going to behave yourself?"
>"Oh, don't worry ma'am, I'll behave. Captain said to be nice to you, so I'll be nice."
>A smile creases Jenna's lips as she sets the dagger down next to the bed.
>"Good boy."
/What are we gonna do on the bed?/
>It's an old joke, and you hope you didn't say it out loud.
>Jenna lays down atop you and begins rubbing her body all over your torso.
>She rubs her head along both of your cheeks and across your throat, liberally smearing her sweat on you.
>Anon Jr. is definitely interested in what's happening.
>Jenna sits up on your chest, and you feel a moist paw rub roughly along your shaft.
>And just like that it's over, as Jenna hops off of you and puts on a robe.
"What, is that it?"
>"Yep."
>You're not sure what exactly you were expecting, but that wasn't it.
>But the Big Question clamors for attention in your mind.
"Why?"
>Jenna chuckles drily before answering.
>"Like it or not, human, you and I have one thing in common."
"We do? What's that?"
>"Neither of us is interested in dicks. Am I right?"
>It takes a moment for your brain to process this before it finally offers you an explanation.
/Jenna's playing for the other team./
"Oh, yeah, you're right. No interest in dicks at all."
>You reconsider.
"Except my own."
>You feel something sharp at your groin and look down to see Jenna with her dagger menacing your junk.
>"Reputation is everything Anonymous. I trust I don't need to explain what will happen to you if you impugn mine?"
>You get the idea.
"Duly noted. I get your point."
>You barely manage to avoid giggling at your joke.
>"Good. If any one of my crew asks, I rode you like a wildebeest. I trust I can rely on your discretion."
"Yes ma'am, First Officer Jenna, ma'am."
>"I'm glad we understand each other."
>Jenna sits in the chair next to her desk, straightening up the disturbance you created earlier.
>"Contingent on your good behavior, your arrest is suspended. You have the run of the ship."
>Jenna smiles at you.
>"Try to stay out of trouble."
"You can count on me, ma'am. Thanks."
>You give her a mock salute, and open the door and step out.
>"ANONYMOUS!"
>You stick your head back in the door.
>"Yes ma'am?"
>"Put your damn clothes back on!"
"..."
"Oh! Right!"
>You re-enter the cabin, closing the door behind you.
 
>======<
 
>The corridor was straight and clear of obstructions, and free of any of the ship's crew.
>Nevertheless, you weave unsteadily along it.
>You're no longer a prisoner, but you're not sure what to do now.
>At the moment you kind of miss your escort, since you're still three sheets to the wind, and an escort would be really helpful about now.
>You bump into a fire extinguisher mounted on the wall and excuse yourself politely before stumbling on.
>A door just ahead slides open, and a head topped with a frizzy shock of red hair emerges, looking up and down the corridor.
>"Oh, it's you!" Doc says, catching sight of you and brightening a bit.
"Yup, still me. Last I checked."
>"You're not looking so hot there, sport. Better come inside."
>With that, she seizes your wrist in a surprisingly strong grip and nearly pulls you off-balance as you stumble through the door, which slides shut behind you.
>"If I didn't know any better, I'd say you've been celebrating."
>You nod.
"Made a deal."
>Doc draws close to you and her whiskers twitch as she sniffs around your torso.
>"Oh, and I see you've met Jenna?" she asks, a smile creasing her lips.
>You nod again, and then hasten to add...
"She rode me... like a wild beast."
>Doc nods approvingly, licking her lips.
>"Well, that's definitely good news!"
>Doc gives you a hearty slap on the butt, staggering you and causing your coughing fit to return briefly.
>"Congratulations, kiddo! You popped your cherry! And just so you know, you're about to get a lot more popular on this ship."
"Gee, thanks..."
>"Speaking of," Doc says, locking the door, "how about that examination now?"
>This causes you to giggle.
"Do I really look that rough?"
>Come to think of it, you've felt better.
>Then you notice Doc removing her lab coat, which she carefully hangs up on a hook near the door.
"Ummm, is this the normal procedure for a medical exam?"
>Doc gives you a lecherous grin in response.
>"Yeah, it's the latest thing! Go on, you try it."
>With a shrug, you unfasten the collar of your tunic and pull it off over your head.
>Doc nods appreciatively.
>"Well, you certainly look healthy, I'll give you that."
"I work out."
>"I can see that," Doc replies, advancing on you. "Let me just check your muscle tone."
>With another lick of her lips, Doc raises her forepaws and plants them firmly on your midriff, feeling over your abs.
>Feeling a little froggy, you flex them and Doc develops a slight blush.
>"Oh, goodness, yes," she says approvingly, her forepaws roving around your waist to grope your butt.
"Er, what exactly are you trying to examine there?"
>"Trust me, I'm a professional."
>Doc fiddles with your waistband some more.
>"How do you get these off?"
>You look down and notice for the first time that you've put your pants on back-to-front.
"Ah, I understand your confusion."
>You turn in a small circle and reach behind you and find the fastener, finally allowing your pants to succumb to gravity.
"Ta-daa, nothing to it."
>"Oh, there's definitely something to it all right."
>She leans in close and takes a deep whiff of your crotch.
"Hey!"
>"Yup, Jenna's definitely been here."
>Doc encircles your waist again and presses her warm, furry torso against your leg.
>"So listen, in the interest of looking out for the crew's health, what say I take you for a test drive?"
>It takes a moment for the concept to leak into your inebriated brain that you're being propositioned.
>Doc is clearly several years older than Jenna, but at least her bedside manner is much more pleasant.
"What, right here in your office?"
>Doc turns you loose and goes to another door in the back of her examination room/office.
>"Ah, one of the perks of being the ship's medical officer, you see!"
>Doc presses the door control and the door slides open to reveal a small room with some medical equipment against the wall between two small but serviceable cots.
>Doc turns back to you, her lecherous smile returning in full force.
>"As you so aptly put it, ta-daa! Fortunately no one is sick right now, so we'll have the sick bay all to ourselves."
>She returns to you and takes hold of your arm once more, leading you to one of the cots.
>You stumble a bit, still having your pants wrapped around your ankles, but manage to keep your balance until she gently shoves you into a seated position on the cot.
>In a surprisingly smooth motion, Doc hops up into your lap, straddling your left thigh.
>The room spins a bit as her forepaws roam appreciatively over your chest and shoulders.
>She rests her weight on your thigh, and a damp sensation there makes its way into your consciousness.
>"So Anonymous, ever done it with a different species before today?"
"I can honestly say that I haven't."
>"Well, life is made from new experiences, they say."
>One paw slides up behind you neck and she pulls you into a sudden kiss.
>It's different, but not exactly unpleasant, as she grinds her hips on your thigh a bit.
>Doc breaks the kiss and begins peppering your neck and chest with kisses.
"So this is part of the examination too?"
>The room is growing slightly darker and feels more spinny.
>"A very....important...part...to be sure..." Doc replies between kisses.
>She raises her face to look you in the eye.
>"But enough shop talk. Let's get this party started!"
>She pushes you back onto the cot, and you feel her warm furry torso spread out full length atop yours.
 
>======<
 
>You wake up feeling like the floor of a taxi cab the morning after New Year's.
>Your mouth is dry, and your tongue feels like leather.
>Your head feels as though a very large puppy is using it for a chew toy.
>A soft, regular beeping noise filters slowly into your consciousness.
>You try to open your eyes, but the room seems insanely bright to you.
>That also doesn't do your headache any favors, and you groan in pain.
>Hangovers you've had before, but this is the pits.
>A slim paw touches your chest.
>"Finally returned to the land of the living have you?"
"Ugh... I almost wish I hadn't."
>You regret speaking, since that also seems to aggravate your head.
>"Under the circumstances, not surprising. Let me guess, the Captain gave you a drink from her private stock?"
>It takes a moment before your fuzzy recollections catch up to the question.
"Yeah."
>"Ah. I'm sorry, I should have guessed from your condition last night. A couple of quick questions - is 56 beats per minute a normal heart rate for you?"
>Keeping your eyes closed, you struggle to remember your field medical training.
"That's a little low."
>"Uh-huh. And a body temperature of 36 degrees, measured rectally?"
"Also low."
>Wait, rectally?
>Doc curses under her breath.
>"Dammit Will, are you trying to kill him? Well, I think I have just the thing for you. Hold still."
"Trust me, I don't wanna move-YOW!"
>A sharp pinch in your thigh causes you to yelp, more from surprise than pain.
>You turn your head towards the sound of Doc's voice, your eyes opening to give her a reproachful glare.
"That hurt!"
>She holds a small syringe up for you to see.
>"My own special hangover cocktail. A mild stimulant, some analgesic, and B-complex vitamins to get your metabolism working again. How do you feel?"
"Horrible."
>Doc drops the needle into a red container.
>"If I had to guess..."
>You see a tight smile cross Doc's face.
>"Okay, in all honesty, I have to guess... your natural metabolism is slower than ours, so that Lorellian Bourbon hits you a lot harder."
>You start to feel slightly better, so you sit up, rubbing your face.
>You notice that Doc has her coat on now.
"How long was I out?"
>"Nine hours. I stuck around to make sure you didn't check out."
"Thanks."
>"Don't mention it."
>You watch Doc as she shuts off the medical monitor next to your cot.
"Umm... did we..."
>The unspoken question hangs in the air as Doc sighs.
>"No, we didn't. You passed out," she tells you, with more than a hint of disappointment tinging her voice.
"Oh. Sorry."
>"Not your fault."
>Doc turns to face you.
>"And as much as I would like to pick up where we left off, the Captain left instructions for you to meet the Chief Engineer in the cargo hold as soon as it's practical for you to do so."
>Oh yeah, you had promised to do some things.
"Okay, just give me a moment to recover."
>Doc gives you a small smile.
>"So, what do you guys call yourselves?"
"Armored Service Couriers."
>Doc smiles in amusement.
>"I mean your species."
"Oh. Human. Homo Sapiens."
>Doc writes that down.
>"I'll see what I can learn about you in case you run into any more problems like that."
>Doc sets the notepad aside and gives you a hopeful smile.
>"So can I count on you to return later for your examination?"
"Yeah."
>Doc pats your thigh, high and inside, which immediately reminds you that you're naked.
>"Good man. I'll give you some privacy until you feel ready to go."
 
>======<
 
/Welp, it's time to face your future./
>That's what you tell yourself as you step into the cavernous hangar/cargo hold of The Serpent's Adventure.
>Your hangover accompanies you, though it's not so strident after Doc's shot.
>She definitely knows her business.
>"There you are!" Zoe calls brightly to you from the cargo hatch of your ship.
>Her unique coloration is visually jarring, given the current state of your mind.
/Must be a dye job./
>Zoe skips down to where you stop to wait for her.
>"I gotta say, locking down your ship's computer was a new one. None of the others did that. What happened to you anyhow? You look like you've been dragged backwards through a trash converter."
"That's a pretty accurate assessment of how I feel. Up late last night celebrating."
>"Oh." Zoe takes a couple of cautious sniffs around your midriff. "With Jenna?"
"Yeah. Among others."
>The reason for the First Officer's unaffectionate display of affection towards you is beginning to become clear to you.
>"That's cool," Zoe says with apparent disinterest. "So can you unlock the computer?"
"Sure I can."
>You enter your ship and make your way to the cockpit, Zoe following curiously.
>Along the way you notice that every compartment seems to have been gone over, many left standing open.
>You'll have to talk to someone now to recover the rest of your personal effects.
>You bat a couple of the compartments closed again so you don't hit your head on the doors.
>You seat yourself in the pilot's position as Zoe hovers nearby, which finally arouses your curiosity.
"Hey, I've been meaning to ask - most of the crew hardly wear anything except you. Why's that?"
>Zoe reaches up and grabs the hem of her top and pulls it up, unashamedly flashing you.
>"Because I'm the ship's engineer, and I work on everything. And I got tired of burning my tits on hot manifolds."
>Zoe's unabashed display actually causes you to blush slightly, but on closer inspection you can see that she has a couple of nasty scars.
"Ah... Duly noted."
>All the displays have gone to sleep to conserve power, but they quickly come back to life when you tap a key on the data entry panel.
>You then key in your ident code, 724651, and hit enter.
>Further displays come to life, displaying new information on the vessel's status and systems.
>"Welcome, Anonymous."
>Zoe starts slightly at the sound of the computer's voice synthesizer.
"Relax, it's just the computer."
>"It talks? Keen gear!"
"Alright, shush. Computer, display shipping manifest for current load."
>"Working."
>One of the displays changes to show an official-looking document, although it intrigues you now that some of the blocks on the form are left blank.
"Computer, give me a hard copy."
>"Printing copy."
>A slot opens up and quickly spits out a standard sheet of paper with the manifest printed on it.
"Excuse me."
>You reach past Zoe to grab the printout.
>"The computer understands what you say to it as well?"
"Yes, but keep quiet. Two people talking at once tends to confuse it."
>"Oh. Sorry."
>You turn back to the console.
"Computer, release cargo clamps for off-loading, 724651."
>"Command authenticated."
>Just one last thing to do.
>But you hesitate.
>Once you do this, there is no turning back.
>You take a deep breath and let it out.
"Computer, dereliction protocol, 724651."
>"Command authenticated. Good-bye."
>The displays in the cockpit dissolve into a random jumble of meaningless data before going blank.
>"Dereliction protocol? What's that?"
"It's a security protocol when the ship is considered unserviceable, due to mishap or capture. Basically it wipes all the core memory, except for the flight log recorder, which is on a separate core."
>"Aw, what'd you have to do that for?" Zoe whines.
>"I could have salvaged that computer and put it to work on our ship."
"It's a very limited computer, and for security reasons it's very hard to get at."
>"I enjoy a challenge."
>You stand up, folding the manifest, which you tuck into a pocket on your tunic.
"Never mind. Let's get that security container off the ship."
>"Sure! I'll get Jo to help." Zoe runs out to the courier ship's cargo ramp and calls for Jo.
>You head back to the cargo hold and over to the squat, blocky black shape of the MK4 Secure Transport Container.
>Just then the biggest ferret you've ever seen walks into the hold, and looks around curiously.
"You must be Jo."
>Jo looks at the sound of your voice, but turns away shyly.
>"Jo, we need to take this thing off and secure it in our hold," Zoe tells the bosun.
>"Oh, sure. Let me get a pallet jack."
"No need for that."
>You reach down and unplug the power umbilical from the side of the container.
>"What? This thing must weigh at least half a ton!"
"Three-quarters, actually, but because of that..."
>You open the control panel and activate the container's repulsor field.
>A blue glow develops beneath the container and it levitates slightly.
"We can move it now, slowly. It doesn't exactly track straight, and it can be a handful."
>"Neat," Zoe says admiringly, while Jo just looks at you and blushes slightly.
>You find her shyness kinda amusing, considering that Jo is as tall as you are and has a few scars, giving her a gruff appearance.
"C'mon Jo, you take that end and I'll take this. Be careful on the ramp."
>"O-okay."
>Between the two of you, you manhandle (Tika-handle?) the heavy container down to the Serpent's cargo deck, where Jo expertly stows it and gripes it down.
>"Jo is our bosun, she handles all the deck gear and small vessels," Zoe tells you.
"Thanks for the introduction."
>You can't tell if they take your sarcasm for what it is, but the moment ends abruptly.
>"Attention on deck!" Jo calls loudly.
>You turn off the repulsor field and look to see the Captain coming towards you.
>"Knock it off already, this isn't the Navy. So Anonymous, you done fooling around with your ship?"
"Yes. Here's the container."
>"And I can rig power to keep it charged," Zoe says, coming down your cargo ramp.
>You see that she has the power umbilical for the container with her, which she has cut off of your ship.
>"Good," Captain Will says, eyeing the container. "We're almost at the rendezvous point. Did you get the shipping manifest?"
>You unfold the manifest and show it to her.
"Yes. The receiving entity is Vindada & D'raang Shipyard, Tolan City, Mytus VI. The landing coordinates are here."
>"Good." The Captain inspects the manifest.
>There are a few things on the manifest that don't look right to you though.
>No value is listed for the insurance block.
>Another block that should show the name of the cargo's owner is also blank.
>The cargo description is "Data Processing Equipment", which is certainly not the sort of cargo you would expect in a MK4.
>"Jo, prepare Anonymous' ship for jettison. Anonymous, you'll come with me to the bridge."
>Jo snaps to attention, evidently a veteran.
>"Aye-aye, Captain."
>"Anonymous, what power does the container take?" Zoe asks you.
"Um, 36 volts, direct current."
>"Easy," Zoe says with a grin, and goes to get the parts she needs.
 
>======<
 
>After following Captain Will through a few unfamiliar passages, you arrive in the ship's bridge.
>It's about what you'd expect: a number of different consoles, manned by Tika who are intently focused on the information presented by their displays.
>Looking around at the displays and equipment, you are surprised to find that they connect with some memories from your military days.
"Is this a X'tixian ship?"
>"Yes. You know about the X'tixians?"
"Faced them in combat a few times. Giant cockroaches with really bad attitudes."
>"Yeah," Romy pipes up from her position at the ship's weapons console, "Crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside."
>Romy's description makes you feel slightly ill, but draws a wry smile from the Captain.
>"The Serpent's Adventure is a converted X'tixian Raider. Most of the equipment is well-suited to her current employment, though I wish their computer technology was more advanced. But we make do."
>The Captain turns to the navigation table, which is occupied by a youngish-looking, skinny Tika with a brown coat, wearing glasses and a colorful vest.
>"We've reached the rendezvous point Captain."
>"Very well Fifi. After we jettison the courier vessel, take us into the asteroids."
>"The asteroids? Um, sure. I can do that."
>Funny, she doesn't sound so sure.
>"We need to be able to watch the rendezvous discreetly."
>"Yes Ma'am," Fifi responds, pulling up a star chart with the asteroid field on her display.
>"Fifi is a stellar mathematician. She has to be, the navigation computer was damaged when we captured the ship."
>"Thank you, Ma'am." Fifi looks up and gives you both a shy smile as she crunches numbers with a pencil and paper.
>A comm panel beeps and the Captain presses a switch on it.
>"Bridge, Captain."
>"Bridge, Cargo. We're ready to dump the courier vessel."
>"Very well. Get it done."
>"Yes Captain."
>You are reduced to an observer, occasionally moving out of the way as one of the Tika squeezes past you in the densely packed control space.
>As soon as your ship is clear of the hold, Fifi quickly maneuvers The Serpent's Adventure into the asteroid field, turning it so that they can watch the rendezvous.
>"All stations, this is the Captain, power down all active sensors and secure external communications. I don't want them knowing we're here."
>"What about weapons?" Romy asks.
>"Optical targeting only. Turn the trackers off."
>Romy looks less than pleased with her orders, but complies.
"Now what?"
>"Now... we wait, and see if you're right."
>You hate waiting.
"And if I'm not right?"
>"Well," the Captain says, "the original plan was to space you, make the delivery and collect our fee. That's still an option."
>In the face of the Captain's matter-of-fact statement, the hunch you had now seems absurdly flimsy, though you had felt certain about it last night.
>"Time to rendezvous?"
>"Seven minutes, Captain."
 
>======<
 
>Seven minutes drag by with the weight of years.
>Then eleven more minutes do the same.
>You're starting to feel increasingly unsure of yourself.
>Romy is giving you a significantly hostile glance from her position at the ship's weapons control console.
"Are they always this late?"
>"They're usually pretty prompt, in fact."
>You swallow nervously.
>"Captain, energy field detected, ships coming out of warp."
>"Ships?" The Captain says, with particular emphasis on the plurality, her eyebrows rising.
>One moment there was nothing there except the faint speck of your courier ship.
>In the next moment, two warships suddenly appear, quickly decelerating as they approach the rendezvous point.
"Is that what they usually send to meet you?"
>"No," the Captain says quietly, "it certainly isn't."
>The Captain turns to Romy at the weapons console.
>"Can you make out any markings?"
>You already know what they are. You recognize the shape of the vessels.
>"Yeah," Romy replies, her voice tinged with venom, "they're Espos."
>Two Security Police Cruisers, in fact.
>Quite a reception committee.
>The two massive warships slowly approach your courier ship, and you see a small shuttle make its way from one of them to your ship.
"I think they're going to be pretty pissed when they find it empty."
>"I think you're right, Anonymous," the Captain says.
>She turns to the Navigation table.
>"Fifi, maneuvering thrusters only, take us down to the surface of one of the large asteroids. No landing sensors."
>Fifi gulps nervously.
>"Yes Ma'am."
>The Tika at the helm gets up and moves out of the way as Fifi takes direct control of maneuvering the ship towards a largish, irregularly-shaped asteroid.
>You keep your eyes fixed on the warships as the shuttle docks with your ship.
>"Captain, sensor sweeps, they're looking around."
>"Easy, the debris field should conceal us. Fifi?"
>"One minute to contact, Captain."
>"Quick as you can, please."
>The bridge falls silent, but you can practically hear how tense everyone is.
>"We can take 'em," Romy growls.
>"Too risky, and I would prefer not to tip our hand just yet," the Captain admonishes her.
"Those are the new cruisers. They're heavily armed and armored. If the Security Police are involved, this might go higher than I think."
>You REALLY want to know what's in that security container now.
>"Impact imminent," Fifi calls out, "BRACE!"
>The Serpent's Adventure touches down on the asteroid with a gentle bump.
>"Shut down all non-essential systems. Minimal power signature."
>"Yes Captain."
>The lighting on the bridge goes dark, as do some of the displays.
>You watch as the shuttle detaches from your ship and accelerates back towards its mothership.
>Romy is still watching you, the expression on her face unreadable.
>"Captain! Fire control trackers!"
>"On us?"
>"No Ma'am!"
>Your attention is riveted on the warships, and so you are very nearly blinded by the bright light that erupts from that direction.
>The Security Police warships have obliterated your courier vessel.
>"Yeah, they're pissed all right," Romy observes.
>"Temper, temper," the Captain observes wryly.
>"Captain, long-range sensor sweeps. They're scanning the area."
>"Very well. We keep quiet, they shouldn't find us."
>Several more tense minutes pass until the Security Police warships get tired of looking, or at least hanging around.
>"Captain, hyperspace insertion energy field detected."
>And in the next moment, both Cruisers are gone.
>You realize that you've been holding your breath and let it out in a long sigh.
>"Well well, Anonymous. It seems you were right about this so far. We'll make a pirate out of you yet."
>You're not sure whether that's a compliment or an insult.
>Some of the tension on the bridge begins to dissipate, as the watch standers express their relief to one another.
"So what's next?"
>"We'll lie doggo here for a little while longer, just to be sure. In the meantime... Fifi?"
>"Yes Ma'am?" the younger Tika pipes up from the helm.
>"Plot us a hyperspace jump to the Mytus System. Let's see if Anonymous is right about the rest of it."
>"Aye-aye, Ma'am. We'll be ready to make the jump in one hour."
>"Very well."
>Captain Will takes a deep breath and exhales, some of the tension draining away, then turns to you with a friendly smile.
>"Come with me. Let's get you some permanent quarters so you don't have to sleep in the sick bay again."
>It somehow doesn't surprise you in the least to learn that she knew about that.
