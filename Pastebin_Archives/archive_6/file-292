>Today's been hectic
>You've heard that humans are often sought out as mates by anthros, but this is ridiculous
>The moment you step out the door, and you're tripping on bitches
>The damn wolf twins from upstairs were sniffing around your apartment door
>Again
>They're lucky the door opens inwards and not out
>"Aw look sis, he's falling for us."
>You almost puked at how horrible that was
>"How quaint... Now if only he could lead us the way home. Maybe offer us a bone or two..."
>You don't have time for this
>"Ella. Emma. Fuck off." you say sternly, standing up and dusting yourself off
>"With you? Of course..." Ella responds, giving a seductive look while pawing at her groin
>Eugh
>After locking the door and ignoring their nonsense, you leave for work
>Not a few steps down and you've caught someone's attention
>"Hey there, skinny."
>The grey cat girl, Jannie
>Wearing nothing but a bathrobe
>Course
>"What's got you in such a hurry, sweet-stuff? Not gonna gimme a pretty smile before ya go?" she says with a smirk, resting on her shoulder against the door frame of her apartment
>You grunt and continue down the stairs
>"Pssh, you're missing out!" she yells down the stairs
>Just got to go through the lobby, nothing more can ha-
>"YOU."
>Jesus Christ on a pogo stick
>A big fucking bear is in the way
>AND she has completely bare
>"MAKE LOVE TO ME." she commands sternly, her voice vibrating the floor beneath you
>Fuck this shite
>After a half hour of tense negotiations, running, and interpretative dance moves, you finally worm your way out of the building to your car
>By the time you arrive at the offices, you're already late
>Someone's standing outside of your cubicle
>Probably to discuss your frequent tardiness
>"Hey, Anon. Ms. West called for you, she wants you in her office now."
>You've run out of negative things to mutter under your breath
>You enter her office, sitting down in the empty chair in front of her desk 
>A thick stack of papers obscure most of her form, only her head is visible 
>She gives you a cold stare behind the thin reading glasses perched on her snout 
>"Mr. Anon... You are aware that this is the tenth time you've been late this week?" she says 
>"Yes mam, I am." 
>Removing her glasses and setting them aside on the table, she continues her steely gaze 
>"Mr. Anon, I'm not sure what is keeping you from arriving on time, but in this line of work, I expect workers that respect their job, the company, and their fellow workers. Being late only tells me that you don't treat this position as seriously as the model worker does." 
>She closes her eyes and rubs the spot on her snout where her glasses once were 
>"By all means, you would have been fired the third time you were late. Not so many other administrators are so forgiving." 
>Subsiding her emotionless stare, she glances at the stack of papers 
>"I believe that you can make up for your mistakes, Mr. Anon. I have a... proposition for you, if you can want to call it that."
>She gently pushes the intimidating, heavy stack of papers towards you 
>"To make up for your late arrivals, I have two offers. You can either format and fill out all of these forms before you clock out. Or..." 
>She pushes the stack of papers to the side, revealing her torso 
>She's wearing normal, black business attire with a white undershirt and black jacket, the jacket not buttoned together and the undershirt revealing ample amounts of cleavage, with hints of a black bra peeking over the shirt 
>"We can discuss another way to... deal with this problem." she finally says, still giving an emotionless tone and expression despite the lewd indications
>"What would be your choice, Mr. Anon?" 
>Needless to say:
>You had to work overtime to finish the papers
>It wasn't until 11 PM that you finally returned to the apartment complex 
>The lobby and leading hallways on each floor are dead silent, each of their residents either asleep or doing something else at this dead hour 
>Upon arriving at your floor, you spot two furry bodies asleep at the foot of your door 
>It's the wolf twins 
>One of them has their paws down their pants to their groin 
>No wait, it's down the other twin's pants 
>Gross 
>Unlocking the door, thankfully without waking the sleeping twins, you step over them and finally enter your home 
>You hang your coat and take off your shoes, then place your keys on the counter near the door 
>A single light illuminates your home, shining from the living room 
>Softly, you walk to the living room, your socks reducing the noise made on the carpeted floors 
>A lit lamp sits atop a small table next to a recliner, it's back facing the hallway you walk in from 
>Over the seat, you can spot black hair and hear the sounds of soft snoring 
>You quietly walk to the front of the recliner 
>A shrew mole sleeps in the chair, who is no taller than the seat itself, and has a book laid face down on her lap 
>You bend over so your face nears her own 
>And kiss the side of her snout
>She awakes in a shake, rapidly blinking her tiny eyes before calming down 
>"Hey Mura, I'm home." you whisper
>"Oh, Anon..." she responds, pausing to yawn. "You're home late." 
>"Yeah. I had to finish up some extra work... Arrived late again." 
>"Again? Honey, you gotta..." she says, yawning once more. "...gotta get there on time... You don't want to lose it." 
>"Yeah, yeah..." you start, yawning in response to her own. 
>"Want to head to bed?" 
>"Nnn... Yeah." she murmurs, placing the book next to the lamp 
>You head to your dark bedroom, quietly undressing down to your boxers before lying down in bed 
>Through the darkness, you can see the form of Mura walk into the room, the claws of her toes clicking and clacking loudly against the wooden floor 
>Slowly, she makes her way to her side of the bed and climbs in, burying herself underneath the covers 
>A few minutes pass until you hear Mura softly ask, "Anon?" 
>"Mmn?" you grunt 
>"Do... Do you mind if we cuddle?" 
>"Of course, it's no problem." 
>Mura shuffles through the covers closer to you, stopping once her hair makes contact with your skin 
>You lay on your side and wrap your arm over her, pulling her close to your chest 
>Her soft hair, reminiscent of a large teddy bear, and warm body is soothing on your bare skin, easily warming you far faster than the covers could 
>The back of her feet touch your knees despite not being pulled back, her short stature still evident to you 
>Mura releases a satisfied sigh and quietly mumbles "Thanks Anon..." 
>Not more than five minutes and she's fast asleep again 
>Her rhythmic breathing pushes and pulls the fur of her back repeatedly against your chest, like a wave of calming, pleasant heat upon your skin 
>Your eyelids feel heavy as drowsiness overtakes you 
>And soon, you fall asleep, feeling much like Mura 
>Comfy, content, and peaceful
