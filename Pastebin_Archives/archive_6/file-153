A cold and very formal reindeer Holly Anon's supervisor hates Christmas as she doesn't have a special someone and all the Santa related jokes make her mood worse. There's a party at work and Anon drinks more than he should and certain truths slip out. Will Anon be under the mistletoe or under a toilet seat.

>Friday night it's party time
>You got invited to the annual Christmas party
>They were always shit but at least there's booze
>Finally you arrive in the office party room
>Seems like a funeral more than a party
>Everyone seems bummed out for some reason
>They you realise *She's* here. The frosty snow bitch
>She was always so brusk with everybody this time of year
>Everybody would laugh and be merry while she'll be acting like a school teacher
>Maybe it was all the Christmas puns she has to endure this time of year
>Doesn't help her name is Holly
>You spot her putting liter in a bin bag
>She acts like it's over and she's the janitor cleaning up
>You go over to the party pooper she drops the bin bag and looks you up and down
>"Mr Anon is it?"
>She talks like it's work hours
>"Yeah it is and hey, cheer up, its Christmas!"
>The fake smile didn't work, what a buzz kill this woman is
>"Yes. Thank goodness for you to remind me how could I possibly cope without you."
>It's sarcasm but it's better than nothing
>You go to the plastic cups and pour your self some drink
>You offer to Holly but she refuses
>You think to at least try to make the effort to talk to her
>"So any loved ones Holly?"
>"No."
>"..."
>"Err, how about friends?"
>"None."
>You weren't put off you were going to make her talk
>"So, you watch the big reinde- er! I mean game!."
>She scorns practically popping her eyes out at the glare she is giving you
>It will takes some Dutch courage but you can still save it.
>"Sorry you must be sick to death of puns and jokes, I didn't mean to offend, please forgive me
> Her eyebrows return from squinting at you and she actually has a faint smile on her cheek
>"It's alright Anon I'll just blame it on the drink, you can be very mature when you want to be."
>Mission Passed she's talking like a normal co-worker
>Some time passes and you've had a bit too much to drink you start talking and moving without a filter the chat was Holly was quaint and above board witch she seems to enjoy but now, things got more personal....

>Was it the drinks or something else you asked yourself.
>Could it be that you care about her even though she’s cranky all the time.
>Your mind tries to compute but with the alcohol in your body you can’t really think straight.
>You drink more and more till the room is practically spinning and your body is a joyful numb
>Suddenly everyone is your best friend and every song is your favourite
>You see her looking at the slow dancers in envy 
>You would never would have asked her to dance but in your drunken stupor you wipe your mouth, check your breath and drag your legs to the grumpy wall-flower
>"Hey Holly are ya jolly!." 
>You laugh hysterically at your own terrible joke
>Holly frowns and rolls her eyes and groans
>"I see you are enjoying yourself Anon." 
>She folds her arms brow beating you into submission
>But the alcohol in your body acted like a shield from guilt, you put your arm around her shoulder she recoils 
>"Hey come on Molly I saw you looking at them slow dancin' you wanna dance don't cha!."
>her voice is stern but her body language is saying otherwise, she's flustered but her shoulders relax and her eyes hide no malice behind her words
"Mr Anon, please, I am your supervisor you shouldn't be... acting this way towards me, what would the co-workers think."
>You take her hand, a mischievous grin creeps onto your face, as you walk onto the dancefloor.
"Who cares what they think Holly, relax, just enjoy the moment."
         
                     ______________

>Anon placed his hands on her hips there much wider than he thought they were
>She lets out a unexpected gasp
>"A-Anon your hands are..."
>Her protest mulls into submission, she places her head on your shoulder breathing slowly as Anon and Holly move back and forward to the low tempo music
>"Why are you doing this Anon, don't you hate me?."
>Her voice breaking her soft fragile voice vibrates in your right ear
>You feel sad for Holly, to use such a strong word as hate, sure she was strict and wasn't very bubbly but to hate!?
>You hold her closer and rock back and forth she seems so delicate like this, her tough guy persona has completely shattered
>"I don't hate you Holly, you're just doing your job, it's fine, don't beat yourself up about it."
>You words comfort her she she wraps her arms around your waist
>"Thank you Anon, I needed to hear that."
>You'd never seen this side of her before, you always thought she was more emotionally strong but it turns out she's quite self conscious about what people think about her.
>Her demeanor now is unknown, you never seen her this way in the workplace before, you can't help but be enticed by it.
>"You know Holly, I had no idea you were this cute." You thought it was the drink but it was your feelings that wanted to say that but if she responded negatively at least you'd have something to blame.
>She doesn't say anything at first, she looks up at you, and stares into your eyes
>"Do you mean that?, you're not playing a joke on me."
>"Well yeah I do but-"
Holly's lips stop you from speaking the shock of it almost made you sober up." But it ends as abruptly as it started.
>Before you can say anything else she takes your hand and you both move away from the party
>You walk further and further away from the party and stop at a storage cupboard
>"We left the party for office supplies?", You rub your head in confusion but Holly spins you around to face her
>"I thought... maybe, we could do with some privacy." She looks down at the floor after saying that, her face looks like she's waiting for a rejection any minute, you lean in and kiss her
>"You don't have to be scared Holly, I want this too. So just enjoy yourself".
>Her eyes soften and her head rests on your chest
>Thank god her antlers weren't big otherwise she'd be poking you
>She felt *your* antler rubbing against her thigh
>She blushes
>"I had no idea I could make someone do that, now you've made me blush bright red." Sounding embarrassed but also proud
>"Yeah isn't your nose supposed to glow red" not thinking blurt out
>"..." 
>Oh shit, looks like the ball ball's on the tree outside aren't going to be the only blue ones tonight.
>You wait for her to burst with rage but it never comes instead she laughs
>"Okay I'll let you have that one for tonight".
Her perky mood is so strange to you but it's also something you find irresistible
>You start kissing her passionately and with impatience
>With her free hand she opens the door to the storage cupboard and you dive in not breaking your kissing for a second.

                       ________________


>The storage cupboard is not too big but still small, there's not alot of room width way, Holly breaks the kiss, and looks around which last about a second
>"Umm this is a lot smaller that I thought it would be, hope that's the only time I say that tonight."
>You never seen her this playful, so relaxed with every word but you don't think she was drinking, it must be you bringing this out in her.


>"So how do we.." before you can say anything else she gives a cunning grin and turns her back to you.
>She slowly starts to grind her ass on your crotch
>The blood flows to your rising member
>"Don't think I don't see you stareing at this when I bend over you know."
>She's moves her behind up and down slowly, her tight skirt showing the round shape of her behind and curves, you finally whip out your erect cock and press it against her soft but firm rump.
>"You like my body that much?"
She slides her skirt down revealing nothing but her jucies sticking to her skirt, she bends down further, hands on the wall, excited but still a hint of nervousness, 
>"So shall we-AH!"
>You slide into her inviting pussy, her body twitches as he lets out a breathless moan
>I-I didn't know humans were so big~"
>You push further inside her her walls clenching tight
>You thrust faster, to enjoyment of Holly, stifling her moans
>the sound of your bodies slapping together and her gasps of pleasure become and her ass shaking at the momentum become too much to handle
>"H-Holly I'm gunna."
>Before you can finish you spurt inside her, you seed drips onto the floor, Holly's panting ceases as she puts her skirt back on.


>You open the door to fresh cooler air, you zip up your flies when Holly tugs at your arm.
>"Hey..." She holds her arms close, covering her chest
>"You didn't just say all those nice things to me just to sleep with me did you?". Her body language is timid and insecure.
>You comfort Holly as hold her, she buries her head into your chest.
>"Of course not, I really ment what I said, I think there's more to you than I thought, and, I wanna know more." 
>She smiles softly as you take her hand and go back to the party room on the lower floor.

>"Thanks Anon, I haven't *relaxed* in such a long time, I guess I'm just feeling vulnerable. Usually everybody wants to stay away and not touch me with a ten foot pole, I guess that's on my part..."
>"Why is that Holly." You instinctively wrap your arm around her walking like a couple she doesn't comment on it but you can tell she likes it.


>"I guess I got tired of getting hurt; My boyfriend cheated on me, it was around this time I found out actually, I put up walls to block out the pain but in the end I felt nothing, until somebody broke it down". She snuggles her head closer and you bring her in tighter.
>You think about what the other co-workers might think about seeing this but when you reach the party area all that greeted you was Henry-the Hoover.

>"I guess we were longer than we thought." Holly stifled a chuckle.
>Before you can chuckle the lights start going off leaving you in the dark the Christmas lights being the only light source
>"I think we better go. I don't wanna be trapped in a office with Professor Snape wearing a tank-top." 
>"Vare are Ze Detonators!." Holly smirks at her own bad German accent.
>Yeah, maybe she had a little bit of drink.


>You reach the exit and step out into the cold night air >you shiver and try to bury you hands as far as you can into your arm pits, Holly doesn't comprehend at first then it sinks in
>"Oh yeah you must be cold without having fur like me."
>There's a slience in the air amongst the howling wind
>Your both wondering what happens now, Holly is the first one to break the silence
>"So I guess this is it, it was fun..."
>She tried to be nonchalant about it but she's holding back the tears
>she must hurt as she goes back to her cold usual self
>"Yeah it's fine. I'm getting cold now so... goodnight."
>It's too late for that now, you know she's just trying to brush it off and push it down
>You see her briskly walking away, the sound of her boots echoing and fading away 
>you don't want her to leave you reach out your arm.
>"Please don't go."
>She stops walking and swiftly turns her head around
>"W-what?."
>You rush over to her you fingers like icicles intertwine with her warm hands,
>"I don't want you to go, I want you hear with me. Unless you don't want to then I won't stop you."
>She she's you shivering and she brings you in close to her chest.
>"I'd love too, I don't wanna go back to my empty apartment can't you read a woman's signal Anon?. I was worried you didn't want to see me so I was going to go home, but I guess you really did mean it, you really do want to know me." She smiles as she starts to let out a cry of happiness.
>You get some feeling back in your hands to wipe any tears away, as she kisses your cold lips and feel a warmth for her embrace like you had forgotten it was cold outside.
>"Well let's hurry I-I'm f-f". 
>"Freezing." She finished your sentence a childish smile and a arm greets your face and neck.
>You quickly walk your way to your apartment to the warm indoors
>Very, very quickly

>You open the door and change inside and close the door
>Holly not feeling the cold just causally sits on the sofa taking off her coat
>You go and turn on the heating, put the lighting on and get a blanket out of the cupboard.
>"Hey Anon are you that cold. You should probably buy a new heater, she looks around the apartment while turning on the TV, you grumble under your breath about Holly having a walking sweater surrounding her body.
>you arrive in the living room and sit down, your legs tired from walking but at least the cold winter air had sobered you up.


>"Hey Anon can I ask you something." Holly gets comfortable on the sofa turning off the TV.
>"Yeah what is it." 
>She paused before asking looking down at the carpet thinking about whether or not to say what she wanted to say
>"My old boyfriend. Leaving me at this time. It made me hate this year, this holiday. And so in order not to get hurt again I kept everybody out. But having you say, and do those things to me, I let my guard down tonight for you, you promise you won't hurt me, cause... if I can't love you, I don't want to love anymore." 
>She hunches over and buries her head into her arms, not saying anything you pounce on her. Holly is caught of guard
>You softly kiss her lips she closes her eyes in relaxed content
>You run your fingers the tuff of fur on her chest on her open button shirt
>She sit upwards on the sofa and brings her legs up not breaking the kiss
>She pulls you closer, you arms wraps round her neck,
>You finally break the kiss and cup her cheek in your palm
>"You have nothing to worry about; stop thinking about that chump, he didn't deserve you, so stop giving him the satisfaction of letting him control the way of how you feel, I love you Holly, and I mean every word I would never want to hurt you."

>She smiles softly to herself her eyes swell a bit before any tears flow, she brings you close to her face and wraps her arm around your waist and kisses your cheek.
>"You are too sweet to me Anon~ you should have perused me sooner. Now I can't stop thinking about *you~*" She chuckles
>She smiles and looks at you with her silver grey eyes as she grabs the blanket and covers you both with the beige blanket acting coy
>"I think you might be catching a chill, we better keep warm~."
>You smile back as you shuffle closer dragging the blanket over you, you rest you head on her fluffy shoulder trying to look at Holly eye's through her short white hair
>She takes a relaxing sigh as you eyes feel heavy after all that walking and so do you.
>the warm lighting of the room and the whirring sound of the heating warming the flat becomes the perfect white noise
>Your eyes feel heavy as Holly let's out a yawn.
"Merry Christmas Anon~."
You eyes close in bliss, the warmth of her body, the cosy feel to the dim lit room, you couldn't ask for a better Christmas present than this.
>You let out a few words from your tired yawn before drifting off to sleep snuggled up close.
>"Merry Christmas Holly..."
