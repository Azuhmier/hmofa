Chapter 1: Basic

"ALRIGHT FUCKSTICKS ON YOUR FEET! LETS GO LETS GO LETS GO!"
>You wake up with a start, falling out of bed and into line
>The drill instructor, lovingly named killhat john, angerly power walks to you
"WHAT IS YOUR NAME PUKE?"
>"ANON SIR!"
>He punches you in the gut, sending you to the floor
"I AM NO SIR! I WORK FOR A LIVING! YOU WILL CALL ME DRILL INSTRUCTOR OR SERGEANT! DO YOU UNDERSTAND PRIVATE?"
>"YES SERGEANT!"
"GOOD! NOW GET IN YOUR PT GEAR, WE'RE GOING FOR A RUN."
>This guy is always yelling or screaming
>Must have blown his ears out doing rifle courses or some shit
>Everybody gets into their PT gear (Which is some short shorts and an olive drab T-shirt)
>You're first to be dressed, partially due to the days you slept in late for school
>An anthro dog was having some trouble with his PT shorts
>He can't seem to get it above his tail
>You have an idea
>"Hey, you there, try putting them on backwards."
>He looks up at you and does so
>It fits perfectly and he smiles a toothy smile
>"Name's anon, what's yours?"
>He speaks in a thick german accent
"Mein name is Fredrich Halsturm. Nice to meet you."
>You hold your hand out and he shakes it
>The killhat comes back in and verbally assaults you for being out of line
"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING OUT OF LINE PRIVATE ANON! GET THE FUCK BACK IN LINE YOU SHIT EATING FAGGOT!"
>You do as you're told and you are walked out of the barracks to the middle of a field
>He instructs us to get in line and we do as told
>It's freezing outside right now and the killhat is in pants and a Tee
"ARE YOU COLD YOU SLIMY FUCKHEADS? WE'RE GOING TO FIX THAT REAL QUICK!"
>He orders us to start doing PT
>After we get warmed up, we go for a run, chanting the whole way

>7 weeks later
>Firing week
>You take aim with your rifle and fire into the target, hitting within the margins
>Not good enough
>You steady your rifle and fire again
>It hits the cross in the torso
"HOLY HELLBENDING DOGSHIT PRIVATE YOU GOT A BULLSEYE! YOU'RE STARTING TO IMPRESS ME PRIVATE ANON!"
>You steady your rifle and fire again, hitting the same hole
>The killhat is about to take back his compliment when he sees the hit
>It went through the same hole
"Holy fucking jesus private anon! You thread the fucking needle."
>He isn't screaming, meaning he's actually impressed
>You hear a click and ignore it, probably being a piece of gravel or something
>You steady the rifle again and squeeze the trigger
>The rifle barks out 3 shots and you flinch slightly
>The killhat grabs you by your collar and looks you in the eyes
"WHAT IN THE EVER LOVING FUCK WAS THAT PRIVATE ANON? ARE YOU TRYING TO KILL YOURSELF?"
>He looks through the spotter scope and shuts his mouth
"I take that back private. You just got a perfect grouping with that burst."
"DRILL SERGEANT! THE RECRUIT WISHES TO LOOK THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS!"
>He lets your lack of asking for permission to speak slide and hands you the scope
>You look and the grouping is 3 shots clustered around the left (your right) lung and heart
>You nearly drop it in shock
>You hand the scope to the killhat and he orders a cease fire
"CEASE FIRE! CEASE FIRE!"
"RANGE IS COLD!"
>He walks down range and rips your target off the stand
>He lets out a 'HOLY DOGSHIT!' and power walks back
>He grabs your rifle and breaks it down
>Looking for any fairies or other magic shit
"PRIVATE ANON! WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO THIS RIFLE? HOW ARE YOU HITTING TIGHT GROUPS WITH A TRAINING RIFLE?"
>"DRILL INSTRUCTOR! THIS RECRUIT HAS DONE NO MODIFICATIONS TO HIS STANDARD ISSUE RIFLE!"
>He puts it together and power walks back to the ammunition station
>He argues with the gentleman behind the counter and grabs an older rifle without an optic on it
>Oh fuck he got the defective rifle
>He throws it in your arms
"NOW GIVE ME A GOOD GROUPING YOU FUCKSTICK!"
>You take aim and steady myself
>Breath in
>Breath out
>BOOM
>It slams into the new paper target and hits just off center
>You adjust and fire again, hitting it dead center
>He stands there, mouth agape
>You clear and field strip the rifle to check it
>Everything is slathered in grease and the rifling is almost non existant
>It's an A1 model rifle that looks like it's seen better days
>You put the rifle back together and present it to the killhat
>He takes it back and lets out an angry grunt
>He drops the rifle at the ammo station and starts yelling at the poor guy behind the counter
>When he comes back, he lifts you up by your arm and drags you to the longer range portion of the range
>He slaps a small target in your chest
"GO SET THAT TARGET UP PRIVATE! I WANT TO SEE HOW YOUR MARKSMANSHIP HOLDS UP AT RANGE!"
>"AYE DRILL SERGEANT!"
>You do a jog down to the 400 yard line and wave your hands
>He screams 'THAT'S GOOD!' and you hang it up
>You jog back and he hands you a large weapon
>A fucking M240 with an optic
>You shitting me.jpg
"HIT THE DIRT PRIVATE!"
>You hit the dirt and open the top of the weapon
>He hands you a large belt and you load the weapon with no issue
"SHORT BURSTS PRIVATE ANON! NONE OF THAT SPRAY AND PRAY BULLSHIT!"
>You unfold the bipod and take aim
>You click the safety off and let out a short burst
>2 rounds fly towards the target and slam into the target
>They hit within 1 inch of each other
>The killhat is sitting there with his mouth open
"IT'S A MACHINE GUN PRIVATE! LIGHT THAT FUCKER UP LIKE YOU GOT A PAIR!"
>You take aim and squeeze the trigger, letting off 6 rounds
>They fly to the target and impact within the target zone
"Holy jesus private! You trying to get in my pants?"
>You smirk at that and fire off another burst, all hitting the target
"LET HER RIP PRIVATE! YOU HAVE ABOUT 70 ROUNDS LEFT TO FUCK THAT TARGET'S DAY!"
>You steady the weapon and let it rip
>RATATATATATATATATATATATATA
>All rounds stay within the target as you control the beast of a weapon with difficulty
>RATATATATATTATATATATATAT CLICK
>"OUT!"
>The barrel is steaming and the drill sergeant is staring at it
"Holy christ private. You just might make a good marine some day."
>You smile at that and clear the weapon
>The killhat carries the M240 back to the ammo station and retrieves an older model
>An M240B
"THIS IS YOUR RIFLE FROM NOW ON PRIVATE ANON! YOU WILL LOVE IT AND CARE FOR IT LIKE YOU WOULD YOUR GIRLFRIEND! DO YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND PRIVATE ANON?"
>"DRILL SERGEANT! THIS RECRUIT IS IN A RELATIONSHIP!"
"WHO ARE YOU IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH PRIVATE?"
>"MY RIFLE DRILL SERGEANT!"
"GOOD! NOW GET YOUR ASS BACK TO THE BARRACKS AND STRIP YOUR WEAPON!"

>30 minutes later in the barracks
>You sit next to fredrich and teach him how to field strip his rifle
"Anon, how are you so gut at shooting your rifle?"
>"That's a pretty long story, do you have time?"
"Ja, I do."
>"Well...."

>11 years ago: Papa Anon's ranch
"No anon! You need to breath out and shoot while you're breathing! Don't hold your breath."
>You do as you're told and load another cartridge in the old martini henry
>Breath in
>Breath out
>BOOM
>You score a direct hit, sending the can flying in the air
>Papa slaps you on the back and ruffles your hair
"Nice shot son! Load another round and fire at that can all the way back there."
>You adjust the sights to 500 yards and get down on your stomach
>You open the breach and slide another round in
>After closing the breach, you settle the sights on the barely visible can
>Papa positions your arms and the rifle seems to steady itself
>You hold that pose and breath in
>Breath out
>BOOM
>It goes left an inch
>You fling the breach open and slide another round in, taking the same pose as last time
>Breath in
>Breath out
>BOOM
>The can explodes into twisted scrap metal and water
>Papa scoops you up and pulls you into a bear hug
"That's my boy anon! You learn so fast!"
>You smile and hug your papa back
>He sets you down and grabs your hand, walking back to the house
>While you walk back, you notice that it's gotten really late and the sun is going down
>Papa starts walking faster and so do you
>Papa says there's monsters outside after dark
>Papa doesn't lie
>When you get to the house, papa and you are almost sprinting back
>It's barely light out and the tall trees block out the sun in your ranch
>Before you and papa get inside, you hear a whispering and then a loud screech
>Papa seems to perk up when it happens but doesn't acknowledge it
>Rather, he seems to just try to unlock the door faster
>You look back and see a pair of emerald green eyes in the distance
>Pain and suffering
>The eyes pulled you into them as you began to cry
>Papa pulled you back and threw you in the house, jumping inside and locking the door
>He locks the deadbolt and puts the bar in front of the door
>He also closes the motorized window bars
>He seems to relax a bit until someone knocks on the door
>You go to answer it, maybe it's the mailman!
>Papa pulls you back and grabs a shiny bullet, taking the rifle from you
>He slides the round in and takes aim at the door
>You run back to his bedroom and grab grandpa's old M1 garand loading a fresh clipazine in it
>The knocking stopped and he relaxes a bit
>After about 10 minutes of staring at the door, he walks over to the couch and pulls out the bed
>You grab your stuffed deer toy and hop on the bed with papa, who's still aiming at the door
>Papa gets up and closes all the curtains and blinds, completely blocking off the living room from any light
>He calls you to bed and you hug your deer close
>Bambi always kept you safe
>You fell asleep not long after being tucked in, dreaming of running through a field full of deer
>When you woke, papa was gone, leaving a note and grandpas rifle by the door, with the full supply of ammo
>The note read:
Dear anon,
I am going out to look for your mother, as she hasn't come back yet. If I'm not back by 1:00 PM call the police and tell them there was a bear attack. Make sure to use air quotes around bear attack so they know what I mean. If they don't find me and your mother comes home, take care of her and don't go looking for me by yourself. There are things around the woods that are evil and wicked. Do not look at any green eyes in the distance and DO NOT answer the door past 7:00 PM.
Love, Papa anon
>You check the time and it's 11:50
>After loading grandpa's rifle, you play with your stuffed deer toy and wait for an hour
>Papa comes back, looking like he was mauled by a bear
>He looks at you and smiles before wincing in pain
>You grab the medical kit and he patches himself up

>Back in the present
>"Thought my papa was dead until he pulled a miracle out of his ass. I did my best to help him and he was stable, but he only talked about it once when he was extremely drunk."
"Zat's...terrifying. Vell, at least you learned to shoot! Zat's a plus."
>"Thanks Fred. Hey, do you need any help with the oil? You're using a bit much."
"SCHEISSE!"
>He scrambles for a paper towel and wipes the excess oil from the bolt
>After cleaning your machine gun, you put it back together
>"DONE DRILL SERGEANT!"
>He walks over to you and grabs the weapon
>After function checking it, he hands it back to you
"JESUS JUMPING CHRIST PRIVATE ANON! YOU JUST PUT THAT WEAPON TOGETHER WITHOUT ANY TRAINING AT ALL? HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS PRIVATE ANON? ARE YOU A DIRTY CHEATER? DO YOU HAVE THE DEUS EX MACHINA ON YOUR SIDE? ARE YOU A MARY SUE?"
>You hold up the manual and open to the field stripping page
>"DRILL SERGEANT! THIS RECRUIT USED THE MARINE ISSUE INSTRUCTIONS TO DISASSEMBLE AND REASSEMBLE THIS WEAPON! THIS RECRUIT FOLLOWED THE INSTRUCTIONS TO THE T DRILL SERGEANT!"
>He looks at the manual and back to you
"HOLY DOGSHIT A MARINE WHO FOLLOWS INSTRUCTIONS! THE REST OF YOU COULD LEARN A THING OR TWO FROM PRIVATE ANON HERE! GET YOUR WEAPONS CLEANED AND ASSEMBLED BY LIGHTS OUT!"
"AYE DRILL SERGEANT!"

Week 12: Final day of marine week
>Fredrich and you have bonded so well, it's almost impossible to separate you two
>But you were sitting in the middle of the barracks, awaiting assignments
"Riley, 7th marines, rifleman. You're going to afghanistan."
>He looks at you next
"Private anon, 1st marines, machine gunner. Congrats, you're going to afghanistan."
>He looks at fredrich
"Private fredrich, 1st marines, Rifleman. You're off to afghanistan."
>Fuck yeah

Chapter 2: In country
>2 weeks after graduation day
>You and fredrich are on board a C-5 galaxy on your way to afghanistan
>The crew chief handed out cheap headphones so he could talk over the noise
"Alright, we're doing this briefing in the air because even the airport is a hot zone. You're headed to afghanistan, to fight in a war that could mean the difference between the freedom of anthros or the oppression of them in the middle east. The folks back home have taken to calling it the 'anthro liberation war' or something akin to that. When the doors on that plane open, you get the fuck out within 5 minutes or you're going for a ride across the atlantic again. Understood?"
"YES SERGEANT!"
"Good, any questions."
>You raise your hand
>"Should we form a perimeter around the plane or the airport?"
"Form one around the airport first, then you can ask for your assignments."
>A red light appears and we touch down on the tarmac
>The doors start opening and we see the plane still in motion
>The plane screeches to a halt and the light turns green
>You grab your gear and drag fredrich along with you
>He was your loader and you weren't going to manhandle this thing AND it's ammo yourself
>The plane is already rolling again by the time you get out and once the marines are clear, the plane raises the ramp and takes off again
>When it does, the galaxy goes almost vertical, belching flares and chaff as a missile streaks behind it
>You don't stop to admire it, however, as you needed to get to the perimeter
>Fredrich and the rest of your platoon followed as you ran towards the entrance to the airport
>There was gun fire and one of the bunkers had an empty tripod on it
>Jackpot
>You and fredrich set the M240B on the tripod and load it with tracer rounds
>After you get the weapon loaded, you start letting off bursts about 300 yards out
>"FRED! GET YOUR GLASSES OUT AND TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE SHOOTING!"
>He continues to feed your machine gun as he looks through his binoculars
"ARE ZOSE GOOTS?"
>Goats?
>You stop firing and take a look for yourself
>Sure enough, there were goats in the distance holding weapons and taking potshots at your new checkpoint
>Aren't we here to free the anthros?
>You put the binoculars back in his pouch and flip up your sight, setting it for 300 yards
>Once set, you lock the gun into a fixed elevation and start firing bursts down range at the goats
>Your platoon have taken cover behind the sandbags making up the bunker, laying down fire at the attackers
>The platoon sergeant loads a 40 mike mike and asks for range
>"300 YARDS SARGE!"
>He adjusts the rifle and sets it down like a mortar
>He fires it and you watch as the 40 mil gets smaller and smaller
>It lands on the goat's position, completely demolishing the small hut they were firing from
>The M240 gunner to your right is firing wildly, obviously not having any training on the weapon whatsoever
>God damn army faggots
>Fredrich is looking through the binoculars again
"ZERE ARE TWO RUNNING TOWARDS US! 250 YARDS UND CLOSING!"
>You adjust the tripod and let out a small burst, felling one of the goats
>The other, a man in a bunch of towels, fired wildly at your bunker
>One of the rounds slams into the gas regulator for your machine gun
>You didn't notice until it started firing faster and recoiling harder
>It went from RATATATATATAT to BRRTBRRTBRRT in about a half a second flat
>This sent 15 rounds streaming at the man, tearing him in half from the shear force of over a dozen 7.62 rounds hitting him at once
>The marksman picked off the remaining hadji and the only sounds heard were the sounds of aircraft landing and taking off
>After the fighting is over, you unhook the machine gun from the tripod and inspect it
>The barrel was steaming and you saw an AK round stuck in the gas regulator
>You grabbed your leatherman and dug the bullet out of the poor machine gun and let it fall to the floor
>"Fuck, gonna need a new gas tube."
>You unload the weapon and set it on the tripod to cool off
>A first lieutenant comes stomping over, obviously in a bad mood
"WHO THE FUCK ORDERED YOU TO OPEN FIRE? WHY DID YOU OPEN FIRE ON UNARMED CIVILIANS?"
>He's a gruff looking wolf
>Oh god it's captain america
>You raise your hand, deciding to take one for the team
>"SIR, I ORDERED THE SQUAD TO OPEN FIRE! THEY BEGAN FIRING AT MY MEN AND I TOOK ACTION, RETURNING FIRE!"
>You grab the AK bullet that was lodged in your gas plug
>He looks it over and growls
>Fredrich growls back but you stop him from going forward
>"Not worth it."
"WHAT IS YOUR NAME PRIVATE?"
>"PRIVATE FIRST CLASS ANON SIR!"
"THEN PRIVATE, YOU ARE GOING TO GET YOUR WEAPON REPAIRED AND REPORT TO MY OFFICE FOR PUNISHMENT!"
>Fuck

>Lt.'s office about 15 minutes later
"How long you been in country son?"
>"In country? What's that mean sir?"
>He looks at you funny and then snaps to a look of understanding
"You must be one of the new recruits here to take the place of the 5th that got hammered."
>"Yes sir."
"So tell me, Private anon, tell me why you would open fire on unarmed civilians."
>You feel confused
>"Sir, I believe they were in fact armed, due to the fact they were firing on your men in the checkpoint. One of your 240 gunners abandoned his post, which we took over and began to return fire on the hostile elements. The marines opened fire as soon as I gave the order sir."
>He looks at you and smirks
"I don't buy it."
>"Well what do you want me to say sir? That I should have just sat there and waited for even more backup? With all due respect, your forces at the checkpoint couldn't hit the broadside of a barn from inside the barn. They had absolutely no idea how to properly fire the weapon and just emptied belt after belt into nothingness. I don't feel I was in the wrong to take out the threats before they became a bigger threat."
"Were they anthros?"
>"Yes sir, most of them were anthro goats of some description. I held fire until the fired at us, just like the briefing said."
>He is about to say something when Fredrich comes in huffing and puffing
"ZEY ARE BACK MEIN FREUND!"
>Almost on cue, mortar fire started falling on the base
"GET TO THE CHECKPOINT AND KEEP YOUR HEADS DOWN! I DON'T WANT ANYMORE DEAD SOLDIERS TODAY!"
>You nod and haul ass to the barracks
>You grab your gear and put on your carrier rig
>After you grab some boxes of ammo, you run to the M240 that Fred has already set up
>It's the afternoon and he's already loaded the weapon
>You mount it
>"What's the range?"
"About 900 yards."
>Fuck
>You sight the weapon in and adjust the tripod
>You see the marksman up on the control tower
>"Sarge. Does our marksman have the range for the shot?"
"Yeah, they're just in range of the M25."
>"Can you tell him to open up when I fire? Going to drive them to a position he can pick them off in."
"Sure thing anon."
>He pulls out his radio and relays the info you gave him
>The marksman gives a thumbs up in response
>You waited for them to get closer as mortar fire pounded the base
>You hear a crash and thud as something falls through the roof
>You look down to see a fucking dud round at your feet
>Lucky me
>You grab it out of the ground and go out to the front gate
>You start spinning and do a discus throw and the mortar round goes sailing into the desert
>Before detonating on impact
>You go back to your bunker and watch the hadjis
>They continue walking and you open fire when they hit 700 yards
>Well within the M25's point target range
>The sound of machine gun fire echoed throughout the desert as you continued to fire bursts at the unlucky sand men
>They returned fire in the general direction but they don't have the range to put down fire on your squad
>They attempt to find cover, but the M25 starts picking them off as they sit behind cover
>The cheeky fucks start stacking the bricks to block his fire
>Not on your watch
>You dial in your weapon and pat Fred on the shoulder
>He nods and you let the weapon rip
>A hail of 7.62x51mm nato brand freedom tore threw the air towards the shitty cover
>It started to disintegrate their cover and the goat fuckers behind it
>Your belt ran dry and he grabs a new one, loading it in the gun
"UP!"
>You continue to destroy the shitty cover with full automatic fire until it's all but destroyed
>The marksman radios back that he can't see any more activity behind the walls and you hold your fire
>Mortar rounds are still going off around you as you wait for the dust around the walls to clear
>When it does, there's nothing
>Only blood and dust remains
>And a few scattered limbs
>You see the marksman lose his lunch at the sight and said lunch lands directly on an officer's head
>You snort out a laugh and continue to watch for movement
>Nothing
>The mortar rounds have stopped and you can finally relax
>The whole firefight lasted about 2 hours and you had expended about 300 rounds of ammo
>All in all a good day's work
>After cunfuckulating with the barrel, you swap it out for a fresh one and detach it from the tripod
>"You wanna carry this thing around Fred? Or are you fine with it being on a bipod?"
"Bipod please."
>You nod and grab a box of ammo for later
>"Hey sarge, you think we could go on a search party for those mortars?"
"Only one way to find out."

>About 30 minutes later
>Your sergeant walks back with a smug look on his face
>"What'd he say?"
"We're go to launch a counter offensive into the village. He says that anybody, anthro and human, with a weapon is considered hostile. We can engage at any time, but we don't have to. I'd say the ROE is give women, children, and elderly a chance to put the weapon down."
>You nod and grab the 240
"Oh and anon."
>"Yeah?"
"You're leading this attack corporal."
>"Corporal? What?"
"The Lt. was so impressed with your ability to coordinate an effective defense that he gave you a promotion to corporal. He says you would have gone straight to sergeant, but there's too much red tape nowadays."
>You smile
>A bigger paycheck is always welcome
"You're also going to be leading 2 other men in your new fire team."
>"Wait what? I can't lead anybody! I don't even know how! I'm not an NCO!"
"That's not what I saw half an hour ago."
>You were about to retort when you thought a bit
>You did kind of take charge of the situation
>But that's different! You're just a bit of a control freak and everyone just listened for some reason
>Your train of thought is interrupted by your sergeant
"Anon, the rest of your fire team is waiting in the barracks, your fire team's name is Foxhound."
>Foxhound
>It sounds vaguely familiar, but you brush it off
>"Thanks sarge, I'll go meet with the rest of the team."
>You and Fredrich walk over to the barracks to meet the rest of your fire team
>You discover why it's named Foxhound
>2 anthro foxes were almost tripping over themselves to get their gear on
>One of them spots you and stands at attention
>What the fuck?
>The other quickly follows suit
>Double what the fuck
"SIR! PRIVATE AUSTIN AND PRIVATE WILSON REPORTING!"
>He gives you a crisp salute
>"Put your fucking hands down boys, I'm not an officer. I'm your fire team leader and I came to check if you were mission ready."
>They shrank away at hearing you weren't an officer and their ears folded back
"S-sorry, we're fresh out of bootcamp."
>"What the hell kind of drill instructor teaches you to salute an NCO?"
"Anon, I think zhey are army."
>Maximum what the fuck achieved
>"Alright, I really don't give a rats ass about any of that. Are you riflemen or do you have different roles?"
"I'm a snipe-OOF!"
"He's a designated marksman who gives himself too much credit."
>You shake your head
"I'm his spotter. Well a grenadier, but I spot for him when I'm not shooting shit. Name's Wilson, and that jittery fuck is Austin."
>You look over in time to see Austin drop his rifle and pick it back up in a hurry
>God dammit
>"Well, let's go and ask what we're going to use to get to town. I'm sure as hell not walking 5 miles to kill some goat fuckers."
>The 2 foxes perk up at this and you turn around to head out
>Sarge is standing there trying to hold in a laugh
>"Sarge, I met the rest of my team. Are we requisitioning some transport into the town?"
"Yeah anon, follow me and I'll show you our rides."
>You follow sarge and he leads you to a monstrosity on wheels
>It looks like a mack truck had hot sweaty dumpster sex with an APC and a minesweeper got in on the action half way through
>A fucking MRAP
>Rather, MRAPs
>There were 4 of them waiting in the vehicle bay
"These are our chariots gentlemen."
>You were hoping for a humvee
>Humvees are fucking rad
>But a Cougar H works as well
>They had frag 6 kits and 50 caliber machine guns in the turret
>Nice
>"So which one am I driving?"
"The one in the rear."
>You look over and are incredibly disappointed
>It looks like it ran over a mine
>Or three
>Your team followed as you went to inspect your new vehicle for serious damage
>After looking over it for a few minutes, you hop inside and accidentally sit on the keys
>Once you fish them out from under your ass, you stick the key in the lockout and flip the switch upwards to start it
>The engine protests but after cranking for a solid 15 seconds, it belches smoke and roars to life
>At least it starts and runs
>While you were inspecting your vehicle, the rest of your squad already mounted up
>You wave your team into the MRAP and they look at you expectantly
>"WHAT? DO YOU FUCKS NOT KNOW HOW DOORS WORK?"
>Fredrich runs over to the passengers side and climbs onto the gun, while Austin and Wilson open the back and get in the rear
>Once inside, they latched their seatbelts and you slam the gear knob into drive
>The convoy is already ahead of you
>Fuck
>You step on the gas and smoke spews from the exhaust as you accelerate your freight car of a vehicle
>You follow your squad as they go past the checkpoint
>Well, guess you're in country now

Chapter 3: Leadership
>After about a 10 minute drive, you're at the town suspected of having mortars
>There's a shitty roadblock set up by the Afghans
>Dammit
>You're about to radio it in when the lead vehicle decides that it's not waiting for you
>When it's half way over the roadblock, an IED goes off
>This tosses the MRAP about a foot in the air, ruining it's wheels
>It seems the Mine Resistant part of MRAP holds true
>Fredrich swivels the MG around to scan for targets while you get on the radio
>"Echo, this is Foxhound, are you alright?"
>Coughing sounds on the radio as your sergeant responds
"This is Echo, fuckers tried to blow up our fucking MRAP. Attempting to move out of your way."
>Echo's vehicle begins spinning it's ruined wheels and is barely able to make it off the roadblock before all the rubber is ripped from the rims
"This is Echo, we might need to bum a ride from you foxhound."
>"We got your back echo. Opening the rear now."
>Fredrich racks the bolt back on the M2 and covers Echo as they retreat to your MRAP
>When Echo team enters the rear of your MRAP, Wilson closes the door and they click on their seat belts
>"How you doing sarge?"
"Not too shabby, considering I just took a blast from a fucking mine. How're you anon?"
>You're about to reply when Fredrich starts firing at something at something in the town
>An MRAP in front of you takes a hit from an RPG and is disabled
>The crew bails as it catches fire and heads for a ditch
"CONTACTS MEIN FREUND!"
>Oh fuck this
>You click the gear shifter into drive and turn to the left
"Anon! What the hell are you doing?"
>"IMPROVISING!"
>You slam the gas pedal to the floor and go off road
>You see an RPG round skim off the hood of your MRAP with a loud 'BONG'
>"HOLY FUCK! FRED, YOU NEED TO KEEP THOSE GOAT FUCKERS PINNED! YOU SIX!"
>You point to the 6 men in the back
>"USE YOUR FUCKING FIRING PORTS AND LIGHT THEM THE FUCK UP! I DON'T WANNA END UP IN A CLOSED CASKET!"
>They follow your orders and you keep accelerating
>The ground is very uneven and you hear bullets pinging off the right side of your MRAP
>You get on the radio
>"CHARLIE! GET YOUR ASS OUT OF THE ROAD AND FOLLOW ME! I SWEAR TO GOD IF YOU DIE I'LL KILL YOU!"
"We got you anon!"
>You turn just in time to see a goat wielding an RPG stare you down through his irons
>OH SHIT
>You veer hard right, just as the goat fires
>The rocket misses you by inches
>You straighten the wheel up and the crew on the left side do a drive by of the poor goat
>You see an entrance into the town and slam on your brakes
>The ABS buzzes to life and the crew who weren't fastened in slam into the back of your seat
>You put the power down and frantically turn the wheel to the right to make the turn
>The rear loses grip and you begin to drift
>In the immortal words of Hamlet
>O fuck (Exit Hamlet)
>You let the wheel spin to the left and correct for the spin
>You straighten the MRAP out and gun it for a tall building
>You realize you just drifted
>In a fucking MRAP
>When you reach the building, you pull the air brake button and the MRAP skids to a halt
>The crew throw the door open and you grab your M240 and a can of ammo
>When you open the MRAP door on your side, it gets lit up with AK fire
>Deciding to be not retarded, you load your M240 inside the MRAP and click the box into place on the side
>You rest the weapon on the top of the MRAP door and use it as a makeshift shield
>3 anthros cross the street and 2 men open fire on you
>You send a burst of 7.62 real fuckin NATO their way and they crumple to the ground
>You pick your M240 off the door and use the carry handle to hip fire the weapon
>You hear pops from the other side of the MRAP as half your squad opens fire
>You see an RPG team peek out from an alleyway and spray in their direction
>The rounds don't hit there mark, but spook the RPG team enough to donk their shot
>You get into a kneeling position and use the bipod as a makeshift foregrip
>When they poke back out again, you fire a burst, killing the RPG wielding goat almost immediately
>His buddy goes to pick up the RPG, but you light him up too
>Your squad is busy handling more hadjis that you can't see while Fredrich is laughing like a maniac on his MG
"GET SOME YOU SHTUPID GOOT FAHKERS! AHAHAHAHA!"
>Holy shit Fred is fucking insane
>You get on your radio
>"CHARLIE THIS IS FOXHOUND! GET YOUR STUPID ASS OVER HERE SO WE CAN DESTROY THIS MORTAR AND LEAVE!"
>You finish the transmission and hear a turbo spool behind you
>You're shitting me
>The left front wheel on the MRAP is shot to shit and they're barreling down the road
>Towards you
>OH FUCK
>You toss your weapon under the MRAP and hit the dirt
>Charlie's MRAP streaks above you and the M2 on top opens up on the poor dumb sand niggers
>The rear doors are open and Charlie's passengers are waiting for the MRAP to halt
>The air brakes are pulled and Charlie jumps out the back, opening fire with SAWs and M16s
>The remaining forces on that street are destroyed within a minute of Charlie joining in
>After the intense firefight subsides, you grab your M240 and regroup with your squad
>"Alright guys, I'll take my fireteam and search this area here."
>You point to the center of the town on your map and point to another open area as well
>"Echo will search this area and Charlie will search the rooftops. Any questions?"
>A tiger marine pipes up
"Who left you in charge?"
>"I did. Because all my life, when I want to get something done, it gets done. Sarge has seen potential in me and I don't see him proposing a different plan. You know why? Because this is the best plan that we can think of right now. So shut the fuck up and get back in line marine."
>He growls a bit but ultimately falls in line
>"Alright, Foxhound, Echo, Charlie, move out!"
>Charlie and Echo Sprinted off towards their objectives while your fire team follows you to the center of the town
>You look over your shoulder
>"Austin, see if you can get on the roof. You could try an-"
>FOOMP
>"Never mind, I think we got 'em."
>Your team makes their way towards the direction of mortar fire
>When you get to the center of the town, you see it
>7 mortars and 12 hadjis guarding the mortar crews
>You get on your radio and turn the volume down
>You whisper
>"Echo, Charlie, this is Foxhound, we have located the enemy in the center of the town. How copy?"
"This is Echo, solid copy. Oscar Mike."
"This is Charlie, we copy. On our way."
>You spot a ladder up to a roof on one of the adobe houses
>"Foxhound, on me. We're going to that roof."
>They follow you as you scale the ladder with your M240 on your back
>You unfold the bipod and load a belt into your weapon
>Fred goes to your side and gets ready to feed the weapon
>You get on the radio and whisper again
>"This is Foxhound to all fire teams, get on the huts and wait for my signal."
>They both click their mics on and off to signal they copy
>About a minute later, the fire teams reached the roofs and gave you the all clear
>Show time
>You rack the bolt back on your M240
>"OPEN FIRE!"
>Your squad opens fire from different angles and the mortar teams are wiped out in seconds
>The hadjis look around to see where the fire is coming from and start firing wildly
>Your squad makes quick work of them
>After you give a cease fire order, you get on the radio
>"All fire teams report back to the MRAPs for egress back to base. Foxhound is going to neutralize the mortars and go back last
"Roger foxhound, over and out."
>You wrap the remaining belt around the M240 and walk over to the ladder
>You slide down and so does your fire team
>When you get down, you turn and speak
>"Anybody got explosives?"
>Wilson raises his hand
>Paw?
>Fuck it, it's a hand now
"I have some 40 mil grenades that I could use to blow the mortar rounds."
>"Good, Austin, get back on the roof and provide overwatch. Fred, go up there and keep Austin covered. Wilson and I will stay down here and prep the mortars for demolition. Let's do this!"
>You and Wilson jog over to the mortars and set up the rounds around them
>You collect the mortars and throw them in a pile as Wilson finished up putting the rounds in the same pile
>He gives you a thumbs up and you run back to the hadji hut
>He runs back too
>"TAKE COVER! FIRE IN THE HOLE!"
>Your fire team takes cover and Wilson fires a 40 mike mike at the mortar pile
>He dives to cover just as the mortar pile explodes
>Dirt and debris fly in the air and you get your squad up and ready to go
>All that's left of the mortar pile is some scattered scrap metal
>After about a minute jog, you reach the MRAP with Echo inside
"Forgot to lock the door anon!"
>Fuck I did
>"You just ruined the bait car sarge!"
>He chuckles as you climb in with the rest of your team
>You start the MRAP and back out, heading back to the airfield

Chapter 4: R&R
>Your MRAP is sputtering and wheezing as the engine struggled to pull the multi-ton beast
>A piece of shrapnel made it through the radiator cover and punched a hole straight through
>The gasket blew about half a mile from the airport and the engine is barely functioning
>When you reach the checkpoint, you click the gear selector into neutral and hold down the gas to keep the engine running
>The guards at the gate let you through as you're forced to shift into drive at max RPM
>The MRAP lurches forward, on the verge of stalling
>When you got inside the maintenance garage, the engine sputtered and died
>Echo team was giving each other high fives and hugs
>Your team was asleep or about to fall asleep
>God dammit
>You shake Fredrich awake and whistle at the foxes
"Vat? I vas hafing ze most amazing dream komerade."
>"Get up and go to the barracks. You can sleep there until sunrise."
"Ja, got it."
>"You two. Get up!"
>They both wake with a start and fumble with their rifles
"We back already?"
>"Get your weapons sorted and head to the barracks. If I see one more failure to fire I'm going to take those rifles and you won't get them back for a week. Got that?"
"Yes corporal."
>"Good, now go clean your rifles! I don't want to see a single black spec on any of them!"
>They rush out the back of the MRAP and you're left alone
>Might as well pop the hood and check it out
>You open your door and unlatch the MRAP's hood latches
>When you open it up, you almost drop it
>A 50 caliber hole was in the side of the crank case and shrapnel had completely shredded the cooling fan
>It's a miracle it made it back to base
>You let the hood slam closed and hop down off the MRAP
>Sarge is standing there waiting
>"Hey sarge, what's up?"
"You did a damn fine job leading these men Anon. You may think that you're not fit to lead, but I can see that you're a natural. Stop by the Lieutenant's office when you can. He says he needs to talk to you within 4 days."
>"Got it sarge."
>You decide that meeting the Lieutenant can wait, and that you're tired as well from lugging an M240 all day
>When you reach the barracks, you hear yelling from inside
>You pick up the pace and fling the door open
>Your fire team is being harassed by a bunch of air force faggots
"You stupid fucking animals wouldn't know the difference between a bolt carrier and a barrel if it hit you on the head!"
"Yeah! Strip your weapon you furry bastard!"
>Austin is in tears, desperately fumbling with his M25 in an attempt to strip the weapon
>One of the chair force asshats kicks the rifle away just as Austin gets the trigger group out
>They point an laugh like school yard bullies...

>10 years earlier: Playground
>You're so excited that papa decided to let you bring your stuffed deer to school!
>Bambi always loves making new friends
>As soon as the recess bell rang, you made a beeline for the playground
>Your friend was going to be so impressed
>At least, he would have if Seth wasn't there
>He was waiting outside the door for you and blocked your path
>Seth stood over a head higher than you and he had that same grin he always did
"Whatcha got there nerd?"
>"I got my deer friend Bambi to play with me!"
"HAHA! Are you 5 or something? Gimme that!"
>He snatches your stuffed deer from your hands and dangles it out of reach
>"HEY! Give it back!"
"Anon's a baaaaby!"
>"NO I'M NOT! GIVE MY BAMBI BACK!"
"Not until you beg."
>"Please give me back Bambi!"
"Fine, here ya go!"
>He tosses your deer on the roof of the school and starts to laugh
>You feel tears begin to form as you try to hide your face
"Aw, is baby gunna cry?"
>"N-NO! I JUST GOT SOMETHING IN MY EYE!"
>You run to the playground crying and find a teacher to get your deer
"Anon! What happened?"
>You didn't want to tell the teacher
>Every time you did, seth beat you up and papa yelled at you for being a sissy
>"I-I threw my toy too hard and it landed on the r-roof."
"Are you sure anon? If something's wrong I-"
>"I'm fine!"
>The teacher cocks her head and then gets Bambi
>You take bambi and run back inside
>You don't want to play anymore

>Present day: Afghanistan
>Your anger and frustration boils over as these fuckwads hit your biggest nerve
>"HEY!"
>They reel around and you see they're barely airmen
>Their eyes widen when you stomp towards them
>"Who the fuck do you think you are? Some playground chad who thinks he can pick on people smaller than him?"
>You're less than an inch from his face when you speak
>"DO YOU THINK HE IS INFERIOR TO YOU DESK BOY? DO YOU THINK MY MEN ARE INFERIOR BECAUSE THEY ARE SHORTER AND FLUFFY? DOES IT MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD TO BULLY FELLOW SERVICEMEN? WHAT SIDE ARE YOU ON AIRMAN?"
"H-hey I don't have to take thi-"
>You grab his neck and stop him mid stride
>"My men shouldn't have to take this either."
>You squeeze his neck and he begins sputtering and choking
>"Now I'll ask you again."
>You squeeze harder
>"What side are you on airman?"
>Venom drips from your voice as your barely contained rage threatens to break free
"GHK YOURS AHGK CORPORAL!"
>You scream into his ear
>"THEN STOP PICKING ON MY MARINES AIRMAN!"
>You toss him towards the door
>He stumbles and falls on his ass
>"Go back to your desk and do some paperwork you fucking POG."
>He tries to stammer something out, but you put your finger up to stop him
>"Say one more thing and I think my sidearm will have an unfortunate misfire into your skull."
>You reach for your weapon
>Before you can bring it out, they're already scurrying out the door
>Fucking chairforce
>You close the door and lock the holster for your 1911
>When you turn around, you see Austin in a fetal position, sobbing
>You walk up to him and put a hand on his shoulder
>"Austin, what'd they do before I got in here?"
>He lets his legs down and reveals that his tail is tucked and his ears are flat against his head
"Th-they w-were walking by wh-when I d-dropped my rifle! Th-they came over and started l-laughing at m-me while I tried to p-pick it up. Fred w-was in the sh-shower when I was c-cleaning my rifle!"
>The door to the barracks flies open and the Lt. walks in
"WHAT IS THIS MICKEY MOUSE SHIT? I SEE AN AIRMAN WITH A BRUISED NECK WALK INTO MY OFFICE YELLING ABOU-"
>You stand to your full height and the Lieutenant stops mid sentence
>You walk over and grab him by the collar of his uniform
"WHAT THE FLYING FUCK ARE YOU DOING CORPORAL ANON? DO YOU WANT TO GET A SECTION 8? DO YOU WANT TO GO TO PRISON FOR INSUBORDINATION?"
>You kick the door to the security office down and throw the Lt. into a chair
"WHO THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU ARE CORP-"
>"SHUT THE HELL UP AND WATCH THIS SIR!"
>You slam your fist on the pay button and the recording plays of the airmen harassing Austin
>The Lt. isn't angry anymore, but intrigued
>The video shows you flinging the door open and standing there for a moment before contorting your face in pure rage
>It shows you screaming at the airman, choking him, and throwing him to the door
>"I will not allow my men to be picked on by some fucking POG in an office chair. I don't care about the rank, the branch, or the consequences, I will not allow anything to happen to these men under my command. If you have a problem with me defending my own, then you'll have to court marshal me."
>You hold your arms outstretched and wait for the cuffs
>But they never came
>Instead the Lt. sighs and rubs his nose
>"Look, I didn't have the full picture before I came and yelled at you. I'm sorry corporal. Also, about the thing I wanted to ask you."
>You put your arms down
>"I'm impressed by your work in the field today. I'm giving you command of your sergeant's squad and promoting you to staff sergeant."
>Your eyes go wide
>2 promotions in 1 day?
>You're on a roll
>He hands you a small box with your new chevrons
>You take them and give him a salute
>He salutes back
>"You're dismissed corp- staff sergeant."
>You turn around and walk out
>When you get back to your barracks, fredrich is asleep and the foxes are assembling there rifles
>When they get them assembled, they bring them to you for inspection
>After inspecting their weapons, you allow them to sleep
>You break out the sewing kit and start sewing your chevrons to your shirt

>Chapter 5: Special delivery
>It's been about 2 weeks since the airman incident
>You were promoted to Gunnery Sergeant and given command of Sarge's squad
>He was now your subordinate and gave you a mock salute every time you entered the barracks
>You hated people saluting you
>You worked for a living
>The Lt. said that your squad was getting a delivery via C-5 galaxy
>Wonder what it is
>3 hours later
>The C-5 was coming in for landing and you waited by the usual stopping point
>The Galaxy blasted past you, screeching it's tires the whole way
>Oh fuck it's heavy
>You run down the runway and see the galaxy stop just before the runway ends
>When you reach the Galaxy, it starts to reverse to a taxiway
>God dammit
>You run back to the hangar where shit usually gets unloaded
>The smart thing to do would have been to wait there all along
>When you reach the Galaxy again, it's nose is already opening and it's ramps extending
>You walk over, panting and out of breath
>When you look inside, your jaw drops
>A fucking M1A2 TUSK Abrams
>Wait, make that 2
>When they backed out of the plane, the Galaxy's tires were visibly less stressed
>You looked back to the galaxy to see your squad cheering
>Not at the tanks, but the crew
>What the fuck?
>They were anthros
>Wait, WHAT THE FUCK?
>FEMALE ANTHROS?
>ON YOUR BATTLEFIELD?
>You autistic screech internally until one of them sees you glaring at them
>She's a snow leopard anthro with a tankers helm and uniform
>She walks up to you and glares back at you
>She's a head shorter than you
>Holy shit she's trying to be intimidating
>It's so cute
"You got a problem with us stranger?"
>Oh my god she sounds adorable
>You look at her and she's a corporal
>"N-no I don't miss. I was just wondering who fucked up and put a female in a combat role. We're fighting to protect you not to fight with you."
>She gets visibly angry at this and throws a punch at your head
>You catch her arm mid swing and she tries hitting you with her free arm
>You catch it as well
>She attempts to struggle away and you keep her arms secure
>She's surprisingly strong for her size, but not nearly as strong as you
>"This is why men take up combat rolls sweetie. Females just aren't as muscular as me-"
>You feel a sharp pain in your groin and look down
>She just kicked you in the balls
>You look back at her and to your balls again, mouth agape
>Your groin guard being the only thing saving your family jewels
>"D-did you just kick my balls?"
"Yeah! You're not letting me go you meathead! Let me go!"
>You let her arms go and she slaps you
>With her claws out
>"OW FUCK!"
>She puts her hand over her mouth
"OhmygoshI'msosorryIdidn'tmeantocutyouIwasjustso-"
>You chuckle and begin to laugh
>"You know what, I take it back. You can stay miss-"
>She looks at you surprised
"Adison. Julie Adison. A-are you sure you're not mad at me? I mean, I hit you pretty hard and-"
>You put a finger over her lips
>"Shhhh. It's fine. I was just worried you might be an easy capture. The locals here are a bit... hostile to anthros."
>You feel the blood dripping off your face
>Fuck that shit stings
>You gotta be tough for the lady
>She grabs your arm and drags you
"Let me take you to the med center mister-"
>Your turn to introduce yourself
>"Anon."
"That's it? Anon?"
>"Yep."
>She rolls her eyes and keeps dragging you to the building with a big red cross on it
>When you reach the building, the nurse gasps at you and grabs some quikclot gauze
>She rips the package open and tapes the gauze to your face
>Shit burns like a motherfucker
>You wince and the nurse speaks
"Sorry anon!"
>"It's fine Nancy. I've felt worse."
>Kidney stones are no joke man
>After about 10 seconds, she replaces the quikclot bandage with a regular one
>The bleeding has already stopped and she tapes the gauze pad to your face
>Hope this shit doesn't scar
>You feel your arm go numb and see Julie attached to your arm
>"My arm isn't getting any blood flow."
"Oops! Sorry."
>The snow leopard attached to your arm now releases you and her ears go flat
>Holy fuck that's cute
>You clear your throat and take her by the hand
>"You part of Foxhound squad?"
>You renamed the squad from bravo to Foxhound to piss off that faggot airman
"Yeah, how'd you know?"
>"I'm the squad leader. Let me take you to the barracks."
>Her ears go even flatter as she buries her face in her fluffy hand
>"Hey, it's fine. I'm not gonna write you up or anything."
>Her ears pop back up and she takes her hand away
>You get up and it's your turn to drag her along
>When you get to your squads barracks, they all wave at you
>When they see who you're dragging along they perk up
>"I know what you're thinking, and no. You're not getting any tonight. She's a part of the squad now."
>They all let out a collective grumble
>"I don't wanna hear it. Keep your hands off her or she has my permission to kick your asses."
>You point to your now slightly bloody gauze pad
>They understand immediately and go back to doing what they were doing
>She mouths a thanks and you let her go
>"Now if you'll follow me miss Adison, I'll show you the luxurious barracks we call home."
>You give her a tour of the small half cylinder barracks you shared with your squad
>They said you could sleep in the NCO barracks, but that didn't seem fair
>Her bed was your old bed
>The one right in the front by the window
>You were going to sleep next to her so the grunts wouldn't get handsy
>The rest of her crew would sleep to your left, blocked off by fredrich
>He was the only one you trusted to keep the marines at bay
>He was also the only one who didn't care when Julie entered
>When you got the last of your stuff from the foot locker by your old bed you realize she's been staring at you
>"Hmm?"
>She looks away, flattening her ears again
"Sorry, you're just being so nice to me after I hit you and I'm just surprised you aren't mad."
>"Why would I be mad? I instigated and got what I deserved."
>Her ears flick back up
"Yeah, you kinda did."
>You get the rest of her stuff into your old footlocker and let her set the combination for the lock
>By the time her crew had settled in and got all their stuff inside, it was night
>You got out of bed and turned the lights off
>"Lights out. We might be going on a mission tomorrow."
>They groaned and you walked back to your bed
>You discover a furry mass had invaded your bed
>Oh fuck this isn't your bed anymore
>"Shit! Sorry!"
>She just murrs and pulls the covers over her a bit more
>Cuteness overload
>You suppress a squeal and slide into your new bed
>It's stiff as fuck, but you're a big guy
>It'll fix itself in a few days time
>As you're about to drift to sleep, you feel your bed move
>A furry arm carefully drapes over you and the bed squeaks
>A cute 'fuck' is whispered and the mass moves a bit
>You feel the covers get lifted and a big lump of fur is pressed against you
>You whisper
>"No funny stuff Missy."
>She squeaks a bit and removes her arm from you
>"You can stay if you want, just no funny business."
>She puts her arms around you again and purrs
>You drift to sleep wrapped in a rumbling furry blanket

>Chapter 6: Desert shield 2 electric boogaloo
>You wake up to the warmth at your back leaving you
>You groan when you look at the time
>4 AM are you shitting me?
>Then you hear it
>A warning over the PA
"All combat personnel! Get to a defensive perimeter on the fence! This is not a drill, I repeat this is not a drill!"
>Oh fuckles
>You hastily put on your vest, boots, and helmet, picking up your M240 and an M16A4 on the way out
>Julie probably doesn't have anything larger than an MP5 or god forbid, a grease gun
>Fuck grease guns man, they sucked in korea and they suck now
>You do your best to run towards your checkpoint loaded down with almost 100 pounds of gear
>You meet up with the rest of your squad at the checkpoint and see Julie and her crew sitting there with fucking grease guns
>God fucking dammit
>You were glad you didn't become a treadhead
>You were shaken from your thoughts as tracers began slamming into the sandbags in front of you
>You throw the M16 to Julie and she takes it with a toothy grin
>You also toss her a few mags
>After setting your M240 on the empty tripod, Fred runs over to you with 5 belts of ammo
>You load one of the belts and rack the bolt back
>It's pitch black out
>The moon has already set and the sun is 2 and a half hours from rising
>NVGs were a no go
>You got on your radio
>"Wilson! Load some parachute flares and spread them around the western flank! I need to see what I'm shooting!"
>About 10 seconds later a loud FWOOMP and hissing erupt from your 3 o clock
>The flare lights the battlefield and reveals 10 afghans running to find cover from the flare
>Before they could, you got a bead on their range, and adjusted your sight
>700 yards
>"AUSTIN! 700 YARDS FRONT! LIGHT EM UP!"
"Aye sergeant!"
>3 shots erupted from your left and you opened fire with short controlled bursts
>They began firing back and you saw the muzzle flash
>A fucking DShK muzzle flash
>"DISHKA! 400 YARDS 10 O CLOCK! FUCK EM UP!"
>The rest of your squad started firing on the DShK
>Sparks flew from the DShK's gun shield as 5.56 millimeter angry bees impacted the plate steel
>The gun fell silent as you continued taking shots at the further goat fuckers
>The barrel on your M240 was starting to glow red hot as you continued to put more rounds on the durkas
>You didn't have time to change the barrel right now
>Your Marksman was reloading and the rest of your squad didn't have the range
>Or did they
>You thought back to the indirect fire used by russians in WWI and II to face rape hill sides with volleys of nugget fire
>Maybe 5.56 would have enough energy at 700 yards to kill
>"SQUAD! PREPARE FOR INDIRECT FIRE! 700 YARDS! WINDAGE 0 AUTOMATIC FIRE!"
>Your squad immediately opened fire and you saw tracers drop on top of of hadjis as the flare started to flicker out
>"WILSON! ANOTHER STARLIGHT FLARE!"
>Another FWOOMP and hiss later, the hadjis were lit up again, except there were less of them
>Your squad managed to indirect volley fire a swarm of angry bees at a bunch of hadjis
>You look over and Julie is still spraying the M16 at the afghans as the last of them retreat to the town
>She manages to nail the last one before they got in to town
>She's swapping in another mag
>An empty mag
>She fired all 300 shots you gave her?
>You tap her on the shoulder and before the flare dissipates, you see her eyes are almost entirely covered by her pupils
>She's scared
>God dammit command why do they send women to fight?
>Equality is good and all until you put emotionally weak females into a combat scenario
>Then everything unravels and people get killed
>You take the weapon away from her and she stares at you with her dilated pupils
>The lights kick back on at the airfield and she's crying now
>Fuck what do you do?
>You've never even had a girl friend before because you're borderline retarded when it comes to socializing
>Fuck it
>You pull her into a hug and pet her, expecting to get another slap in return
>She melts into your hug and starts sobbing into your shoulder
>The rest of your squad, being normal, non autistic people, back off to their barracks as soon as the all clear is given
>You sit there holding her and trying to calm her down with soft pets
>She pulls away from you, still sobbing
>You take her back to the barracks and she goes straight into your bed
>She sits with her face against the pillow, still sobbing
>You don't dare ask what's wrong, for fear of being verbally murdered
>She finally calms down enough and speaks
"I-I could have died out there. I c-could've gotten m-my crew k-killed. H-how do you d-do it? *sniff*"
>You actually don't know
>You've been wondering why you don't break down and have a panic attack every time you almost die
>Every time your squad is in danger
>It baffles you how you're able to hold together so well
>"I-I don't know Julie, it's a mystery to me. I just don't know."
>She doesn't look satisfied with your answer, checking your face for any signs of lies
>She breaks her gaze and just looks to the door
>She has it
>The 1000 yard stare
>Everybody who doesn't have the right emotional state to deal with taking somebody else's life has it
>A few of your squad mates have it
>You felt terrible
>She was too young and innocent to live with that kind of burden
>Having to live with killing somebody else
>Having to deal with taking somebody's father away
>It consumes people who aren't equipped to handle it
>You put a hand on her shoulder and she just melts into you
>When you lay down, she backs herself into you, purring softly
>She's so soft and warm
>She's also pretty hot
>NO BAD PENIS! GO AWAY
>Your dick threatens to become fully erect until she turns around and pulls you into an embrace
>You return it, not caring about your dick anymore
>fullmast.jpg
>Her purring gets slightly louder when your dick touches against her
>She doesn't seem to mind, and just falls asleep
>You decide to do the same before your dick takes direct control
>You fall asleep and dream of being surrounded in warm fur

>Chapter 7: Tip of the spear
>You wake to a soft purring
>After giving the cat in front of you a quick scratch under her chin, you get out of bed and get dressed
>You finally had armor to take and hold the town with
>Word was Afghan troops had T-72s and even T-90s
>We had some javelins in the MRAPs but the clay huts these durkas squat in provided no protection from their 125mm guns
>Force recon even spotted a few T-90MS's heading towards the town
>How these goat humpers got a hold of some of the most advanced russian tanks, nobody knows
>But they had them and they were a threat
>Being an engineer, you knew that the tandem charge missiles were going to be a huge problem even for the TUSKs
>So you devised a plan to keep the crew of the tanks safe
>You look over and see it's already 4 in the afternoon
>You get your sidearm and get Julie out of bed
"mmm five more minutes."
>"We don't have five minutes, and they have T-90MS's with tandem charge missiles! I gotta get your tanks fitted with some cage armor stat!"
>She perks up at the mention of a T-90
"Russians?"
>"No, but the durkas have them, so I need to make sure you don't get killed. Now get your shit and meet me by the tanks."
>She bolts out of bed and starts pulling on her tanker uniform
>You rush out the door and scan around for any fencing or something that might defeat the tandem charge before it can hit the main ERA
>You find some old Stryker cage armor and decide that might work
>After about an hour of dragging old cage armor back to the tanks, you're finally ready to fit it on the tanks
>The engineers brought the welding equipment and began to get to work
>After about 2 hours of work the tanks were equipped with an extra layer of cage armor
>The cage armor only covered the crew compartment, meaning a hit to the engine would still knock it out
>But this was going to have to do, as the Lt. got on the radio
"This is kingpin to all squads! We have sightings of multiple Alpha Victors heading towards the town. Requesting all units mobilize on the town how copy?"
>"This is Foxhound actual, solid copy."
>The rest of the squads radioed in and finally the whole platoon was ready to go
>The sun was already setting by now, and you needed to move fast to get into town and set up defensive positions
>The rest of the platoon already secured the town and were able to hold it
>Until armor started showing up
>It wasn't too bad at first, a stray BTR-60 here and there
>Then the BMPs started arriving
>They fired 9M14 Malyutka's at the MRAPs and Humvees before they could even get a TOW round off
>Eventually, the BMPs began using ERA armor to keep the TOWs at bay
>After the M2s started blasting them with 50 caliber freedom T-62s and T-64s started entering the fray
>They had ERA as well, meaning only javelins and Armor piercing were effective
>But now that the T-90s were spotted, they needed armored support to deal with them
>You were that armored support
>Your squad mounted up on the M1s as they began their startup procedures
>About 10 minutes later, your squad was barreling towards the town at almost 50 MPH
>Your M240 was kept trained beyond the village as your LAWs rattled on your back
>The Lt. was adamant about you taking some form of anti-tank protection
>Same with the rest of your squad
>Good thing these LAWs weighed next to nothing on your back
>Even Julie had a few inside the tank to pass around when we ran out
>After about 10 minutes, you reached the other side of the town and saw the dust coming from beyond the hills
>"THEY'RE COMING! GET YOUR ASSES IN AMBUSH POSITIONS!"
>Your squad hopped off and took positions on the roof
>The tanks backed into alleys and the humvees retreated backwards
>It's time
>Fred was cackling like a madman as he leveled his LAW with the hilltop
>"Austin! Range on those hills?"
"About 200 yards sir!"
>Perfect
>"WHEN THOSE TANKS CREST THAT HILL, WAIT UNTIL I GIVE THE SIGNAL TO FIRE!"
>You get on your radio
>"Foxhound, to Greyhound, as soon as you hear us volley off our laws, you be ready to engage the tanks. We should take a good chunk of their ERA off so you can land a decent shot on their front turret."
"Read you loud and clear Foxhound, Greyhound out."
>After you click your radio off, the first tanks crest the hill
>"Get your LAWs ready!"
>You popped the cover off both ends of the LAW and extended it
>The second and third tank crest the hill behind them
>You decide to wait, considering they wouldn't attack with only 3 tanks
>"THEY'RE PROBING US! HOLD YOUR FIRE!"
>After the 3 tanks had gone about 40 yards, they stopped and the commanders hatch opened
>You got on radio
>"Get your asses down. Don't let them spot you or this won't work."
>Your squad got down just in time to avoid the Afghan commander and the sound of more rumbling came from the hill
>10 more tanks crest the hill and you get up, crouching
>"OPEN FIRE!"
>BOOF!
>about 20 more boofs went off and the first 3 tanks were completely fucked
>The remaining tanks on the hill were struck with the LAWs and it blew their ERA blocks
>You heard the whine of the abram's jet engine from behind as you readied another LAW
>"FIRE AT WILL!"
>BOOF!
>You fired again at the hill, striking a T-90MS in it's lower plate
>"GET OFF THE ROOFS!"
>Your squad jumped off the roofs just before shots whizzed over them
>The abrams turned towards the T-90s and fired it's main gun
>The russian tank erupted into flames and the turret exploded
>The abrams slewed it's turret back to another T-90MS
>The T-90 had fired a missile and it was barreling towards the turret
>Big fucking mistake
>The turret is the strongest part of the Abrams
>The missile impacted, exploding 3 times
>First, impacting the cage armor, then the ERA, and finally, the Depleted uranium composite mix
>It did absolutely nothing to the abrams
>The abrams, however, fired a depleted uranium sabot straight into the lower glaces of the T-90
>The tank's turret blew off the chassis, landing with a large CLANG on the ground
>You decide that it's time to take a position on the Abrams' turret with your M240
>After confuckulating with the tracks, you get a foothold and climb onto the rear
>You set your M240 up and loaded a belt of black tips
>You slapped the cover closed and racked the bolt back
>You were going to destroy the ERA from a distance
>You open fire, leading your rounds onto the ERA blocks of T-90s
>The blocks exploded under the torrent of lead you threw at them and the abrams fired at the opening
>The tank's hatches opened and the fire spews out, as the crew try to escape
>Not on your watch
>You light them up and they drop one by one
>This continues for another hour or so before the tanks and Afghans are finally destroyed
>This was gonna make a helluva story later on

>3 hours later
>The town was successfully defended and you bummed a ride home with Julie
>You laid on the turret of the tank, being tired from the constant running and shooting
>Not to mention the stress
>You pulled out your shitty iPod with a broken screen and put on something to listen to
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cLoytewvn0g
>You smiled and laid back as the tank rocked and jerked over every bump
>You didn't mind
>After sitting through the whole song, you were finally back at base with the rest of your squad hopping off the rear of the tank
>You help Julie out of the tank, much to her annoyance
"I don't need help anon! I can get out just fine."
>She then fell back into her seat, conking her helmet on the hatch
>You chuckle and offer to help her again, which she accepts
>Once you pulled her out of the tank, you went to the mess hall
>They were serving pizza today because the pizzeria offered the marines a deal on pizzas
>Fuck yeah pizza
>You walked with Julie to the mess hall and entered
>A projector was set up and a giant white projector mat was set in front of it
>The movie was 2001 a Space Odyssey
>You actually never watched it before
>You sat down and Julie sat right next to you
>As the movie started, you grabbed some pizza and began to eat

>About an hour into the movie, Julie had fallen asleep on your shoulder, purring
>You smile and pet her head
>The purring gets louder and her tail wraps around your leg

>The movie ends and everybody gets up to return to their barracks
>You carry Julie to your barracks and find your squad is already asleep
>You lay Julie down on her bed and put a blanket over her
>Her tail is flicking around, throwing the blanket off every time you put it on
>You finally give up and decide to just put her in your bed so you can sleep
>Her tail wraps around you and her purrs get even louder
>You try hard not to pet the tail
>You gotta pet the tail
>After petting the tail for half an hour, you fall asleep from exhaustion

(New writing style from now on.)

You wake in your cot, the hot desert air threatening to strangle you to death. Your ass feels like a swamp and your mouth feels like sand paper. You slowly sit up, stretching once upright.

Looking around you, the barracks is empty. No gear was left on the bunks and no blankets were messed up. Julie was also nowhere to be seen. This sent you into a panic, scanning the room one more time in hopes of finding her.

Nothing but a light breeze. You get yourself out of bed and grab a box of tissues, taking a few to wipe your forehead clear of sweat. After doing this, you toss the tissue mass into a trash can and grab your gear. The soft breeze now being accompanied by the whine of engines. Turbine engines to be exact.

When you have donned your BDU, plate carrier, ammunition sack, and M240, you exit the barracks. The door slammed closed behind you as you look for the source of the engine noise. You find your source and sling your MG over your shoulder before jogging to the Abrams. Julie spots you and waves towards you.

"Hey Anon! We're moving out in 5! Get up here or get in an MRAP!"

You nod and stop beside the tank, clambering up the tracks and on to the engine deck. Once on the deck, you climb on the turret and go prone, unslinging the heavy hunk of steel from your shoulder. You place the machine gun on the turret and grab a box of ammo from your sack. You open the cover on the gun and pull out the belt, sliding it into the feed tray. After slapping the cover closed, you rack the bolt back and push it forward, readying the weapon.

The tank's turbine spools up more and you grab on to the commanders hatch opening for support. The Abrams lurches forward and you look behind you, the other tank following suit.

"You ready to take a city Anon?" Julie yelled over the high pitched whine of the engine.

"Ready as I'll ever be!" You responded at a similar volume.

The MRAPs were following the tanks as they rocketed along the stretch of dirt road.
