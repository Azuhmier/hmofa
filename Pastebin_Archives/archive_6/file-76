DAY WITH A WOLFESS

>Be camping out solo, deep innawoods.
>There's been rumors that some tribal Anthros live around here, but fuck it.
>The trip had been pretty tiring, as you had hiked all day to get to your campsite.
>After getting your campsite all set up, you strip down to your underwear and climb in your sleeping bag.
>It doesn't take too long for you to fall asleep.

>That night, you wake up in your tent all sweaty.
>You quickly realize an Anthro wolfess is sitting on top of your sleeping bag, pinning you to the ground as she leans over you, her thick fur tickling your nose as she sniffs at you.
>You start trying to shake her off of you, and she quickly realizes that you're awake.
>She barks out something some language you don't understand, and she grabs your arms and puts her full weight onto your legs.
>She leans in close to your face and whispers something in your ear in a quieter tone of voice.
>Oh boy, a damn tribal.
>She resumes sniffing at your face, deeply inhaling your scent as if trying to memorize it.
>You try to tell her to get off of you, but she just cocks her head at you upon hearing your unfamiliar language.
>She sits up a bit and looks you directly in the face, a wide smile on her face.
>She excitedly barks something at you, and tries to open your sleeping bag.
>Lucky(?) for you, she doesn't seem to be able to grasp the concept of zippers.
>She unhappily huffs, before trying to brute force the bag open, trying to pull it apart like a bag of chips.
>The zipper on your cheap sleeping bag pops open, and she smiles widely again.
>She then tries to slip herself into the bag with you and you realize just how large she is.
>She has to be at least 6'6", and she has the muscles distinctive of a tribal Anthro.
>Oh fuck.
>You try to scramble out of the bag, but she quickly wraps her arms around you and slips a digitigrade leg over yours, holding you tight enough that you can't escape, but not enough to be uncomfortable
>She pulls you close, your face pressing into her neck; her tribal scent filling your nose.
>She's so fluffy and warm that you don't think you'll be needing to zip up the bag.
>Shifting around in her grasp, you try to mumble out some more words of protest.
>She huffs at you and places a hand on the back of your head, pushing your face back into her neck.
>Her other hand strokes your back, and you suddenly think you should have worn more than underwear to sleep.
>She whispers more of her language into your ear, her tone becoming more sensual.
>When you don't respond, she pulls your head back a bit, and begins to gently lick your face. 
>You look at her in surprise, as you thought Anthros only licked each others faces if they were mates.
>Wait a minute.
>Oh shit.
>She grins widely at you, before pulling you back into her neck.
>You pull one of your arms out of her grasp, in one last attempt to escape her floof.
>She quickly grabs your arm and puts it around her, and then lets out a mix of a whine and growl at you when you move it, seemingly wanting you to keep it there.
>Not wanting to anger her, you oblige, your arm resting across her back.
>After snuggling like this for a few minutes, she seems to already be sleeping.
>You try to fight off sleep, but eventually her soft embrace takes its toll on you and you drift off as well.
>When you wake up, you're alone.
>You remember the events of late last night, and wonder if it was just a dream.
>Then you realize your sleeping bag is open, and you have several black hairs stuck to you.
>You also realize that there's a huge hole in the tent where the entrance should be.
>You get up, and peek out of the gaping hole.
>The wolfess is nowhere to be seen.
>You quickly throw on some clothes.
>Thinking she's gone, you step out of the tent and quickly survey your campsite.

>Looking over your tent, you conclude that she must really have no clue how zippers work, as to get into your tent she had simply ripped a huge hole in it.
>The zipper on your sleeping bag is also busted.
>It was made of metal and not plastic, so she must be pretty strong.
>Luckily, all your other belongings seem untouched.
>Maybe having a nice breakfast will cheer you up.
>You sit near the small campfire you had made the day before, and start to get a fire going.
>After you get the fire started, you put on a bit of water to boil to make coffee, and begin to open an MRE.
>Nice.mp3
>You sigh as you open the small plastic packet.
>Why the hell did you bring the spaghetti?
>You don't even like that one.
>Sighing as you stir your dehydrated coffee into the water, you hear a stick crack behind you.
>Oh boy, you already know what's about to happen.
>Putting your coffee down, you get up and look behind you.
>Surprise surprise, it's the wolfess again.
>In the daylight, and with you both standing up, you manage to get a better look at her.
>She has a dark gray coat, and you can see her tail fanning side to side behind her.
>She's about as tall as you thought she was, at around 6'6".
>She's wearing a simple tribal outfit, just a homemade leather belt with a small loincloth pinned to it around her nethers, a wrap of what looks like deerskin across her chest, and a couple small pouches hanging from her belt, along with a small stone knife as well.
>She smiles at you, and holds up what she was carrying.
>It's two salmon, already gutted.
>You look at the two salmon she is holding, and your stomach begins to grumble.
>It looks like she was fishing in the river near your campsite. Did she just bring you breakfast?
>As your thoughts process this development, she looks at the fire you started and then quickly back to you.
>Her grin gets even wider as she stares at your face.
>It seems she's satisfied at your knowledge of how to make fires.
>She says something to you in her tribal language, and sits near you, setting the fish she caught on the small grate you had over the fire.
>She looks at the small steaming cup of coffee near you and cocks her head, sniffing at the steam.
>Before you can stop her, she picks up the cup and inhales the scent of it deeply, before taking a small sip.
>Her face scrunches and she spits it out, before emptying the contents of the cup on the ground.
>Well, there goes your morning beverage.
>She shakes her head at the cup, before setting it back down beside her.
>She smiles at you and scoots closer to you, putting a fluffy gray arm around your shoulder.
>With how poofy her arm feels, it looks like she must already be getting her winter coat.
>She whispers something into your ear, before licking the side of your head.
>She then rests her head on the top of yours, and sits there.
>You think that maybe you should say something to her, but you decide to keep your mouth shut as she wouldn't understand you anyways.
>She sits there with her head resting on yours, and you both watch the salmon cook over the fire.

>After awhile, she sits up and motions towards the two salmon.
>You hand her the metal tray you use to eat MREs on, and she takes it.
>She examines it with a confused look, before shrugging.
>She scoops up the fish with her claws, and deposits them on the plate.
>She thrusts the tray into your hands with a wide smile on her face.
>You guess she must have already eaten before you woke up.
>That or she was just really eager to feed you.
>You set the tray down, and grab your pack to get something to drink.
>You pull out the tastiest product in the world, a nice refreshing can of Dr. Pepperâ„¢, and crack it open.
>Boy oh boy, you can never have enough of the smooth cool taste of Dr. Pepperâ„¢!
>You sit back next to the wolfess, and she watches you eat with a proud smile on her face.
>The salmon is pretty good, even though it's unseasoned and you have to pause every couple bites to spit out pin-bones.
>It looks like she's happy that you're happy.
>When you finish eating and set down the tray, she suddenly stands up and pulls you to your feet along with her.
>She then pulls you into a strong hug, and begins to gently lick at your forehead.
>Then you remember that this is usually only a gesture between couples in Anthro cultures.
>Was she trying to come onto you or something?
>You decide that it doesn't really matter at the moment and simply enjoy the hug.
>You return the hug and begin to stroke at her back to try and show your appreciation for the meal, forgetting about the gaping hole she tore in your tent.
>She lets out a small appreciative growl, and nuzzles the top of your head.
>Then she's sniffing you again, pushing her muzzle into your short hair and inhaling deeply.
>She seems to like what she smells even though you haven't bathed since you entered the woods a couple days ago.
>Then she lets go of you and grabs one of your forearms, tugging it a bit, saying something to you in her language.
>At first you're a bit confused, but then you realize that she's trying to get you to follow her.
>You're worried about leaving your campsite behind, but you don't think trying to stay is an argument you would win, so you relent.
>You start walking slowly with her as she pretty much drags you through the woods, away from your tent and campfire.
>Upon seeing your growing apprehension, she huffs, and all of a sudden lifts you up and drapes you over her shoulder.
>You let out a surprised yelp, and she pats your leg and says something to you in a sweet tone of voice to try and comfort you.
>Then she moves faster through the woods before you stop at a large, slow moving river about a mile away from your campsite.
>She sets you down on the pebbled side of the river, before she takes her belt off, along with her loincloth and chest wrap.
>Embarrassed at her sudden nudity, you avert your eyes from her and cross your arms.
>You hear her say something to you from behind you down near the river, and then she marches back across the pebbled shore over to you.
>She repeats what she said to you, and you motion to her exposed body and shake your head.
>She cocks her head and you and lifts a furry eyebrow, confused at your sudden change in mood.
>She takes your hand and leads you down near the shore.
>She wades in the water up to her waist, before she looks over to you and happily says something to you, motioning for you to come in.
>You look down at yourself, and contemplate whether or not to join her.
>You were only wearing a t-shirt, a thin jacket, and an old pair of jeans, along with your pack..
>It was kind of warm for fall, but you didn't want to take a chance and get sick in the middle of the woods with nobody but some Anthro you barely knew around.
>She seems to sense you not wanting to follow her, and she huffs before trudging back onto the shore to be with you.
>She smiles at you and begins to pull at your clothing.
>Well, it looks like you're going to be getting wet whether you like it or not.
>This time you undo your jackets zipper, as she had a bad track record when it came to opening them so far.
>She smiles at seeing you take off the jacket, and leaves you to finish taking off the rest of your clothes.
>You decide to leave your boxers on, and set your clothes in a small pile next to her loincloth and chest wrap.
>You wade in the river next to her, and she smiles at you as you stand next to her.
>Why did you get in the river holy shit its cold as fuck why did you think this was a good idea.
>You quickly trudge back towards the shore, and she follows you closely.
>When you get near the end of the water though, she whines and puts her arms around you, stopping you in your tracks.
>You gasp upon feeling her chest press against your back.
>Her breasts weren't very large, but it was certainly big enough to be noticeable.
>Her nipples pressed into your shoulders like tiny daggers, hard as rock.
>She pulled you down with her so you were both sitting on the shore.
>She then started rubbing your upper back with her clawed hands.
>Oh, she was trying to wash you!
>You hold up your index finger towards her, making her cock her head in confusion at you.
>You stand up, walking back to where your pack is sitting, opening it and reaching around inside.
>You grab a small box of soap flakes and walk back over to her.
>You sit down and lather up some of the soap in your hands before beginning to work it onto your body.
>She sniffs suspiciously at the soap, before seemingly deciding that it was alright to have around her.
>When you're done getting yourself covered in suds, you motion for her to turn around so you can return the favor.
>She cocks her head at you, before she suddenly smiles, understanding your intentions.
>She hunches over next to you, and you begin to work the soap into her thick coat of gray fur.
>She huffs appreciatively, and leans back into your touch.
>After a while she suddenly gets up and turns around, wanting you to wash her front.
>Uh oh.
>She puffs out her chest to you, and when she sees you hesitate, she gently grasps your hands and puts them on her chest above her breasts.
>You sigh, and work in the soap the same as you did for her back.
>You wash almost the entirety of her front, avoiding her breasts as much as possible.
>When you move away, thinking she'll wash them herself, she tells you something in her language you can't understand.
>When you just stare at her, wondering what she said, she takes your palm and places it on her breast, her smile a mile wide.
>You nervously begin to rub at her breasts, her nipples poking your hand just like the small riverstones you were both sitting on.
>She begins to pant and her eyes narrow as you work the soap into her fur.
>When you finish getting her all soaped up she smiles at you before grabbing your shoulders and dunking you both underwater to rinse the soap off.
>You gasp when you pop back above the water.
>This damn river is colder than Jack Frost's nutsack!
>You both make your way out of the river and back onto the shore, and she shakes herself dry, sending water flying everywhere.
>You chuckle at the situation in front of you, while you try to dry yourself off with your jacket, using it as a towel.
>You throw your clothes back on and jam the jacket into your pack.
>After she gets dressed, the wolfess walks over to you and takes your hand, her larger fingers interlocking with yours.
>The two of you walk back to camp, although this time you aren't being carried over her shoulder.

>When you get back to the campsite, you drape your jacket over a branch to dry, and sit by the smoldering campfire.
>The fire must have died while you were gone.
>It looks to be around noon now, so lucky for you, it had warmed up enough so you didn't need the fire for heat.
>The wolfess smiles at you once more, before it falters a bit and she whines.
>She scooches next to you and hugs you tightly, burying her muzzle into your hair.
>Then she gets up, and looks at you with a sad look.
>Wait, is she leaving?
>Jer hands fiddle with her belt, and she opens a small sack hanging on it.
>She gives you a small smile, and drops a couple small items into your hand, before closing it and hugging you again.
>She then gives you another sad face, and turns her head to look into the deeper part of the forest, where you figure she must have come from.
>She licks your face a few more times, before she turns and walks into the woods, slightly hunched over.
>Looks like she wanted to stay longer, but she must have to return to her village.
>You look at the things she gave you and smile.
>She had given you a rock with a small streak of copper in it, and a small, -but brightly colored- songbird feather.
>At first you're pretty confused as to why she gave you them, but then you realize they must be keepsakes of hers.
>As the sound of her walking off grows farther away until you can't hear it, you wonder if you'll see her again soon, as you had planned to stay the whole week at the campsite.
>You smile as you put the treasured items in your pocket, and sit back down and begin to stoke the dying embers of the fire.
