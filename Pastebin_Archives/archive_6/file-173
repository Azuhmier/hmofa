>Be Wolfess anthro.
>Late December, right near Christmas.
>Be invited to date at coffee shop.
>Think it's a joke.

>Sure enough, it's a cofefe parlour.
>"Coffee Pawz" reads a wooden sign hanging over the entry.
>There are stylised pictures of anthros on the sign as well as stylised pictures on the door in very bright, welcoming colours.
>You feel giddy and scared and... Excited?
>Your phones vibrates and you pull it out and check the screen.
>It's your boyfriend.
>*I can see you. Come on in. I've got a table.*
>Your head whips around scanning the inside of the shop.
>You spot him, casually sitting at a wooden table made of a rich dark wood.
>Fuck.
>Back where you come from, coffee was a ceremonial drink, used as an aphrodisiac and to consummate marriage.
>This must be a front or a joke, right?
>Surely he was pulling you along and would come out any second, right?
>lolno.
>He waves you in.
>You go.
>You open the door and are immediately struck by the rich scent of roasting and roasted coffee, the sweet touch of sugar and the warm glow of hazelnut.
>There are several tables dotted around, a coffee-bar and four lounging areas with overstuffed armchairs and low tables.
>The scent is enough to rile you up.
>You remember drinking coffee for the first time.
>You felt like you were in heat but ten times worse.
>Just smelling this place and the memory of that day... It was enough for you to make you bite your lip.
>You're welcomed by wolf anthro, almost the same as you but, while your fur was jet-black, hers was a russet-red colour with a hint of white.
>She takes a sip from a mug at her table.
>"Hello miss. Welcome to Coffee Pawz."
>You nearly faint at the sight.
>Glancing into her mug you can see the inky-black, rich, dark coffee.
>You struggle to make noise after seeing what she just did.
>Eventually, you do. "I-I'm here to see m-my boyfriend."


>She smiles at your struggle.
>"Not a problem miss. His name and species?"
>You reply, still not fully thinking straight. "He's a human."
>She nods and takes another sip of the steaming brew. I only have one today. Reservation for two?"
>You nod yes.
>"Follow me please. I'll get you set up right away."
>You walk closely behind her, intoxicated by her.
>How could she be drinking coffee so casually?
>So freely?
>She must be feeling some of the effects.
>How many cups has she had today?
>How often does she drink it?
>She must be wet all the time.
>Feeling that tingle and the warmth all over.
>Before you know it, you're at the table.
>"Hey gorgeous." You boyfriend beams at you.
>"Hey. When you said 'let's go for coffee' I didn't think that you meant... Y'know... Coffee."
>Let me clarify something.
>You and this guy have been friends for a long time and just started dating.
>Why not, right?
>You know each other well enough... Or so you thought...
>"What else could I mean?" He asks. "Anyway, I heard that this place is really anthro friendly because of the Right and Left thing, I thought that a little extra research could avoid some racist idiot."
>"That's very thoughtful. Thank you." You reply to his sweetness.
>You're sitting down now, coat off and going over the menu.
>They have thirty different kinds of coffee, at least.
>Not only that, they have pastries, danishes, cakes, bunts, cookies and every other manner of things to go with coffee.
>This place was like a sex shop combined with a porn studio and a strip-club all in one.
>For you at least.
>Your guy is just browsing the menu, humming and hawing, chatting lightly with you while he makes remarks about this heat-inducing beverage.


>Eventually, a waitress comes by.
>"Hi there! Welcome to Coffee Pawz. What can I get you today?" The bubbly black jackal asks while flipping open a notebook.
>You boyfriend looks at you, expecting you to go first.
>What a mentalgan.
>You, on the other hand, have your heart hammering in your chest and the spaghetti is practically on the ceiling at this point.
>"N-N-No... It's- *Ahem* It's fine... Y-You order first."
>He's concerned. "Hey, is everything alright? You seem... off..."
>"Hehehe... No. I'm fine. Just... Just go ahead and order."
>"Well. Alright."
>The waitress turns and looks expectantly at him.
>"What's a strong coffee with lots of flavor?"
>She smiles a wolfish grin. "Well, sir, we have lots of coffees here and we can even combine blends, if you like. I prefer the Cuban. It's really strong and has a boldness to it like no other."
>She's drank that?
>You imagine how strong that would be for you.
>You've only had one scoop of light roast the only time that you had it.
>Your thighs rub together as you imagine the heat the Cuban coffee would mimic.
>He looks impressed. "That good, eh?"
>"Oh yes sir. I drink it every day."
>PAHHHHHH!!!
>Whatdidyousaynigger.webm
>You cannot believe what you just heard.
>This little jackal must be wet all the time with that coffee.
>You imagine the heat that she's feeling right now.
>You imagine how wet she must be.
>How much her pussy must be tingling with the need to be filled.
>You realize how wet you currently are.
>Suddenly, you realize a different scent.
>Hidden under the coffee and sugar and pastry, there's something else... Something... Primal.
>It's the scent of a pack of bitches in heat.
>Something else. Your boyfriend is the only male here.
>Almost all the other patrons, the ten or so that there are, are canines and are all female.
>You look over and see the hostess, the one that greeted you, chatting with a barista while they are both sipping mugs of steaming sex.

>You can do nothing but gush your wetness as you imagine what must be happening to their bodies.
>The heat from the coffee warming their bellies as the heat from their vaginas driving them mad.
>You imagine what they're like in bed.
>With them being in constant heat, they must fuck like it too.
>Pounding, thrusting, bed-shaking FUCKING.
>”Miss?” The jackal asks you with a small smile. “Are you ready to order?”
>Your heart drops and rests nicely beside the stone in your stomach.
>You pray to your autism that you don’t make a total ass out of yourself.
>”U-Um… What’s a… A coffee without t-too strong… That isn’t very strong?”
>The waitress is all too happy to assist.
>Coming around to the back of your chair, she presses her breasts into the back of your head and begins pointing out things on the menu.
>You’re only half-listening.
>She REEKS of heat.
>Of sopping-wet pussy and the want of a big, long dick to stuff herself with.
>It’s intoxicating to you as you begin to feel your heart race and your pulse in your neck.
>You don’t even know if you NEED a coffee at this point.
>Never the less you decide to order.
>You say, before you can catch yourself, “I’ll have a Cuban, too.”
>Niggerwhat.gif
>”Great!” The jackal said coming around to the side of the table again. “Any pastries or nibbles that I can get for you? Everything is made in-house.”
>”They make everything here?” You ask in a small voice.
>The jackal is growing very concerned. “Are you alright darling? You seem kind of flushed. Why don’t I get you a water, alright?”
>You nod meekly, not quite looking her in the eye.
>Not with how horny she is still fresh in your mind.

>You boyfriend asks. “Is it racist if I ask if canines can have chocolate? Sorry but I know that regular dogs can’t and I wasn’t sure.”
>The waitress smiles. “That’s not a problem at all sir. It’s wonderful to see someone who is so caring about anthros, especially in this day and age. It’s not a problem at all for canines like us to eat chocolate. There are some individuals that are allergic to it and we have a substitute for them. Were you thinking of getting something with chocolate on or in it?”
>Your boy orders for you both. “A slice of chocolate coffee cake and a couple of pastries, please.”
>She’s scribbling on the pad. “Any preference on the kind?”
>”Surprise me.” He says with a confidence that makes your heart jump and your walls pulse.
>”No problem, sir. I’ll get you both some water and then your coffees in a sec.”
>She spins and walks over to the coffee-bar.
>Now, the part that you were dreading.
>Talking to the guy you were on a date with, without exploding the spaghetti like an Italian terrorist.

>Thankfully, you can’t really get into any serious conversation as the water gets there.
>You pick up the water and down it almost in one gulp before handing it back to the jackal and saying “More please!”
>She is mildly confused. “Umm... Yes miss… Your coffees should be ready in a moment.”
>After she walks away, your boyfriend begins suggesting things to do.
>“We could go to a movie or maybe laser tag or out for dinner after some window-shopping? I dunno. What do you want to do?”
>You reply with the most autistic thing that you can think of. “We could spend the day and night at my place.”
>What even in the fuck?
>Are you high?
>For honest and serious, what the fuck?
>Maybe all the roasting coffee is having an effect on you.
>You’re certainly wet enough.
>Maybe you’re not high but how are you this horney?
>You haven’t even had any coffee yet.
>You begin to dread what will happen once you take that first sip and descend into mindless heat.
>Your guy, thankfully, is not the brightest crayon in the box. “Oh. So, like a movie? I can cook for you but you’d need to show me where everything is.”
>Thankfully, the spaghetti is not quite at critical mass yet.
>Sadly, the only repreve you will get is when the covfefe gets to the table.
>That also means that you’ll have to drink it.
>Maybe even eat some of the treats.
>Why are you getting excited?
>This is a nightmare.
>You’re trapped in a date at a sex parlour that anything you touch will send you into immediate and uncontrollable lust for anything with (or without) a dick.
>Your pussy gushed juice onto your thighs.
>Your legs quivered.
>Oh shit… 
>The coffee is set in front of you.

>The scent is staggering.
>Ritch and full-bodied roasted beans.
>It’s inky and black and smells delicious.
>You see the human across from you smile at the waitress and smile as he sips from the black coffee.
>Then he looks at you.
>”Aren’t you going to try any? It’s quite good.”
>The Jackal is standing over your table with a grin.
>”It is quite good miss.” She grins even wider. “Try a pastry with a sip. That always gets me going in the morning.”

>”M-Morning?” You ask.
>That damn jackal’s smile grows wider. “Yes miss. Every morning, I have a nice big cup. I’m useless without it.”
>The human across from you pipes up. “Oh, yeah. I know that feeling. I love coffee. Ever try an espresso?”
>”Once. I tried it but I couldn’t finish it. I was a puddle on the floor before the cup was done.”
>It was that strong?
>”Anyway” He says, partially rescuing you. “I’m sure you’re busy so I won’t keep you.”
>”Not at all sir. If there’s anything else that you need just wave me over and I’ll be right there.”
>She spun and walked over to another table.
>The scent of her heat crashed into your nose like a tsunami.
>Your nose seems to be much more sensitive.
>He picks up his mug and gestures to yours.
>You wrap your hands around the mug, feeling the warmth and dreading it.
>The smell of the roast assails your schnoz and you can feel your body wanting to be bred.
>You shutter as you bring the coffee close to you.
>He holds out his mug across the table and smiles.
>You want that smile.
>You want to sit on that smile.
>Lock your legs behind that head and make him drink you.
>Snap out of it girl.
>You clink your mug with his and force a smile.
>He smiles even wider. “Smells good, doesn’t it?”
>You nod.
>Spaghetti almost reaching critical mass. “S-Sure it does. Mmmmmm. Coffee…”
>He takes a sip and smiles.
>”Oh that’s fucking good. Try it.”
>Moment of truth here.
>Dont fuck it up.
>Hold your pussy in until you can get home.
>You pull the mug up to your lips.
>Here we go.
>Down the hatch and into the worst heat that you’ll ever have.
>You take a sip.

>You feel the warmth of the drink rolling down you throat as you condemn yourself to the heat.
>The flavor explodes in your mouth.
>You can taste the soil that it was grown in.
>The hot Cuban sun.
>The water that showered it.
>The years and years that it’s taken to get a simple drink to the level that it is.
>The ritch bitterness all over, the sweet touch at the tip of your tounge and the pepper at the back of your throat.
>You shiver at the explosive and exciting taste of the beverage.
>”Mmmm. That’s really good. That’s incredible!” You say, excited and amazed.
>He laughs. “You act like you’ve never had coffee before.”
>”Only the once.”
>”Just one time?”
>You nod.
>”That’s a shame. We need do this again. I can’t have my girl being left out of something as fun as coffee.”
>You laugh.
>A genuine laugh.
>You’re relaxed and you take a nice big gulp of your steamy drink.
>You chat with your boyfriend for a while, draining your first mug.
>And then another.
>You eat some coffee cake and it’s more delicious than anything that you’ve ever tasted.
>You are halfway down your third cup.
>All that's left of the snacks is crumbs.
>He wait patiently for you to finish.
>You do and he waves the jackal over.
>When the bill comes he offers to pay but you tell him. “I’ll bite you in the wrist if you don’t let me pay half.”
>He relents.
>Total comes to $21.50 or $3.00USD
>You get up to leave. 
>Coats on and out the door.
>He jingles his keys in his hands.
>”Hey,” He says, “How about a drive? I’ll bring you to my place or yours and I can make good on that dinner?”
>You smile wolfishly. “Sounds great. I took public anyway. I like to walk.”
>You sigh and smile. “Something about ancestral memory and all that.”

>He walks you over to a 2015 Audi.
>You don’t know what model.
>He opens the door and you slide into a comfy leather seat.
>You sit and a shock of electricity shoots through your spine as your ass hits the seat.
>It has begun.
>You can feel the coals that were gently fanning in your belly growing stronger and more robust.
>He gets in the drivers side.
>The fire explodes like a oil tanker dropped its load on the embers.
>It rolls through your body like an ocean of fire.
>Up from your belly to your chest and out to the tips of your fingers.
>Your legs start to quiver as the boiling warmth shoots into your heels.
>Then, as if it’s alive, the fire pulls back from all parts of your body and slams itself into your pussy.
>You gasp, nearly cuming from the sensation of the mild pressure of your sitting on the leather.
>He starts the car.
You mumble to yourself. “Please, quickly.”
>”Hmm?” He asks.
“Oh, nothing. Let’s get to my place.”
>”Sure.”
>He starts driving.
>Less than five minutes pass but in those five minutes the heat has gone from urgent to unbearable.
>Your cunny keeps squeasing on it’s own and the musk you’re putting out is absurd.
>There’s no doubt that you’ve soaked your panties.
>You’re sure there’s a wet spot on the seat now.
>You arrive at your apartment.
>Yes.
>Now the fun can begin!

>You nearly pull him up the stairs.
>He’s struggling to keep up with you as you drag him into the lobby.
>Over to the elevators you go and you begin jamming the keypad so fast your finger hurts.
>”Hey?” He asks. “What’s going on? You’re acting kind of weird.”
“Nope. Needy yes. Weird no. Where’s the fucking elevator!”
>He nods slowly.
>”You know that you don’t owe me anything, right? I took you out and, if you want it to be, that can be it.”
>You round on him and let out a predatory growl.
“You are going nowhere. We are going up to my apartment if I have to drag you there by what’s left of your lower half if you try and run.”
>He smiles that big goofy grin.
>”Wow. You must really want me to cook for you, huh. I feel like rumors of me have been greatly exaggerated.”
>Before you can reply the elevator dings and opens.
>A cute but huge draft anthro exits the elevator.
>She’s wearing a bright yellow sun-dress and straw hat that match perfectly with her rust-red colored fur.
>Her name is Isabel and she makes fucking good lasagna.
>As she steps out of the slow-ass machine she smiles at you.
>”Oh, hi! It’s been a while since I’ve seen you entertain. Who’s this?”
“It’s my boyfriend.”
>That came out rather harshly.
>You’d feel bad if your world wasn’t consumed with the need for cock.
>She sniffs the air.
>”That smell… Oh… OH! That’s you?”
“Yes Isabel, that’s me…”
>She smiles and looks at your male in tow.
>”Good luck.”
>She flashes a winning grin and saunters out the front door.
>He turns to you.
>”Good luck? What did she mean good luck? Also, yeah, I don’t know if it’s something to do with the building but it’s kind of musty in here.”
“Oh is it?”
>Please don’t suspect…
>”Yeah. I’m not sure why I didn’t notice it before.”
“Well the building is kind of old. That’s why I can afford the rent so cheap.”
>You had gotten into the elevator by now and had hit your floor.
>You’re on the way up to deal with this mind-numbing heat.
>Then again…
>The source of relief is right next to you...
