>Your stomach growls just as you enter the house.  You desperately attempt to shush it, not wanting to make any unnecessary sound.
>...but you're so HUNGRY.
>You swallow a pitiful whimper and shake your head in an attempt to clear your thoughts.  It's time to focus.  All your hard work is about to finally pay off.
>It's hard to keep from drooling as you imagine the wonderful meal awaiting you just a few rooms away...
>With a predatory grin, you lick your lips and move closer to your prey.
>You are a Phantasmagore, a creature more commonly called a Dream Eater.  Or, in particularly uninformed circles, a Baku.
>You've never liked being compared to those fat, ugly tapirs.
>You are a lean, mean, nightmare machine!  A regular apex predator of the mind!  A master of psychological warf-
>OW!
>Ow ow ow.
>Why do humans have such short doorways?
>You bite your forked tongue to keep from whining, and gently rub your head.
>Stupid human world.  Everything's too small.
>You keep walking, this time making sure to crouch down a bit, and eventually reach your destination...
>The human's bedroom.
>As you enter, you immediately notice a tiny souvenir dreamcatcher.  Pfft, how cute!
>You snatch it up and scarf it down effortlessly.  It eases your hunger a little... but mainly makes your appetite flare up even more.
>Snickering to yourself quietly, you creep closer to your mark... then stop when you see something moving in your peripheral vision.

>You snap your head towards the movement... then curse yourself when you realize it's just your reflection.
>Oh well.  At least you have a moment to touch up your fearsome appearance, in case he wakes up.
>You grumble and fix your blackened wool.  It's far too neat to frighten a human; you need to look more wild and unkempt.
>You examine your claws, then gently nibble one to sharpen it a bit.  Your pointed tail waves about idly.
>It's funny.  Humans always say your kind look like wolves and sheep mixed.  You personally don't see it.  After all, you just have a canine snout, horns, and wool; nothing wolffish or sheepish about that!
>Your red eyes glow mischievously, all three of them resting just above a maw full of fangs.  You sharpen them every night!  ...even though you don't actually use them for dream eating.  No, they're for seasoning up dreams into your favorite food...
>Nightmares.
>Even thinking of the word has your mouth watering again.
>You've been stalking this human for weeks now, psyching him out.  You've hidden in the darkness, letting off bonechilling howls and vicious snarls when appropriate.  You've given chase to him in the woods.  You've even given him some terrifying glances at your monstrous form...
>You hope this nightmare is a juicy one.  You've been kinda neglecting yourself in hopes of seasoning this one to perfection.
>Satisfied with your looks, you stalk forwards, taking a deep, tantalizing whiff of your target's nightm-
>Wait.
>WAIT.
>WHERE'S THE FUCKING NIGHTMARE?

>Okay, Somna, don't panic.  Don't p-
>SHIT YOU'RE GONNA STARVE.
>You have doomed yourself, all for a stupid cooking experiment.
>You hang your head in despair, and sniffle quietly...
>...hang on.  What's that smell?
>You sniff the air again, and follow the scent to your prey.
>Cautiously, you lean over his head and take a deep breath, your third eye narrowing.
>He's definitely dreaming, thank goodness, so you'll at least get to eat.
>Problem is... it's not a nightmare.  So all your work was for nothing.  Dammit.
>...what IS he dreaming about?  You can pick up a hint of your own presence in his mind... 
>You gently press your head against his, peeking into his dreams...
>...what the hell?

<Anon>

>Over the last few weeks, you've felt like something's after you.
>At first it was just a feeling.  Then came the snarling and growling from the bushes by your house.  And the footsteps chasing you through the woods.
>But the strangest thing?
>That sound you heard in the woods.
>"BAAAAHWOOOOO!"
>You were so confused, you started looking for the source of the howl...
>And caught a glimpse of a curvy monster woman.
>Being a frequenter of furry sites, it didn't take long for your imagination to turn a stalker into a fantasy.
>Tonight, however, marks the first time you've truly had a lewd dream with her in it.
>Your brain didn't even bother with a plot.  
>You just showed up in a dark clearing with that mysterious woman already waiting, a dangerous grin on her face.
>She's been showing herself more and more lately, so you have a photographic memory of her appearance.
>She's much, MUCH taller than you; 8 feet easily.  Cloven hooves take the place of feet at the end of her long, lean legs.
>A tail reminiscent of Halloween style devils swings behind her, emerging just above a firm, toned ass.
>Above her wide hips is a narrow waist and a stomach you somehow know is empty.
>From there, a sizable chest gives way to her face... a wolflike visage lined with fangs.  Three red eyes glow in the darkness, slit pupils eyeing you hungrily.
>Pointed ears twitch alongside short horns.
>Most bizarre, however, is the fact that she's covered in black wool.
>You're tempted to call her a wolf in sheep's clothing, but feel that may not be entirely true...
>Whatever the case, you shrug and get naked in your dream.

>Once your dream self is in the buff, the woman chuckles sinisterly before unhesitatingly dropping down to her knees.
>With a toothy snarl, she lunges towards you, fangs bared; your heart skips a beat.
>She stops just shy of castrating you with her teeth...
>And snickers before giving you a teasing lick with a forked, black tongue.
>It's enough to have you standing ramrod straight already, much to her apparent delight.
>The woman winks before unceremoniously clamping her jaws down on your length, beginning a masterful assault on you with her tongue.
>Her tail undulates wildly as she allows quiet, indecent  sucking sounds to escape her mouth.
>The warmth and suction on your dick is too much to handle.  You start bucking your hips in her direction, with her matching your pace and rocking back and forth.
>Just as you feel yourself about to finish, she opens her mouth and backs off...
>Only to bring you to a climax with one last lick.  You fire off a load, and she effortlessly catches it and swallows in one fluid movement.
>She gives you a smoldering stare with all three eyes as she slowly rises and turns around.
>She bends forward, presenting her hindquarters, and uses her tail to point out her already-wet slit.
>As if you needed a guide.

>Without further ado, you grab her ass and relentlessly plunge your length into her, eliciting a long, throaty moan.
>She looks back with an expression of pure desire, and you are determined to satisfy her.
>Working up a rhythm, you begin pounding into her tight, white-hot insides, feeling her clamping down on you tighter and tighter.
>She slowly works herself up to panting and moaning rapidly, one hand steadying herself and the other gently tweaking her nipples.
>Her tongue dangles from her mouth as her eyes glaze over with pleasure.
>Sweat begins to run down your face as you pick up the pace.
>She starts to let out a howl of bliss, but bites her lip.  Determined to make her scream, you redouble your efforts, thrusting mercilessly into her depths.
>She is entirely at your mercy now, having lost all sense of composure in favor of pure lust and ecstasy.
>She merely pants and whimpers as you bring her closer and closer to the edge.
>It's only when she begins shuddering in anticipation that you finally end it.
>With a long, drawn out howl, she collapses in a heap, your seed dripping from her satisfied womanhood.
>With a sly grin, you give her rump one last squeeze as your dream comes to an end.

<Somna>

>...he... he's dreaming about having SEX with you?
>Humans are so fuckin' weird.
>Oh well.  It's a dream, and you're starving.  Might as well eat it.
>As you take a taste of his fantasy, you gasp in shock.
>It... it's better than any nightmare you've ever eaten!
>This human's dream of bringing you to ecstasy is the greatest delicacy you've ever had the pleasure of tasting.
>...you ravenously devour the entire thing.
>Normally, you never finish a dream.
>Tonight is different.
>You smile down at the human and sigh happily.
>...if he cooked up such a delectable dream from your stalking...
>What if he woke up next to you?
>You snicker and climb into his bed.
>With a yawn, you rub your now-full stomach, enjoying the feeling of having your hunger fully satisfied for the first time in decades.
>You cuddle up against the human, making sure your face is the first thing he sees tomorrow.
>...you soon fall asleep yourself, letting your feast swirl around in your head.
>...damn, he's actually kinda hot...
