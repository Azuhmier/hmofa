>”How about a dumb dick flick like ‘Metal Agu0r’?”
>You actually wanted to see that one, so you don’t want it spoiled
>”Fine, ‘Night of the Drunken Werewolf’ then?”
>Not really into romcoms…
>Dammit, Anon. This isn’t something we’re going to be actually watching!”
>Right, right
>The German shepherd taps her nail on her phone lazily
>”Here, ‘Super Jackal’. Half a star. Nobody’s going to be there, and it’s starting soon.”
>Sure, why not?
>You and Minny are driving to the budget cinema, where all the already-out-on-video flicks are trying to squeeze out a few more ticket sales
>The crowds are always sparse, and the place gets most of its revenue off overpriced concessions
>Empty seats are what you’re counting on
>The first date you had with your canine girlfriend ended with public lovemaking in an art museum
>It may have ended in tears, but looking back it was a pretty passionate night
>One that Minny suddenly got the urge to try again, now that her life is a little happier
>But, doesn’t her ex-roommate have a bunch of friends who work at the theaters?
>”Shit….”
>Her face then lights up with smugness
>”Actually, that’s perfect. I’d love word to get back to her that my Anon and I have such a close bond now.”
>Guess old grudges die hard
>…Damn, that would have been a good movie to see together

>The cinema definitely looks like it’s budget quality
>The carpets are torn, there are broken bulbs all around the posters, and you’re lucky if you can find a working arcade machine
>You get the tickets, and she gets the snacks
>”Gotta mix the sweet with the salty,” she says with a nudge to your ribs
>You kind of feel bad, considering how much more expensive the food is in comparison
>Then again, she knows you can’t complain about what candy she picks this way
>As you walk toward your theater, Minny runs over and grabs a massive handful of napkins
>”We may need these.”
>Just like you hoped, the room is completely vacant
>You timed it excellently, and the previews are ending just as you sit down in one of the loveseats
>The movie itself is…pretty bad
>You and Minny spend the first half just riffing on the terrible plot and acting, not caring about the volume of your voices
>Now you’re getting anxious to begin your little tryst, but you both agreed to give it some time in case a few last-minute viewers drop in
>Every so often a kernel of popcorn ricochets off your face
>You turn to Minny, who’s nonchalantly watching the screen
>”What?”
>*Bap*
>What?
>*Bap*
>This repeats for some time
>Your cheek is coated in salt and butter
>Minny leans in and licks it off, then moves in for a full kiss
>The two of you share the moment repeatedly, with only a few brief pauses for refreshments
>”Hey, can I have a Sugar Splotch?” she eventually says
>Whoops, all gone
>”What?” she scoffs. “You’re a fucking chowhound! That’s MY favorite candy and you ate a whole box by yourself!”
>She pouts and stands up, hopping over the seats to sit in the row in front of you
>You shoot a kernel at her in revenge
>It sails through her pointed ears like they were goalposts and bounces off her snout
>She turns around and slams the bucket out of your hands, spilling popcorn all over the place
>Guess the fun’s over
>You lean forward and pinch Minny’s ears when she’s facing forward
>She folds them back with a growl
>You start rubbing the base of her ears
>Now you’re scratching them as well as the back of her head gently
>She lets out a content sigh with her tail wagging through the back of the seat, slapping your legs
>Your hands move down to her shoulders, giving them a soothing massage
>”You’re not…getting off that easily,” she hums
>Well, you hope not either
>The massage goes on for a while
>She’s almost catatonic in her relaxation, but the purpose for you two being here floods back to her
>”Alright, loverboy. Let’s do this.”
>Minny turns back around and rests her arms on the seat
>”How should we decide who starts? Maybe about some ‘rock, paper, scissors’?”
>Sure
>”Cool…wait, what’s scissors look like, again?”
>You hold out two fingers
>”Huh? You want to go second after all?”
>She holds up two fingers mockingly
>That fucking girl…
>”You lost. Get over here.”
>You move to her row and forced to the floor
>Uggghhh, it’s sticky
>”Quit your complaining, that’s what the napkins are for.”
>She didn’t want to get quite as cleaned up enough to wear the dress she wore on your first date, but she’s got a pretty short skirt on instead
>Nothing else down there, either
>She grabs the hem and lets you stick your head underneath
>Her legs spread out a bit, giving you full access to her swollen lips
>You grab her waist and go to town
>Her thighs reflexively clasp around your head
>Between the stifling air under her skirt and her own body heat, you’re already starting to sweat
>She pushes down on your head, trying to grab it through the fabric
>”H-ha…An~on…n-nggahhh.”
>There’s only so much noise you can get away with even in an empty theater, and Minny’s trying her hardest to restrain herself
>Oh?
>Looks like there’s a little red dot of candy down there as well
>You glide over it with your tongue, sending a shockwave of pleasure through the German shepherd
>”OoooohhhhOOOHHHH!”
>She quivers at the climax, then slumps over in her seat
>Well, they said, “turn off your phones”, but…
>You pull yours out and bring it under the skirt
>”What, you gonna’ take a picture while you’re down there, you per-AAAHHH!”
>You had kicked on the vibration on your phone, and now you’re pressing it against her slick box
>The sensation almost pushes her over the edge again, but she clamps down with her hands and squeezes you with her thighs again
>”E-enough of that!” she pants. “You’re gonna’ lose your phone if you keep pulling shit like that!”
>That would probably void the warranty, too
>”Alright, get up here.”
>You hop onto the loveseat next to her
>Minny unzips your pants and fishes around for what she wants
>”I hope you won’t make a girl get down on that grimy floor for this,” she chuckles
>You’re about to object to the unfairness, until her muzzle dips down and her tongue laps at your groin
>She coaxes it to full length before you can finish inhaling
>One arm’s around your backside while the other rests on your legs
>She gives it a few more licks before taking the whole thing into her mouth
>You shakily stroke her neck as your other hand intertwines with her paw
>It would be the ideal way to watch a movie, if your eyes weren’t glazing over from the sucking
>You grunt her name as you get close, but she just seals her lips as tightly as possibly
>Your release is quickly swallowed in a few short gulps, and Minny brings you back down by delicately cleaning your shaft
>When she’s done, the German shepherd reaches back to the drink holder and plops down next to you, sipping her soda as though nothing happened
>You can’t even remember how the movie ended
>As the credits roll Minny swings her legs over and sits on your lap, holding on to your neck
>You can already feel your arousal growing a second time
>”So, champ. How do you feel about a ‘double feature’?”
>A poor teenage cat enters the theater to begin cleaning up
>He sniffs the air in confusion
>You’re already thinking of apologies for making such a mess on the floor
>And for the popcorn as well
