>It's a beautiful day today.  The sun's shining, there's a pleasant breeze blowing, and your favorite song is stuck in your head...
>Mainly because your wife is whistling it as she walks, just like always.  You cast a loving look over at her.
>You've been married to Lena Lynx for a little more than a year now, and every day has been like something out of a cartoon.  Mainly because, well, she IS out of a cartoon.
>Despite the breeze blowing head on, her fur barely moves in the wind.  She walks with exaggerated, rhythmic movements that follow the tune she's whistling.
>Her grayscale fur makes her stand out even amongst a town where several non-human women live.
>But, honestly?  You wouldn't change a thing about her.
>Lena stops whistling and smiles, her ears twitching mischievously.  She speaks in her ever-so-slightly grainy, tinny voice.
>"Where we going today, sweetheart?  Thought we had errands to run?"
>With an audible tone, a little black question mark appears above her head as she tilts her head inquisitively.
>"Don't worry about it, Lena; you'll see where we're going soon."
>She giggles and wraps one of her arms around you, hugging you close as you continue walking.
>"Well, wherever we're goin', it couldn't be a nicer day!"
>She shades her eyes and looks up at the sun, winking at it audibly.  You chuckle, remembering that the sun in her old toon winked back.
>She sighs happily, wrapping her tail around you with an accordion sound.
>"I love you, Anon.  Hope you never forget that."
>You crane your neck and kiss her on the cheek, prompting little black hearts to drift up from her head.
>"Love you too, Lena."

>She starts purring loudly as she grasps your hand tightly.  Her white-gloved fingers interlock with yours as you continue to walk.
>She soon begins happily whistling her favorite song, resuming her rhythmic swaying and dancing.  It's not long before you begin mimicking her moves, well, as best you can, anyway.  You're not as flexible as her.
>You can't help but notice people watching her as they pass by.  Some smile and adopt her tune, whistling along.  Others look confused, but politely nod.
>One woman, a white wolf, smiles and gently tips her wide-brimmed hat as her human companion waves.
>Lena takes in the attention with a broad grin, beaming at you.
>"I wonder if any of 'em remember my old show?"
>You shrug, masking a smile.
>"Who can say?  Even if they don't, it doesn't matter; you're here now, in the real world."
>Her smile widens even farther.
>"Yep!  You're stuck with me, Anon!"
>She chuckles again, kissing you on the forehead and putting loudly.
>"I wouldn't dream of being with anyone else, Lena."
>She stares at you with a smile...
>Then lets out a loud OOF when she bumps into something.
>Lena falls back onto her rear, a cloud of grey dust proofing up from the ground and an exaggerated CRASH echoing.
>She rubs her head with a little scowl, then audibly blinks a few times.
>In front of her, also on the ground, sits an older woman who seems to be... a lynx hybrid of some sort.  The woman frowns and rubs her head, tousling her silver hair.
>Lena immediately hops you and dashes over.
>"I'm sorry!  You alright, lady?"
>Your Toon wife helps the red-furred lynx up, with the older woman brushing dirt off her dress.

>The woman smiles appreciatively.
>"I'm fine, thank you, miss..."
>Her eyes widen as she gets a good look at Lena.
>"...y-you're not... Lena Lynx, are you?"
>An exclamation point appears above the Toon's head as she smiles.
>"I sure am!  You... recognize me?"
>The red lynx hugs your wife, smiling.
>"Recognize you?  I loved your cartoon! I watched every episode growing up."
>Tiny, inky tears well up in Lena's eyes.
>"Wow, I-I can't believe someone remembers little ol' me.  You've made this ol' gal's day, miss..."
>"Conne, sweetie.  Rita Conne."
>"Miss Conne.  I can't tell ya how happy this makes me; thank you!"
>The two women laugh and chat about Lena's show for a while before parting ways, waving farewell to each other.  Lena sighs happily, wiping tears of joy from her eyes.
>"Can ya believe it, Anon?  She KNOWS me!"
>"I heard!  I'm happy for you, honey."
>She wraps her tail around you again, squeezing you lovingly as you star walking again.
>"So, we almost there, Anon?"
>"We are.  But you have to close your eyes, okay?  It's a surprise."
>"Ooh!  Gladly!"
>She makes a point of closing her black eyes, then whips a blindfold from nowhere and ties it over them.
>You chuckle at her antics, then lead her to your destination.

>As you enter, you wink at the staff.  They were already expecting you, since you called weeks ago.
>Lena probably thinks you forgot, but today's her birthday.  Well, at least, according to her show, it is.
>And you've had a surprise planned for a while now.
>As you walk, Lena quietly hums her theme song, swaying to the beat as always.
>A few, older members of the staff smile nostalgically at her inkblot appearance.  Some younger ones seem confused, but still grin at you.
>A nervous looking cat sheepishly squeaks out a hello, then runs off on her way.  Lena chuckles.
>"Sounds like someone was a bit of a fraidy cat, huh?  Where are we, anyway?"
>"Patience, honey.  We're almost there."
>You lead her in through the double doors, and stop just shy of the theatre's massive screen.
>The room darkens, and you lay a hand on Lena's shoulder.
>"We're here."
>Before she can take off her blindfold, the first few notes of a familiar song fill the room.  Lena gasps and rips off the cloth as the screen shows a warm, friendly face...
>Her face.
>She looks around the theatre with an awestruck expression, seeing countless people waving and cheering as her theme song begins to play.

>The first episode of Lena's cartoon begins as you lead her to a VIP seat.
>Your wife stammers.
>"H-h-how... did-did you do this?"
>"Don't worry about it.  Just enjoy the show.  They've got every episode up there, and we're gonna marathon them all."
>Black tears of happiness streak down her face as she smiles lovingly.  Hearts appear in her eyes and above her head as she practically tackles you into a hug.
>"Happy birthday, honey.  I love you."
>She purrs so loudly you can barely hear anything else.  Above the happy din, you can faintly hear her babbling "I love you" rapidly.
>The audience around you fawns over your wife, cheering and AWWWWing at her affections.
>When she eventually lets you go, she keeps an arm around you and turns to the screen.
>"Every single episode, huh?  Well, let me give you the backstage commentary for each and every one of em, sweetheart."
>And so she does.  Every last episode prompts her to launch into a story of what it was like to "film" that short.
>The people around you listen intently, laughing and smiling at her tales.
>Lena devours the attention, tail whipping happily and more tears glimmering in her eyes.
>She plants a kiss on you after every story, with the crowd AWWWing appropriately.  One young woman behind you attempts to catch some of the hearts constantly drifting from your wife's head.
>For three hours, your birthday surprise continues in this way.  Episode after episode is met with applause and cheers.
>By the midpoint, everyone in the room is singing along to her theme song every time it starts.
>Lena practically melts every time the chorus of her name rings out.

>Eventually, it all comes down to this.
>The final episode.
>Even the theatre staff are singing Lena's theme song now.  She can barely carry a tune through happy sobs, but you happily let every word fly.
>She leans on you, wrapping her arms around you tightly.
>This is the only episode she offers no commentary on.  She merely sits silently, running a hand up and down your side and kissing you countless times.
>The crowd laughs raucously at the toon, driving her to beam happily each time.
>You rest your head on the massive, fluffy tuft of fur around her neck, listening to her purr.
>"T-thank you so much, Anon.  I love you.  I love you so, so much.  You're the best husband ever."
>"And you're the best wife, Lena.  Happy birthday, honey.  I love you."
>As the Lena onscreen takes her final bow, the crowd goes absolutely wild, practically shaking the theatre with their applause.
>Lena pulls you into a loving kiss just as the toon fades to black.
