>You rap your knuckles against the plastic pipes; a muffled gurgling resonates from within
>You are, well, you, and you're currently dealing with a slime infection
>"Oh dear," your elderly client responds, "can ya fix it? The thing's been clogging my sink all day."
>Procuring a drill and testing it, you assure the lady that you're a professional
>A revolving bit digs into the PVC while a scream gains in clarity within the pipe
>The drill penetrates, and you pull out, a thin line of slime...fluids hanging from it
>You steadily grab hold of your weapon as more and more green gunk begins to leak from the cavity
>An unblinking eye cartoonishly squeezes itself out of the tiny hole, staring at you with malice
>Wait for it...
>The second eye escapes, glaring with equal scorn
>And...
>A third, pink organ starts to exit, somewhat struggling to make it out
>There it is
>As if on cue, the translucent ball flies out at alarming speeds towards you, only to be greeted with a good swing from a two-by-four
>The slime's core splatters against the bathroom tiles, and a bloodcurdling yell can be heard
>Meanwhile, the goo that pooled out begins to disintegrate, making your cleanup job easier
>A quick sealing of the pipe and a brief exchange of funds later, you walk out two hundred dollars richer
>This is your life as an exorcist
>As it turns out, there is no true religion
>Gods, demons, even folklore monsters manifest into reality through faith
>While vanquishers, vampire hunters, and ghostbusters alike were glorified in past centuries, your kind is more akin to handymen these days, going around and fixing hauntings, removing attic goblins, and the works
>Your last job of the day finished, you stroll down the city streets in twilight
>On your path, you brush against several interspecies(?) couples: man and animal spirits and chunky girls with orcs
>A jolly man is giving a piggyback ride to a small fox familiar, her bubbly giggles receiving the attention of several soft-hearted onlookers
>You briefly wonder where these people would be if their supernatural partners were never real, but you dismiss that notion
>Although you do wish that you had companionship
>Even if you're living a decent life, you haven't been having much luck with the other sex
>You'd be having anxiety too if a large stranger with a rough mug approached you
>As you curse your father for his scowling genes, a sharp whistle pierces through the crowd's bustle
>You turn towards the source- an alleyway, and an old man stands hunched over, peering at you with sealed eyes
>While you were sure that the whistle would've made the entire street vigil, no one seemed to pay it any mind aside from you
>You walk over to the elder, and his baggy features lighten up
>"So you can see me. Good, good."
>The senior takes out a handkerchief and blows into his large, beak-like nose, and you take note of his entirely silk outfit 
>Silk suit, pants, and sandals, decorated with gold trinkets all over, most notably the falcon pin on his breast pocket 
>"I would like to ask for a favor from you, youngster," he mutters as he pockets the fabric
>Well, it's not uncommon for demons to hold grudges against other otherworldly beings
>Fire away, you guess
>"Eager to the call of action. You would've made a good man among my army when I was still hot and kicking," he guffaws, and you get a glimpse into his eyes
>Pure gold sclera and a black pupil, like a bird of prey
>"Here, as proof of what's more to be offered," he reaches into his pockets and procures five coins before shoving them into your hands
>A surprisingly strong grip aside, you note that these coins are without doubt gold if their weight says anything
>You swallow hard
>Whatever this wrinkly gentleman wants, it must be important
>"My little kitty ran across the street, and I'm afraid this old body isn't as lithe as it used to be. I would appreciate it if you would just keep her out of harm, alright?"
>You nod, but before you could pry more info out of him, the old man's gone in the blink of an eye, leaving you in an empty alleyway
>Yup, you're definitely dealing with gods here
>Turning around, you face the alleyway across the street
>You're pretty sure you're gonna regret whatever you're gonna do
>Anxiety and a dry mouth accompanies you as you make your way over
>Treading across the pavement, you feel as if someone hat turned on the heat, the air lacking moisture as gusts blow across your face, impeding only you and no one else in the crowds
>You feel insane, and what you're being paid to do will most likely be insane as well, but you've agreed, and breaking agreements can't be solved with rainchecks when dealing with dieties
>The coins forced in your pockets feel heavier, as if something's trying to prevent you from making it to your destination
>Too late
>While you stand in front of the alleyway, you scan for any signs of an animal
>No mysterious marks, no random clumps of fur, nothing
>Looks like you'll have to venture in
>You take a step into the hall, and your vision blurs
>What you see flickers in front of you, sand flashing in and out of cement, the cityscape in front of you vanishing into a desert before reappearing
>You step forward with your trail leg, and the shifts in the scenery blend together, like you're looking at two see-through layers stacked on top each other
>Looking behind you reveals a translucent image of the daily passerbys paying no attention to you, yet you can also see a vibrant dusk in the midst of a desert, fiery reds stretching into the vast violet sky
>Back in front of you, a lone feral lioness fixes its gaze at you in the desert realm
>It seems to have been expecting you
>You trudge forward, the dry landscape losing its opacity as the alleyway disappears
>What used to be two walls to your sides are now the same view as the one in front of you- endless sands meshing into the horizon
>"Hmph," a gruff grunt escapes the lioness's throat, and you cock an eyebrow in surprise
>"Son of man, chosen warrior of Ra," the feline rises on its legs, noble as a predator, "you dare intrude upon my domain and expect my compliance? I shall show no mercy to this insolence."
>Before you could retort, a blinding flash encompasses your vision
>The air becomes unbearably hot, and you start to feel lightheaded
>When you regain sight, a lion-headed giantess, standing 20 feet tall, looms before you
>Like the old man, she is also clad in silken clothing with golden trinkets, albeit more loose-fitting and primitive
>Showing off her powerful limbs and stomach, her attire resembles characters in ancient Egyptian lore
>"I AM SEKHMET," the figure booms with a threatening echo, "I WILL RIP YOU LIMB BY LIMB AND DRINK YOUR ESSENCE AS MEAD FIT FOR A GOD!"
>Sekhmet waves her hand
>A pillar of flames erupt to her side, and a bow of ridiculous portions materialize out of it, embers flickering in and out like the tongue of a salamander
>You were suddenly reminded of the time you suffered a burn while trying to remove the beastly lizard from a chimney, which doesn't help
>"TO SHOW HONOR," Sekhmet states, "I WILL NOT LEAVE YOU UNPREPARED."
>A snap of her claws, and your work shirt is replaced with similar gear, armed with a curved sword, a scimitar, on your side
>Complaints about the lack of privacy of your new outfit is soon replaced with the now cool desert air lowering your body heat
>"NOW," the goddess draws her bow, and an arrow of flame appears as the string is drawn, "RUN. MY ARROWS WILL RAIN DOWN LIKE PLAGUES THAT BLOTS OUT YOUR HOPES OF SURVIVAL."
>You are very intimated by this
>Every muscle in your body wants you to get the hell out of here
>You can still leave this realm, out of the alley, and binge movies at home
>However, the small, logical voice in the back of your mind speaks to you
>Goddess or not, she is still a demon
>She is trying to trick you into leaving
>Remember that time you got duped by that pixie and threw away a thousand bucks for nothing?
>Fuck her
>Fuck this guy, too
>Yeah, fuck her
>"HM?"
>Shit, you said that out loud
>Newfound confidence surging through you, you draw your sword and instead charge towards Sekhmet
>"FOOL. DO YOU THINK I WOULD NOT ANTICIPATE THIS?"
>Before your weapon could swipe at her long legs, Sekhmet raises her foot and stomps down, trapping you underneath
>The sand cushions you to a degree, but you could feel yourself being crushed
>"MEN. SELFISH CREATURES WHO DO NOT HEED SOUND ADVICE. I PITY YOU."
>Despite the circumstances, you find yourself thinking, thinking about how you can turn this around, just like how you deal with everyday critters
>Your grip tightens on your scimitar, waiting for an opportunity
>"I SEE YOU HOLD THE WILL TO LIVE," Sekhmet continues, "RA IS LESS OF AN ADDLE-MINDED TURKEY THAN I THOUGHT. VERY WELL. I WILL BESTOW A SECOND CHANCE UPON YOU. YOU WILL RUN, AND NEVER COME BACK TO THIS DOMAIN."
>You feel the weight on your back loosening
>An opening!
>Instead of turning and fleeing like Sekhmet expected, you flip yourself around and stab in the center of her digitigrade feet
>Bronze drives deep into divine flesh, and Sekhmet howls in pain
>"AAAAAAAAAAAUGH! HOW DARE YOU MAR A GODDESS?!"
>Unable to maintain balance, Sekhmet topples over and lands on her back, clouds of sand rising over her fall
>You take this opportunity to sprint over to Sekhmet's upper half and make Hogan proud
>A devastating leg drop, delivered to the giantess's throat
>Sekhmet hacks and coughs in pain, clearly affected by your dynamic move
>Meanwhile, you wince for your lower spine as you remembered that Hogan regretted making the leg drop his signature move
>You try your best to pin her, making sure she doesn't try anything funny
>However, it seems like you have won
>As Sekhmet's breathing begins to steady, the desert around you slowly dissipates, her domain breaking apart
>Her size begins to shrink as well, changing from a menacing titan to human heights
>The city comes back into view, and your regular clothes return
>You sigh in relief as you roll onto the solid ground
>Well, you did it
>You could cross, "wrestling a deity", off your bucket list now
>Well, what now?
>Requests are tricky; you were asked to, "keep her out of harm", so taking her back home will do
>Hopefully, the old man, Ra, will have the lioness picked up soon
>Readying yourself, you heft the retired Sekhmet onto your shoulder
>She's heavier than she looks, caused by her fit body
>A pair of lion breasts press against you upside-down, and you heed your lower half to behave itself
>Which you would have an easier time doing so when there aren't tits next to you 
>You're met with a light cough from your passenger, "Ugh. Unhand me, son of man."
>Nope, you've bested her, so she will comply
>An annoyed "hmph" is all you get
>You smirk
>The prideful warrior type, then
>Well, her voice has lost its previous boom, so she wouldn't cause any major ruckuses if she did
>Hopefully
>On your way back, you feel multiple glances towards your direction
>Fortunately, no one has confronted you on what you were doing thanks to your large frame
>Reaching your apartment, you lumber inside nonchalantly
>Mi casa es su casa, or whatever
>You set Sekhmet down in the living room, who seems to have recovered from your bout with her
>She stares at you, expecting, and you can't help but to stare back into her cerulean eyes and admire her features
>Unlike the many depictions of Cleopatra, Sekhmet's black hair is choppy and unruly, her golden headdress barely containing the fluff
>Thinking back to Ra referring to her as a kitty, you suddenly feel the urge to pet her, but you fight back 
>While part animal(and demon), what's in front of you is most definitely a woman, defined by her feminine aspects
>Her narrow shoulders
>Her modest-sized breasts, their undersides peeking out of her top
>Those toned, yet soft-looking thighs
>"Do as you like with me," the lioness snaps at you
>What?
>"It is as you said," Sekhmet replies, "I am now your prisoner. I have n-no right to fight back your...advances."
>The goddess's body language speaks differently, crossing her legs and looking away from you, a faint blush appearing on her face
>You are shamelessly erect
>C'mon, don't do it
>Don't risk fucking up the request
>Don't do anything hasty
>Sekhmet steals a glance at you, noticing your tent
>Her eyes widen like dinner plates, clearly in shock
>DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT WILL RISK YOUR DICK GETTING SEVERED BY ANCIENTS
>A doorbell rings through the space, cutting through the thick sexual tension
>WONDERFUL, SOMEONE IS AT THE DOOR
>You rush over to the entrance and swing open the door, praying whoever's on the other side does not notice your stiffy
>To your relief and slight confusion, no one is there to greet
>Looking down, a neat-looking letter contrasts against the complex's aged floors
>It's addressed to you in beautiful cursive, and flipping it over reveals a wax stamp, a strange logo depicting the Eye of Horus etched into it
>You tear the envelope open on the spot; inside it, you first take out- oh shit
>That's a big check
>Signed with an eloquent "R", just for you
>Looks like you wont have to answer any exorcisms for a month
>Along it, you pull out a cutesy looking thank-you card 
>On it, a cartoon falcon wearing a Pharaoh's hat gives you a feathery thumbs up
>Cheeky
>It reads, 'Thank you for wrangling in my daughter. She could be a feisty one, huh? Unfortunately, these old bones are having trouble these days, so I would appreciate a strapping young'un like you to take care of her. In exchange, you'll be receiving more payments for compensation. Just be careful- I'd say she's more old-fashioned than I am!     -Ra'
>A little slip is attached to the bottom of the card
>'P.S. Make my princess happy. Or else.'
>You prefer not finding out what "Or else" could spell for you
>Sekhmet is still wary of you when you step back inside
>Her golden fur stands on end, making her look like a doll that sat in the dryer for too long
>The messy bed-head of her's puff into an almost afro-like shape
>You pull out Ra's card and show her the falcon mascot
>She seems to understand, and her features relax
>"Of course," the goddess mutters under her breath as you hand her the card
>You decide to ask Sekhmet about her relationship with Ra
>"Fool. I may be daughter to that dung beetle of a king, but gods are not bound to familial ties, like mortals. Brother and sister, sons and mothers alike participate in each other's flesh with little thought."
>Ew
>"However," a wave of the hand later, and the card bursts into flames, "although Ra is an imbecile, he is right about one thing. The sons of man have moved faster than this goddess, and my years of isolation has done me little good."
>"I," Sekhmet seems to struggle, "I would appreciate you. Being an escort, I mean."
>Shit, you can't say no to those eyes
>For the first time you've been with her, the lioness smiles
>"Thank you, human."
>Well, the night is still young, so the two of you can head out and explore the city
>However, your goddess needs to...cover up
>You quickly rummage through your closet and pull out the largest piece of clothing you have
>A black, faded-out Yes T-shirt
>Various stretch marks on it reminds you of harder times 
>The lioness glances at you with confusion as you hand it to her
>"I see that the sons of man have changed their ideals," she says as she stuffs her head into the fabric
>The oversized shirt hangs loosely off of her frame, nearly reaching the bottom of her skirt
>She looks like a gym rat(cat?) who just got out of bed
>Sekhmet sniffs at the cloth, "It reeks of you."
>Taking handfuls of the shirt, she begins to take in your scent
>The shirt is lifted, and you're provided a good view of the goddess's defined stomach
>Even though you've seen her abs before, it's somehow much more stimulating this way
>You clear your throat, and Sekhmet is knocked out of her trance
>"Oh uh," she lets go of the cloth, "sorry."
>She blushes, and your heart twinges at the cuteness
>Fuck it, you're gonna do it
>You stretch out your hand and pet Sekhmet
>Her messy bedhead is surprisingly soft, your fingers lost in the furry mass
>She's confused by your gesture, ears twitching
>As you shift to the back of her ears, you hear little mewls come out of the lioness
>Slowly leaning into your hand, she shuts her eyes and let you do your work
>Like putty, this war goddess melts in your grip, playfully purring while her golden trinkets jingle
>When you finish, she lets out a sigh
>"You know, you are quite the warrior to handle me with such confidence."
>Sekhmet stands, and you take note her wounded paw
>Wouldn't it hurt for her to get up?
>"Hm? I am fine," she lifts her leg to show you her paw pads
>As stated, there is not a trace of a scar from your jab
>"As goddess of war and plagues, I also control medicine," she says smugly, "no wound is too deep for me to mend."
>She should add goddess of flexibility on that list, too; that leg has gone well above her head, and the lioness has not lost her balance
>Her skirt and shirt have ridden up, though, and you're given an ample view of...
>Sekhmet seems to connect the dots, and her face flares up
>She immediately plants both legs firmly into your ground and pulls her shirt down
>"F-Forget this ever happened!"
>You nod at inhuman speeds while silently praying for your floorboards
>Let's leave while the night is young
>"Yes. Lets."
>Well, time to show her the new world
>By the time you two stepped out of the complex, the sun had already set
>What would be a starry night is shrouded by the cityscape
>Your partner, however, is stunned
>Sekhmet is especially taken aback by the neon signs littering the streets
>"Such glow! At night, no less! The streets are filled with citizens, as though it was Ra's day!"
>While you step into the busy streets, your partner hasn't moved from her spot
>There's a lost look in her eyes, like a kitten separated from her mother
>You offer a hand to the goddess
>If she's hesitant about setting out, you wouldn't mind being closer
>"I wish to see more glamour of the city," she grips your hand firmly, "and you will guide me."
>You chuckle at her excitement
>How about some food first?
