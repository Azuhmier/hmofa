REST AWHILE

>Be Anon
>You look over at your bedside clock, checking the time. 
>It was 11:47 P.M.
>It was late December, the temperature outside sitting at a solid 12° Fahrenheit. There was a snowstorm outside, fat flurries of snow visible through the window as they fell.
>Currently, you were at your girlfriends house, laying in her bed.
>The two thin blankets she used didn't really help you stay warm, and it felt like your toes were about to turn blue and fall off.
>If you were being honest, it was pretty cold in the room. You were really wishing you hadn't taken your socks off...
>Your girlfriend kept it cool in her apartment, citing that her winter coat of fur kept her warm enough. She didn't have much need to waste money heating the home when she was already comfortable as it was.
>The only issue was you. Unfortunately, Humans didn't really have any natural methods of keeping warm...
>You put up with it though, your love for your fluffy gf bigger than your discomfort. 
>You could hear your girlfriend in the bathroom adjacent to the bedroom, using her fur drier. She had wanted to take a quick shower, leaving you alone and cold in the bed for the last 25 or so minutes.
>You shivered, the cold easily penetrating the thin cotton blankets.
>The sound of the fur drier stops, prompting you to watch the door, eagerly awaiting your girlfriend's warm embrace. She always made this all worth it.
>Sure enough, the door clicks open, your beautiful girlfriend walking into the room.
>She was fully nude, her immaculate, stark white fur being lit up by a beam of moonlight coming through the window.
>Slowly, she walks over to her side of the bed, her clawed toes softly clacking against the wooden floor.
>When she peels back the blankets, you pull your legs up, trying your best to hold onto the little warmth the blanket had kept trapped.

>When your girlfriend slides into bed next to you, you let out an instinctive sigh, her soft fur rubbing against your arm.
>She gives you a smile warmer than her fur, tossing the blanket back over the two of you.
>She reaches for your hand, gently gripping it. She gives a small look of alarm when she feels how cold you are.
>"Nonny? You a bit cold?"
>You only smile and nod at her, telling her that you were fine now that she was here. As you speak, you can see your breath in the air.
>She only huffs at you, pawing at your side and rolling you on your side to face her.
>The two of you scooch close together, your fronts pressing together.
>Her white coat was freshly dried, her fur drier making it all poofy.
>When she takes hold of your shirt, trying to tug it off, you try to protest a bit. She quickly hushes you with a kiss, one of her warm hands brushing against your cheek as she calms you. 
>Reluctantly, she pulls away for a breath of air, before softly whispering in your ear, her warm breath tickling your neck.
>"Shhh... Don't worry, I'll keep you warm... Poor, poor, furless Anon..."
>You relax as she pulls your shirt off, tossing it to the floor.
>Her arms wrap around you, pulling the two of you close together. 
>You gasp as the warmth of her fur radiates into your body, her soft breasts smooshing against your chest.
>Her fur rubs against your chest, lending you her body heat, warming you to the core within minutes.
>As she wiggles against you, her scent fills your nose. She smelled of floral shampoo, along with the more subtle smell that her fur naturally held. It was a deeply pleasant smell, one that you've become deeply acquainted with over the previous few years.
>It brings back certain special memories you've made together in this bed...
>You're brought back down to Earth by the sound of her sniffing at you, her cold nose poking at your neck.
>When she's done trying to inhale your neck, she puts a hand on the back of your head, guiding your face into its proper resting place in the tuft of fur between her breasts.
>You go limp as the combined warmth, smell, and feeling of her fur overwhelms your senses.
>A quiet giggle escaping her, she rolls you over on your back, quickly laying on top of you so no warmth can escape.

>As she lays on top of you, she lazily licks at your face and neck, before rubbing her fuzzy head against the same areas, effectively painting you with her scent.
>She stops to kiss you again, her tongue delving into your mouth.
>When she pulls away, she presses her head against your face, a light whine leaving her body.
>"Nonny... You, um, mind helping me out? I have an itch..."
>She pasues to give you another warm kiss on your forehead. 
>"I know you're tired... I promise to be gentle."
>You give your response by pulling your shorts down.
>Your girlfriend sighs happily as she feels your swelling length slide in between her hips as she eases herself down.
>"Thank you Nonny~..."
>She slowly grinds back and force against your length, spreading her slick juices over her shaft as it dribbles  out of her steaming folds.
>When she feels that you've been sufficiently lubed up, she gently grips your throbbing shaft, angling it towards her tight slit.
>As she slowly drops her hips, her hot folds swallowing your length, she reaches out and takes your hands.
>When your hips finally meet, she lets out a satisfied sigh, rolling her hips as she interlocks her fingers with yours.
>She settles into a slow, steady rhythm, smiling at you as she takes you for a ride.
>As her hips slowly rise and lower, she keeps leaning forward to lick your face and kiss you, whispering in your ear how much she loves you.
>The session lasts for nearly 45 minutes. 45 minutes spent blissed out, holding hands with your wolfess girlfriend as the two of you make love.
>She lets out several soft moans, speeding up a bit.
>When she finally reaches her climax, she makes it known, throwing her head back and howling, squeezing your hands.
>Her insides clench around you, milking you of your seed as you fill her womb like a proper mate.
>She flops forward onto your chest, a wide, blissed out smile on her face.
>"Mmm... Thank youuuu Nonnyyyyy..."
>She rolls off of you, your dick popping out as a thin stream of your combined fluids leaks out of her.
>She pulls you close, wrapping you in a warm hug as she kisses and licks at your face.
>Your head is pressed back into her soft, sweet-smelling fur as she gets the two of you comfortable.
>You're pulled close as she presses her nose into your hair, taking in your scent.

>The two of you cuddle for a bit, smiles on both of your faces.
>She falls asleep before you do, a grin remaining on her face even as she snoozes.
>Her soft arms hold you tight, keeping you safe and secure in her grasp.
>You happily sigh, closing your eyes as you relish her warm hug.
>It doesn't take long for you to fall asleep, the last thoughts you have being that of your love for the wolf-woman laying next to you.
