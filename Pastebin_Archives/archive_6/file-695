>It started off pretty mundane
>Your fox neighbor across the street looked like she could use a hand carrying in some groceries
>Being the neighborly, friendly person you are, you offered to help
>You could swear she was undressing you with her eyes right then and there, but, it was hard to tell. Foxes always have 'that look'
>Casual conversation across the fence whenever you happen to run into each other outside
>You learn a bit more about her. She's divorced and her kid has since moved out on his own
>Her sardonic sense of humor and direct way of speaking, surprisingly, does not immediately put you off
>You actually kind of like her
>Invite her over to crack a cold one on the porch one Saturday evening
>She takes a sip of her whiteclaw and gazes at you with piercing eyes. "So what's your deal, huh? Single guy, mid 30s, homeowner with no chick. Something I should know about you?"
>You laugh and play along. "Witness protection. I've already said too much."
>Tell her about yourself. High school sweetheart left you and you lost half of everything in the divorce.
>Passionate about what you do for work, don't really find much time to get to know people
>Your neighbor, who you now know to be Katja, takes another sip and stares you dead in the eyes with that coy look. "Sounds like a real bitch. Shoulda gone to school with me."
>Your heart does a cartwheel. You've never really considered an anthro up until now, but this fox has you curious.
>You jokingly dip and duck around subtle hints like this for the rest of the evening until she wraps it up
>She places a hand on your knee, chuckles and shakes her head
>She gets up, but before slipping into the night, calls over her shoulder, "Text me. It gets lonely out here in the suburbs."
>Notice a little piece of paper with her number sitting on your knee
>Damn, she's good

---------

>Come home after a long day at work
>Reach into the fridge for a cold one
>Nothing there
>Text Katja and ask if you can cop one of her drinks
>Your phone buzzes
>"Be here in 15. Hope your calendar is clear"
>Looks like your book is going to have to wait
>Show up at Katja's door in 15 as instructed
>Knock
>"Come in, door's unlocked. Show's starting."
>You let yourself in and find Katja in the living room under a blanket
>Stare like an idiot
>She doesn't take her eyes from the TV "Well? You gonna come watch this with me or no?"
>You already know where this is headed
>Walk over to the couch and take a seat next to the vixen
>She immediately includes you in the blanked cocoon and leans into your body
>You can't tell for sure, but it doesn't feel like she's wearing much
>But you do know that you're really into this fox, and her gentle embrace has you feeling something you haven't felt in a decade

--------

>All through the show you can feel her gently tracing a claw over your stomach
>At one point she rests her head on your shoulder with a content sigh
>Falls asleep just like that
>Thank god. You're beyond aroused and don't want her to 'stumble' across it.
>You take the time to appreciate her beauty
>Those perky ears
>Her long whiskers
>Tiny little nose... That faint musk about her fur
>You actually enjoy the awkward 7 minutes of not knowing what to do after the show ends
>Finally you pretend to stretch, as if just waking up yourself
>Katja stirrs and looks up at you with the tiniest of smile. "Did I miss it?"
>You chuckle and give her a recap before sitting upright in the couch
>Do that awkard sigh/stretch as you look towards the front door
>Stand and muse while stretching, "Weeeelll, it looks like it's getting late. I guess I better get out of your fur, huh?"
>As you stand, the blanket falls from Katja's shoulders to reveal the foxy figure wearing nothing but panties and a sports bra
>She makes no attempt to cover herself back up
>That look, there it is again.
>You feel your stomach flutter as her paw lazily traces a line down to her waistband
>"Leaving so soon, Anon...?"
