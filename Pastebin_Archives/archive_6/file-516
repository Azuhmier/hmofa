>tfw transported to a strange fantasy world
>Found, gravely injured, by a hunting party from a large tribe of anthro wolves
>Wary of you, they treat your wounds and nurse you back to health
>Can't understand them, but you make do with gesturing and body language
>You "communicate" with one of their shamans, and learn that their omens made them take you in, instead of ignoring you
>Village seems wary of you still, yet you can't quite discern the atmosphere
>Maybe they're simply alien in their signals and tone of voice
>With your health returning, you motion that you want to help out here and there in the village
>Every one of them is larger than you, with even the females muscular and fit
>But you have something else with you
>Bit by bit, you demonstrate simple mechanical solutions, and---through motions and gestures---convey simple facts of medicine and science
>Their feral muzzled faces gape in amazed awe as they realize that everything you show them works
>Their shamans ask you more and more for help
>You start learning a few words of their language
>Communication is hard, but you realize they hang on your every word
>Every lupine ear turn to you and all muzzles fall deathly silence every time you so much as utter a word
>Every syllable you make to them an omen of significance, as they're now realizing
>Males start bringing you gifts of honour, wanting you to bless their spears and arrows
>Females want you to either bless their newborn
>You solemnly shake your head and point silently towards the shamans
>Gotta be smart, after all
>Some make romantic advances towards you, but your solemn silence still makes them uncertain and wary
>That is, until you reciprocate the advances of a spirited young female
>by gently but firmly catching her tail in your mouth just as she's about to leave
>Like a bubble popping, every wolf in the tribe knows they can treat you as one of their own

>They start talking to you a whole lot more (even when you can't understand it all), bring you gifts, etc
>Lots of flirting, but you play it cool like the coy trickster, only reciprocating when you feel like it
>(Mostly because there are social regards and traditions you still don't know about)
>You have your own hut now, built by the villagers.
>Every day they bring you gifts in thanks of all the help you give them
>In turn, you help the shamans, the chieftain, and of course the villagers
>They never ask you for physical help, since they know such things would be a waste
>You still do it now and then, however, as a gesture of good will
>Even their largest warriors now, capable of lifting thrice what you can, show you the respect of a shaman
>After half a year, you've learned enough of their strangely guttural but graceful language to learn about this strange new world..
>The wolves are of a valley tribe some ways from civilization
>This world is civilized, however.
>They manage to convey to you knowledge of other tribes
>(from what you can guess, based on other animals)
>Also, far-off cities of wood and stone, inhabited by the lizardpeople 
>From what you gather, they seems to be at a bronze-age equivalent level of technology
>Your strategical advise to the chieftain helps the tribe too:
>You show them how to use light signals off of polished rocks to communicate
>You devise a simple light-language that the tribe's scattered villages start using
>You show them rudimentary agriculture, and how much more efficient it is than hunting/gathering
>You teach them ruthlessly effective tactics in small-unit combat
>This causes some of the warriors to watch you in a horrified light
>Your words to allay their concern will remain with them for a long, long time:
>"For tribe to live, all is permitted."
>One night, you're humbly asked to help the seeress of the tribe;
>An old blind wolf female, old eyes dusty with cataracts
>First time you're allowed in her cave.

>They seemed reluctant to let you enter, and have been very little forthcoming in telling you anything about her or the cave
>It's constantly guarded, the entrance solemnly and humbly decorated
>You can smell powerful incense as you near it, the warrior guards kneeling to you and making a sign of reverance
>(There are still many who does that, even still. Huh.)
>You help the seeress with a few small things, her gauging you allwhile
>You can feel it, even through her obvious blindness
>She eventually tells you of a ritual, and shows you how to help her perform it
>A ghastly thing, of rabbit entrails, foul smelling black oil, and hoarse strange words and fervent gestures from the old wolfess
>You do your part, however.
>Then you sense it
>Something's wrong.
>The tallow-lamps flicker and there's a sound in your ears
>An unexplainable pressure in the cave's deep chamber
>Your pulse skyrockets as you realize you're witnessing something supernatural
>..and you're all the more cautious when she moves to get a drop of your blood.
>You're still deciding whether to stop her, when she finishes drawing a quick and painless droplet from your wrist
>She uses it in an augur of some kind
>You can hear It talking to her, and see the writhing rabbit entrails shrivel up and start smoking
>After a bit, you're sent off, with a quick thanks
>You're still shaking when you try to sleep
>Jesus Christ
>
>The following weeks, you're asked to help her more and more
>She seems to be trying to teach you as much of her art as possible
>After a few months, you've grown fully accustomed to her strange rituals
>Whether magical or spiritual, there's obvious potential here.
>No longer unnerved, you learn of their spirit lore and ways, as well the closely guarded secrets of the seers
>The other villagers start treating you with more respect again
>Their solemn reverence not only unnerves you, it's also boring
>To loosen the mood, you flirt with a fierce female warrior at a feast..

>Her surprise only lasts for a few heartbeats, before she reciprocates
>Carousing to the best of your ability, you dance and sing-howl with the others
>The atmosphere is wonderful
>Not as wonderful as the three hundred pounds of grey, athletic, lustful wolfess following you to your tent, however
>Both slightly damp from the cooling evening drizzle, you lose yourselves in eachother's scents and bodies
>You take your time exploring her, finally getting to know their race's final secrets
>She adores every second of scrutiny, panting aroused as you run your hands all over her
>Then you make love.
>She's primal, her uncivilized wild lovemaking almost mistakeable for inexperience
>You show her a thing or two of patience, though
>(Not really having had any relief since you got here, you want to stretch it out anyway)
>You fail miserably as her clenching tight velvet folds squeeze around you
>Her strength and size leaves you no choice in the matter as she rides you, hot breath huffing over your face
>It doesn't take long before you're ready to go again, however.
>..and again
>..and again..
>The night not only leaves you sleep deprived, but also with memories you'll take a long time forgetting
>The tribe seems rather frivolous in regards to sexuality, however
>Casual sex, and mating/bonding are two different matters, and those unmated sleep with eachother now and then
>(Their knowledge of hereditary biology ends at "love-parents are true-parents")
>It seems there are taboos associated with offering to become the mate of the seer, though
>..and they seem to be treating you thus.
>More and more, you learn of the seeress' mysterious ways
>Most importantly, you learn how their hopelessly muddled spiritual lore is like a blind toddler grasping at straws
>Hindering at best, counterproductive at worst.
>You can't shatter their worldviews, naturally.
>Still.. Two months after having divined---and thus "spoken" with---your first augur, you devise your own ritual..

>Having the seeress as an aide, and taking great care in your precautions and preparations,
>you devise a ritual to change the weather.
>..Should be simple enough;
>Source, afflict, sense-capping for attunement, then stabilize the conduit, then "yowruhn" (worded according to the Principles)
>Your legs almost give out beneath you as the huge hyalodont skull glitters, and a roar is heard
>..and you start breathing again as you hear and feel the first of the resounding thunderbolts from outside the cave
>According to your guesses, the mighty skull - painstakingly acquired and cleaned - is unmarred, ready for use again.
>The seeress "looks" at you like you're something from another world (heh)
>The drought ended a whole lot sooner than it had began
>And the tribe was told that you made it so
>The seeress' concern evaporates quickly, causing you to suspect that this was her hope all along
>She confers with the chieftain.
>He hosts a grand ceremony, and gives you a wonderfully decorated spear he's made himself
>He proclaims to the entire tribe's gathered masses that there are two things guiding them
>The spear of the body
>And the spear of the spirit
>..and those two shall be like unto brothers.
>The tribe howls, roars and cheers as he kneels to you and demonstrates that he'll forever accept your spiritual guidance.
>You know your part as well.
>You kneel, and proclaim that you'll forever accept his warrior leadership.
>Thus the tribe---for the first time in their history---had two seers, and one of them male.
>...
>Well. Now you definitely couldn't help out with simple physical chores anymore.
>Oh well, there was still the occasional flirt and dalliance
>Even a few of their males tried to entice you into sexual advances
>It seemed the tribe was pretty open-minded in that regard as well
>You didn't really swing that way
>..but you can't admit you weren't charmed when petting the effeminate head of a sleek male, his body subserviently slumped against you and tail wagging.
>All good times must end, however.
>The heavily wounded scout had the entire tribe in a frightened frenzy when he returned.

>Like every living thing, even on Earth, the wolves wanted nothing more than to remain alive.
>The surviving scout, deranged from the horrors he'd seen, told of an attack..
>A nearby tribal settlement had been assaulted by another tribe of felines.
>Primitives weren't known for subtlety and grace, even in this place, it seemed
>They had killed nearly half the male warriors, taking the women and children as slaves, as well as stealing the food stockpiles and winter storages
>From what the chieftain tells you, there was supposed to be peace.
>For many years, the two tribes have appeased eachother with symbolic gifts, leaving eachother to their respective lands.
>Even as the tribe scurried into something resembling war preparations, you conferred with the chieftain.
>Laying down plans for assault, surprising him again and again with what must only seem like odd suggestions
>..Then having him perk his ears and widen his eyes as you explained the reason for these suggestions.
>Over the course of a few weeks, the main village and surrounding settlements were more prepared than they'd ever been
>Sub-hierarchies of rank made them more organized than ever 
>Only by strict commands from the chieftain could this be realized
>It seemed, after all, absurd and pointless to the wolves.
>As the first war-parties moved, however, realization struck them one by one;
>There was reason behind every logistical decision, purpose to every order
>They were more efficient than they'd ever been.
>You came along with the war parties, along with the chieftain.
>When you came upon the outlying feline-tribe village, you told them of how it should be attacked
>Fury still in their lupine fierce eyes, they took to your orders without question
>There was no open declaration of combat
>No honourable duels or open battle on some fields
>With horrible precision, some groups cut their watchers down in the dark of night as another group started a distraction elsewhere

>..Yet others ran for their leaders immediately.
>Divide and conquer
>It was a ruthless battle, won even with fewer numbers.
>Of the captive females and pups, only a handful was recovered, however.
>The rest had been taken to the main feline village.
>You sent a messenger, one of their own, with terms demanding the return of the captives.
>In turn, you'd give them those captured in the assault. An eye for an eye, tit-for-tat.
>Holing up in the now claimed and fortified feline village, it took only a little over a week for the response
>A single wolf pup, partially skinned, only partially sane, limping towards the fortified village, eyes mad
>He mumbled awkwardly, repeating a single message
>"No quarter for the heathens. Know your place. No quarter for the heathens. Know your place."
>He had a large sack with him
>It was full of pulled teeth and claws.
>Still bloody.
>All lupine in origin
>The warrior wolves around you cried in rage and despair
>And you
>You hadn't been mad since coming to this world. Not truly.
>Those times you had been frustrated, you'd kept it inside, whether for appearance or for some odd out-of-place politeness
>Now your blood burned with a mad, mad rage
>All-consuming, it burned in your mind
>Face contorted in rage, you couldn't help but roaring the vilest of defiling curses and threats
>All in your language from Earth
>The wolves shied away from you, not understanding a word
>They knew how you felt about things, though.
>..and with a hundred plans and ideas flooding your mind,
>each one more abhorrent and ruthless than the last,
>you were certain the felines would know it too before long.

>It took a day's conference to calm the furious hearts and formulate a plan
>The tortured and half-mad pup was sent back to the wolf tribe's village with an escort.
>You thought shamelessly of whatever evils to afflict upon the feline tribe
>With the bloody teeth and claws, ripped from the pups and females, you'd been given a mighty gift.
>The Principalities, the tally-of-soil, the-.. well, what you've come to call primary potency..
>... all things you'd learned coined from the schooling of the seeress, then expanded upon
>along with some rudimentary calculations..
>it all added up in horrifying arithmetics;
>That sack of teeth and claws would need only a slight mystical caress;
>A word, a few symbols of Luring, a blood sacrifice touched to forehead and heart..
>And the "spirits"---though you've grown less and less fond of using that term---would go absolutely haywire.
>Never had any of the tribe's previous seers done anything even remotely similar.
