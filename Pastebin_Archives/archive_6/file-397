You are Anon, a squire working for Magna of the Wolf Clan.
Mighty and unbreakable, she's many things: The Shieldfury, the leader of the Iron Guard, a great warrior, and a legendary hero.
And now Queen can be added to that list.
You, however, have nothing so grandiose. It almost feels like a mistake that you were picked to serve under her.
You couldn't swing a sword and you weren't cunning or in tune with the Wyld. All you seemed good at was carrying her things.
Worse yet, Magna always seemed to look down on you with that piercing gaze and judging frown of hers.
This pressure weighed on you for several years. Then the quest for the throne happened.

Through some small miracle, you survived long enough through the days of political intrigue, backstabbing, and Bane fighting to witness Magna defeat the king in mortal combat.
A surprising, but not unexpected outcome.
And now here you are, the same as when you started. As you sit in your quarters, tracing the rim of your goblet, you think of what's going on right now.
The coronation wasn't for several weeks, the settlements were rebuilding after large sections were terrorized and razed in the old king's name, and the unsuccessful heroes were returning home.
So why were you still here?

You haven't recieved any sort of compensation from her or the clan.
Does she revel in watching you suffer?
What does she get from keeping you at the castle?
Shaking these thoughts away, you decide the only way to get any answers is to ask her yourself.
You down the rest of you drink for a boost of courage.

You open the door and are about to leave when you bump face-first into what feels like a solid wall of muscles. Which can only mean one thing...
Magna is already here. You aren't short, but she practically makes you look like it by comparison. 
She looks only somewhat apologetic. "Anon." she speaks in that gruff voice of hers.
"M-Magna! I-I mean, my Queen!" you stammer out. Looks like alcohol has finally failed you.
The massive wolf holds her hand out to stop you from potentially humiliating yourself. "Enough. I need to speak with you alone."
"Here?" You panic at the thought of her discovering your stash of booze.
"No, my quarters. We need to have a private discussion, you and I." She turns away and leaves you alone.
Maybe she'll explain in the meeting.

As you travel the halls, you notice something strange. There's no guards anywhere.
You rationalize that they're either off-duty or sleeping in the barracks, but for all the guards to not be here?
Reaching the door to the royal quarters, you pray desperately that nothing bad will happen to you.
Entering, you see the large bed that used to belong to the king, the banners, the dresser with the shattered spirit stone, but no Magna.
"At last, we're alone." That unmistakable voice is coming from the open door to the darkened royal bath. "Now there's no one to interupt what I'm about to do with you."
Oh fuck.
Her heavy footsteps slowly draw closer to you as Magna enters the bedchambers.
She's... wearing lingerie?!
It's red and the patterns on the bra and panties resemble flowers. The garterbelt seems to barely fit over her wide frame. In fact, the same can be said about the bra, as her nipples are just barely peeking out from it.

"What the hell is this, Magna?!" You shout, the shock of this sight causing you to forget this is the Queen in front of you.
She looks worried. "Is there something wrong with the color? I can pick a different one-"
"That's not what I meant! Why are you dressed like this? Why did you bring me to your bedroom? Why..." You tear up.
"... is someone like me still here?" Your emotions take precedence over rational thinking. "Is this a joke to you? Do you take enjoyment in tormenting me? Tell me why the Heroine of Armello would keep a talentless squire by her side for so long!"
Magna just looks at you. Then she slowly walks over to you.
Now you've done it.
You shut your eyes as you wait for her to do something to you.
You feel her fur pushed against your face, but it's not from where you expected.
Opening your eyes, you find yourself sandwiched between her breasts in a hug.

Heat rises to your face from a mixture of your prior frustration, embarrassment, and the warmth of Magna's fur.
You try to say something, but only get a mouthful of fluff. Attempting to push yourself away is futile since this is Magna we're talking about.
The only thing you can do is calm down. Shutting your eyes again, you breathe as the wolf strokes your head.
Finally, you open your eyes to see her smiling at you. You feel her hand on the back of your head as she pulls you in for a kiss.
The kiss ends and you stare. "I don't understand."
"You're here because I like you and you're the only one I trust to do this." She puts you down and sits on the bed. "I need you to... Gah, this is embarrassing..."
Magna tears her panties off and spreads her legs apart, putting her bare crotch on display. "Put a baby in me!"

You can hardly believe what you're seeing, the Queen is demanding you impregnate her and wants YOU to do it.
Looking at her body, her large breasts are barely being contained by the lingerie and her pussy is getting wetter from you looking at her.
Little Anon seems to like it, at least. Your pants tighten as you feel sweat on your face.
Though your thoughts conflict, you still end up removing your clothes and approaching her.
"Is this really okay?" you ask.
"Yes, now t-take your sword and plant it in my sheathe!" she yells just a little too loudly.
You chuckle. Despite Magna's many talents, it seems talking dirty isn't one of them.

You penetrate her somewhat easily. Blood drips from her vagina.
You, of all people, have just taken Magna's maidenhead.
Even though she lost her virginity, the wolf keeps a brave face and encourages you to keep going.
As you fuck her, Magna turns her head away from you and produces faint moans. You consider moving slower, but she speaks up.
"N-No, I can take it, I'm still Unbroken."
Yet you took her virginity regardless. Is there a title for that?
You resume fucking her when she suddenly moves away from you and further onto the bed.
"If you're going to be doing all the work, I might as well make myself more comfortable, Anon." she says smugly. All that's missing is a smile.

You move onto the bed and penetrate her, but as you do, you are pulled into a tight hug.
"Hahah! You fell into my trap!" Magna yells, watching you struggle against her arms.
Unlike last time, however, your arms are free, so you take the opportunity to grope her breasts.
Magna only smiles and flexes slightly, squishing you between them.
Now all you can do is focus on thrusting.
It's getting harder to breathe, but how good her pussy feels is overwhelming your mind.
You're drenched in sweat by the time you finally climax. Magna's hold on you weakens as she lets out a moan.
Once you're done, you pull out and collapse onto her arm.

Magna holds you close as you gaze into her eyes. "Feeling better, Anon?"
You nod, "Yes. It's probably going to take a few more tries, though."
"For you to be more confident or me to get pregnant?"
"Hmmm, both I think." You mutter as sleep begins to take you.
As you rest close to your wolf lover, you hear her laugh before joining you.
