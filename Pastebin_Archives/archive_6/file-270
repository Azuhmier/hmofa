>you check your watch again
>No, you didn't fuck up this time
>Deep breath, if she didn't want to see you again, she'd say something
>A lady like that couldn't afford to get by on "maybes" anymore
>Hell she seemed to have her life pretty clockwork
>Probably necessary with her boys
>Finally her van pulls up and you see her park
>You wave, blushing as she gets out
>She already seemed flustered
>"Oh God, I am so sorry! The boys decided it would be funny to hide before the babysitter got there.." 
>She panted and stroked her neck, taking a deep breath
>You smile and move closer to her
>"Easy, I just got here myself, be glad they didn't tape each other to the ceiling or something" you joke
>She gave a half-hearted laugh, oh shit, probably not the best to give her ideas to panic about
>"You're wearing new shoes!" 
>She smiled and touched your shoulder as she nodded "you were right, thank you so much for that recommendation, that website alone saved me so much this week!"
>Yes! Score!
>"So what are we doing first?" She tried to sound excited, a Herculean task for such a tired looking woman
>"First, we're going to a show" you motioned to the large theater down the lane
>"Oh! Did I.. really mention that?" Her surprise at your remembering perked up her ears
>"Oh Anon, really you didn't have to, these tickets must have been so expensive!"
>Not really, when you knew a guy
>"Oh psh, don't worry about that, I wanted to give you something to remember and what kind of guy doesn't treat his... girl?" You stumble over the words
>Autisms. You're not quite sure if it's okay to say "girlfriend" yet
>She giggles, gently taking your arm in her hand
>"I wouldn't mind too much being your girlfriend, rather than your girl but okay"
>"No, that's...uhm, let's go." 
>Be assertive you cockgobbler!

>Inside the massive theater, people were already packed in
>She fidgeted and nibbled her lip
>"Anon...we really don't have to..this place is so crowded.."
>"Where are you looking? Because our seats are just fine" 
>SmoothAnon
>She follows your gesture to a special box seat, and her eyes light up
>SUCCESS! "Oh no! Anon you didn't! Those seats--" 
>"Will be waiting for us, because I bought them for me and a very special lady"
>She grips your arm and smiles
>You made a woman feel special, your own fluttering nerves can suckass
>the show begins and everything is going great!
>Well... almost
>Occasionally you see her check her phone, hard to be stealthy when you're a giraffe
>And you can tell the crying kid who got quickly taken away by his mom made her more uncomfortable
>Finally you stroke her hand, she jumps, but gently taps your hand away
>"It's fine..." Easy to guess what was eating her
>"The boys?" 
>She bit her lip and nodded slowly
>"I'll call and see, give me the babysitters number"
>"No! Anon, please don't I'll--"
>You squeeze her arm and slide away before she can protest more
>She slumps in her seat and tries to watch the show
>"Hello this is a big nerd's phone, what do you want?"
>Which one of her..."Hi swill"
>"Oh! Hey, you're that guy mom likes, a-non right?" "Anon" you little fuck trumpet
>"Whatever, what.." 
>"Gimme that phone you weasel!" Shrieks before another voice "G residence how can I help you?"
>Deep breath "is this the babysitter? How's everything going?"
>"Oh, everything is okay, the boys are a little rowdy but they finished their homework, nothing to worry about!"
>Translation: the shits are currently doing their homework under threat of death and nothing has caught fire, yet.
>"Thank you so much"
>You return to your hot date, who managed to enthrall herself into the show just enough before spotting you
>Her mouth opened as she studied you for signs of panic
>"Easy, everything is fine, the boys are fine" 
>"who answered the phone?" 
>Lietime is primetime
>"The babysitter of course, I could hear swill in the background though"
>She took a deep breath and sighed, clutching her chest "thank goodness"
>You passed!
>She seemed much calmer after this, actually sinking into the seat and laughing along with the audience, letting herself touch you much more

>She definitely seemed to enjoy the show, on the way to dinner
>"...I wish I could move like that, I used to be rather graceful in high school, then...well" she motioned to her body "this and the boys happened just mid college"
>You just nod, taking a small moment to appreciate her...figure
>Damn.
>Instead what comes out is "how does a lovely lady like you end up with 4 boys? You definitely don't look like it"
>Fuckit.
>She snorts and rolls her eyes, giving you a playful shove "liar"
>"Actually 3 boys, Gord is my sister's kid...she uhm...left him with me a few years ago"
>You're guessing it wasn't a voluntary thing from her scowl
>"Swill and Luke are from an ex who I divorced after a year...muff was..." She sighed
>'unplanned' was probably the word she was looking for
>Rather understandable after the stress of suddenly having a new kid and then surprise, a new one
>Probably not the best judgement, but who would have the right mind?

>Thankfully before she can think more over her own mistakes, you pull her out of her funk
>She blinks, looking up
>"El..what? I've..never seen this place"
>Perfect!
>"It's gonna be a little different, but you'll love it, I promise, my own little hole in the wall"
>The place was full, but not completely packed, nice
>Your regular bartender was there too, double nice
>As you get a nice table, she seems distracted by the atmosphere, already smiling and tapping her foot to whatever music was on the Jukebox
>"Order whatever you like"
>She smirks "sure Anon, I'll just get most expensive thing here"
>You shrug, it helps you got paid last week
>"If that's what you want..."
>She bit her lip and narrowed her eyes "and drinks?"
>Jesus how cheap was her last boyfriend?
>"Just don't get too much, gotta drive home to your boys remember?" 
>She smirked, and you're pretty sure her foot lingered down your leg just a little longer as she moved closer to the table
>She calmed after ordering, changing her order to something more reasonable

>After a few drinks, she loosened up, luckily she held her liquids very well, only buzzed even after those massive margaritas they served
>But even that was enough to loosen her up
>She laughed more and was freely stroking your arm
>However, mid-dinner something interesting happened
>She caught eye with...a dart board
>The grin on her face made you twist to look where she was looking
>"Hey Anon....did I ever tell you how good I am with darts?"
>This should be interesting...or fear inducing
>"Uh, no, why?"
>She giggled and swished her large hips over to the board and asked the bartender for a few darts
>"Alrighty..CLEAR A PATH PEOPLE!" She bellowed, probably louder than she wanted.
>The bar moved just enough
>She bounced back to the starting line, looking back at you
>THUNK
>What.
>Her eyes never left you, but there it was, dead bull's-eye.
>She grinned at your shock
>As if to prove it wasn't a fluke, she turned back, paused then covered her eyes
>THUNK.THUNK.THUNK.
>HOLY FUCK.
>Then she started backing up, throwing as she shuffled backwards
>The patrons couldn't help but notice and she quickly got popular
>She nailed every one
>Finally she reached your table, winked at you and curled her tail around a dart
>THUNK
>"Aw damn, always high.." she poured, still landing it in the center
>People had gathered, pretty amazed a tipsy giraffe with her assets could be so fluid and precise
>You weren't sure whether to be amazed or terrified
>What if darts weren't the only thing she could throw with accuracy?
>She broke you out of your thoughts "Anon! Get me more darts, I'm running out!" 
>You get up, why not, she was having a blast showing off for the crowd
>You go to the bar, order one last round and pay the check, from the sound of it, someone else gave her more darts
>The cheers from the bar were deafening
>As you returned however the crowd was a little thick
>"Excuse me! Come on...hey, excuse me" 
>As you shoulder your way through the crowd, a new shout rang out
>"HEY!" her voice...then someone else?
>"... come on.."
>You shove your way through, and see her, pressed against another man!
>But before you could react "Unless you want a few new piercings and attachments, I suggest you remove that hand"
>Oh fuck. You never heard that cold tone before, her kids must piss themselves whenever they get caught
>And looking down, you see the cause
>His hand had been on her ass, quickly lifted...on account of the 4 darts pressing into his crotch
>"I happen to be here with my boyfriend in case you didn't get it limpdick, and we're having a wonderful time thats going to end with sex in a very nice hotel and I'm sure his dick is twice the size of yours! I'm not some barfly floosy you can--oh hey sweetie!"
>The show turned to you
>Wave.png
>"Ha..hi..."
>Really smooth Anon.
>She briefly turned and scowled at the poor bastard who's nuts she was about to nail to the wall, before tossing all of them at the board
>Stomping over after collecting her purse, she put her arms around you
>"Let's go Anon, I don't want to ruin the rest of this good mood"
>and suddenly you were outside
>She moved fast!
>Finally she calmed down and took a deep breath, smiling down at you
>"That place was awesome! We should definitely go there again! Hopefully they'll have less Bozos around next time.." she snorted
>you cough and catch up to her thoughts
>"I'm uh...glad you liked it"
>Not quite how the evening was supposed to go, but nice end result!
>She pulled you close and sighed into your hair before sitting on a bench
>"You're not the first guy I've dated to take me to a bar with jerks in it, don't worry" she smiled
>"You didn't leave me there, that's a plus" she laughed, rubbing her eyes as she leaned back against the metal
>You decide to sit next to her, a gentle hand on her knee bringing her back down to you
>"You okay?" You sigh, she's had such a crappy track record with boyfriends, she deserved something good
>She paused and pulled you closer to her "you've been so nice Anon, taking me different places every time, actually having a car and understanding about the boys.."
>You nodded, despite thinking that was what people who went on dates SHOULD DO anyway
>"Hey" she calls
>You look over, and she pulls you into a warm kiss, lips tugging on yours
>You can taste the alcohol on her lips as you self-consciously lick your own lips accidentally
>She giggles and presses in, her mouth sliding around yours
>Finally she slowly pulls away
>"Nice..." She mumbles, rubbing her lips with her fingers softly
>well that was certainly a pleasant surprise
>But the night wasn't over yet! 
>Especially that sour experience at the restaurant...
>Did she really say she wanted to fuck you?
>Well not... exactly but even in the heat of the moment, you'd take it!
>Gotta keep that feeling
>"How about something sweet?"
>Her large eyes focused you and she squirmed slightly
>"What did you have in mind?"
>Was that... apprehension? Or excitement in her voice?
>Hard to tell
>Fucking streetlamps in your eyes
>"Well I saw an ice cream shop down the street"
>"Oh! Uh, jeez I haven't been to a cream shop without the boys in years..."
>"Far too long then, let's go!"
>She paused before following, once inside, she took a deep breath
>She looked so unsure, it was cute but still
>"Feels weird right? Without the boys?"
>She nodded, chuckling "feels like they've been in my life for forever.."
>"Then it's equally important to make memories for yourself, so you don't forget what it's like to be a person, not just their mom"
>She slowly nodded, smiling
>"That's pretty lame man, what will you and the lady be having?" Said the otter, who was fat
>Do you serve bitch or any other flavor of your lardass?
>"I'll have a small cone, and she can get whatever she wants"
>She chooses a smoothie
>"I gotta try and lose some of this weight!" She motions to her hips and breasts, which jiggle nicely
>The otter, who is a fat bitch, raises an eyebrow and you hear a snort as she turns away
>Trymebitch.
>I'll be serving 42 flavors of your ass
>The otter, who is a fat bitch, cannot read your mind and says nothing
>Your date is simply giddy at the thought of no hassle sweets, no whining or crying, just a sweet treat
>And latched onto you for warmth in the chilly shop
>Damn those breasts must have built in heaters
>Retrieving your items from the still smirking otter, you bite your tongue and make it outside with no bloodshed
>Your lovely giraffe date continues to cling to you with one arm
>"So... back to your car?" 
>She pouts at you, poking your chest firmly
>"No, we're going to your hotel, remember?"
>SHEMEANTIT
>she grinned around her straw at your face and gripped your hand, tugging you into action
>"Alright... ALRIGHT!"
>Bit too much enthusiasm
>"It's why you got a hotel room in the first place right? A lucky guess?"
>Well actually you had work in the area tomorrow and were legitimately worried she might have TOO much to drink from those articles on giraffes and alcohol...
>But you shrug and your dick nods furiously
>"Good, I've been waiting"
>you stumble a little as she tugs you along
>"Waiting?"
>She slows and smiles
>"Of course! You're one of the best boyfriends I've had, you're sweet but genuine, you knew I had kids but didn't run away...I literally had a guy leave me at the bar and run when he heard I had 4 boys, damn cheetah prick"
>You shrug, boys weren't a probably, you were a boy once
>"You didn't try anything the few times we've gone out..."
>She stopped, pulling you directly into her large breasts and leaned down, kissing the top of your head
>"And Everytime someone made a smart comment or even a look, I saw you glaring, ready to defend me, even though you know I can take care of myself" 
>"It's the thought that counts" she released you and suddenly you were in the lobby of your hotel
>She waited patiently for you to get the card to your room
>And by waited patiently, I meant stood behind you, rubbing your neck and shoulders with her soft hands
>Pressing her breasts against you, standing so close you could feel her heat as she gently rubbed against you
>Retrieving the keycard, you both ran to the elevator, she couldn't stop giggling
>Once inside, she grabbed you and pressed you against the wall
>"Tonight has been so nice Anon" her breath was hot in your ear
>Her voice got deeper, huskier as she softly panted
>"Let's end it with a bang.."
>The next thing you felt was a wet mouth around yours, and a very long, hot tongue sliding around your mouth
>She moans softly as you grab her hips for support, pulling her close as your tongues wrestle
>the only thing that stopped you both was the DING of the elevator
>She pulled away suddenly, with a sloppy slurp
>"Oh God! Oop, sorry" she panted, wiping off a bit of her drool rolling down you chin
>You both stumble to your room number, it was hard to pull away from her as she kissed your cheek and neck while impatiently waiting
>Her soft lips running up and down your neck
>Finally the door opens, and she drags you inside
>You thank God the bed was big enough for her
>She starts undressing, pausing long enough to look over her shoulder
>You take that as invitation enough to start undressing yourself
>You barely get your shirt off before she's down to her panties and bra
>And she slides a finger down your chest to get your attention
>"What do you think?"
>And let's her bra fall to the floor, before squeezing and rubbing her breasts
>She laughs "I love the look on every boy's face when I whip these out"
>She casually steps out of her panties and sits on the bed, one leg up as she watches you hurriedly get undressed to join her
>She pulls you in close, sucking and kissing your neck and shoulders, stroking her hands down your body
>Her tongue had free reign, sliding around and tasting every bit of you she could
>You take the moment to grab her breasts, she moans and shivers  lightly as you kiss and drag your tongue around her areolas
>One of her hands gently rubbed and fondled your balls and dick, her leg bent around your hip
>She moved up to your mouth, driving her tongue in
>Enough to at least make you gag a little
>She gasps "sorry!" And you wave her back down "it's fine"
>The giraffe special is what you wanted! You tug her neck down until you both start making out again
>After a few more minutes, she has to pull away, crawling away on the bed, ass up
>Before she could move again, you're on dat ass
>And brother, the ass was fat.
>She gasps and laughs "oh! Ok, not what I was going for.." she snorts
>Her tail curls around your shoulders as you explore around her round ass
>Finally she Gasps and lets out a giggly moan as you find her lovehole 
>Slightly used but no less delicious
>Using her moans and occasional cursing, you do your best to find the good spots before she pulls your new prize away
>"Oh, okay, come on, don't tease me anymore, get in there big man" she wheezes, her pussy drooling like a half-on faucet
>As you ponder the angle of entry, she looks back...
>And laughs enough to shake her and the bed
>"Oh sweetie, here--" she leans back, using a pillow to wipe your face and nose
>Yep, definitely a mom.
>"I can move, we don't have to do it like this"
>"No no, uhmm..hang on"
>And you rush to the closet, they usually have one.... YES.
>She's laying on her side when you return, watching and catching her breath
>She blinks before her eyes light up "you smart boy"
>A wedge pillow, large enough to prop her up and still allow you entry
>She manuvers it under her and lays on her tummy
>"Well? Come on tiger..."
>And after a bit of lubing up, you grab her ass and pull yourself in
>She sighs contently as you both pause
>Her velvet tunnel squeezes around you like a glove make for your cock alone
>Hooking your legs around her ankles for leverage, you start bucking and rocking
>She loves it, especially when your balls slap on her clit, that earns you a sharp squeal of delight the first time
>"Fuuck yes" comes from her buried head under the pillows
>The pumping quickly gets faster and harder, short deep thrusts as you try and push your cock as far inside her as it would go
>She grips the bed and her tail curls while she yells and moans
>The slap and squish of fur, skin and bodily fluids was getting noisy
>You were definitely going to need a shower afterwards
>One of her hands had snaked down to rub her clit furiously, until she finally started bucking against the bed and pillow, grabbing your balls to hold you inside her as her pussy did it's best to milk your shaft
>You finally get close to the end
>In typical porn fashion, you barely manage to mumble out how close you are
>She hears you and with a quickness you didn't think was possible for a girl her size, she pushes you back enough for her to flip around
>You barely get a chance to cool before your cock and balls get engulfed in her hungry mouth
>Tongue coiled around every inch of you, messily pumping and slurping
>She lets you lay down across her throat as you buck into her mouth
>And soon you squeeze her hands, she sucks harder while you moan
>As you wash her mouth with your spunk, since you are laying across her, you get the unique sensation of her swallowing under you, hearing it disappear into her stomach
>Finally she lets you pull away once she's gotten everything she could
>Your clean dick pops from her mouth
>She gasps and moans, still gently squirming in the bed as she mildly rubs herself
>"Mmmfuck hun... definitely good..how about we...WAIT" she jolts up, leaving you on the bed, panting.
>She grabs the bedside clock and curses "FUCK!" before rushing and trying to get dressed
>"I am so so sorry Anon, I..I gotta go, I didn't realize what time it was!" 
>You lazily try and look at the time
>"Oh you gotta go say goodnight to your boys"
>She paused, sighing and running a hand through her messy hair before leaning over and kissing you again
>"Goodnight..my boy" she giggles and ruffles your hair
>"I'll call you when I get home!"
>And she went into the bathroom, then left
>45 minutes later, you get a few texts
>"Sorry for rushing out... nothing was on fire when I got home! Yay...going to bed thinking of you <3"
>Then a picture...of a certain giraffe pussy, spread open to form a heart shape and glistening wet.
>You text back "next time we look for an overnight sitter? Or I know of a good waterpark if the boys are interested, then after, you can show me what your bed sounds like"
