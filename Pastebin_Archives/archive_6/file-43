Prologue : Run Boy Run

>Something changed with the weather, Blizzards hit hard
>what it was was that made them change, you weren't sure but when the snow fell it was radioactive
>VERY Radioactive
>your gieger counter went Crazy whenever you tried to leave your home
>when the snow melted the ground became highly radioactive
>everything died, every plant, every animal and every other person you knew
>most people couldn't get away fast enough, the blizzard hit and buried everything
>And when the first one stopped and the snow melted, you saw another on the horizon to the north
>There was no way you would survive another, and Amana couldn't either
>you had to flee south, away from where it could snow
>As you fled you suffered radiation sickness 
>Your Mate, Amana, a Anthro deathclaw, had to carry you some of the way as you dosed yourself with Rad-x and Radaway just to stay alive
>Your home was left behind, your food, most of your gear
>The two of you fled so quickly that you didn't have time to get most of it
>Your nest with Amana, the walls of safety, all left behind
>It broke your heart to leave it
>You were on Amana's back, weakly holding on as she tore through the wasteland trying to keep ahead of the blizzard
>Radiation barely effected her, if at all
>Where she was going you didn't know, but you told her to keep going until your gieger counter stopped clicking
>She was Smart, and strong but couldn't talk very well, she mostly parroted
>Her leather armor creaked as she ran
>You had made that armor for her during better times, when food was plentiful and animals were easy to find
>How many miles had she carried you? she hadn't stopped for food or rest for longer than a few hours
>You worried as she ran, but she refused to stop until you were safe
>Although when she needed a rest you took care of her held her close and gave her neck scratches
>You would find some abandoned building and hide together in the basements
>You still suffered from the radiation there but cement walls helped insulation
>She scavenged little bits of food for you both while you were incapacitated
>Even when your gieger counter finally stopped clicking she kept going
>Finally when she stopped you were in a sun-licked desert
>She found a cave and left you in it, going out to hunt
>Was this place going to be your new home? a dusty cave in the middle of a desert
>Amana would like it, she hated the cold after all
>You look at you pip boy and look at the location
>The Mojave? You don't know where that is, but youre going to stay for a while


Chapter 1:  Homecoming
>It took a long time for you and Amana to recover completely
>Amana had carried you hundreds of miles and you had radation sickness
>After all you are just a normal human
>Well maybe not normal
>You are Anon, "The deathclaw tamer", "Vault-boy", Or most commonly just "V"
>Not for a cool reason like V for Vendetta
>People just got too lazy to call you vault-boy
>The only reason they call you vault boy is because you wear a blue vault 77 jumpsuit with combat armor over it
>People are not creative with nicknames
>As you recovered, you had to hunt for food
>This place, the Mojave , was warm had low radation and plenty of weird plants that looked safe to eat
>But you didn't know so you stuck to what you normally eat
>Meat
>Amana's diet is exclusively meat, so that made up the biggest part of your diet
>And it seemed like the Mojave has lots of animals
>Big ass lizards, giant wasp things, radscorpions and giant ants
>Those and all thier eggs, the eggs were your favorite
>The cave the two of you had stayed in was homey but didn't have what you and Amana needed
>So you both ventured out as soon as she was able to
>She saved you at the cost of her own health
>She had lost a lot of weight when you had fled, so you took care of her
>Radiation sickness at the minimal levels was a given at times so you learned to function with it
>After all She gave so much for you
>She was walking right next to you  right now as the both of you wander the wastes
>The warm night air blows past, elicting a happy growl from your partner
>A bright city was to the  east, spot lights  paint the sky in light
>You didn't know that places like this existed
>Up north all the settlements were rundown shacks
>"What do you think Amana? Do you like it here in the Mojave? I know you like the warmth"
>"I Like Mojave" She says in her raspy voice
>You nod and pat her side, then push your fingers under her armor and scratch her rough scales
>She gives a gravely purr as you do
>"Lets find a new home, maybe an actual house?"
>She huffs
>"Nest?"
>You keep scratching her scales
>"Of course we'll have another nest like before" you reassure her
>The desert here had ruins to be sure, but there were also lots of buildings from before the war
>Bombs never fell here so its pretty untouched by radiation 
>You don't mind either way
>As long as you had food, water and Anama you would be fine
>"Let me get a scan of the area Amana"
>"OK"
>She lowers her head and shoulders, allowing you to climb up 
>You stand up on her shoulders as she stands up tall
>Unfortunaelty you aren't the tallest guy
>But luckily Amana was about 8 and a half feet tall
>You pull out your Silenced sniper rifle and peer through the scope
>This rifle was one of the few you were able to get before the blizzard hit
>You look around, scanning the horizon for buildings and spot one in the distance
>"Coming down!"
>You jump off Amana's shoulders into her arms
>"Love Anon!" she says as she catches you
>You scratch the side of her jaw gently and she licks the side of your face
>"Love you too, there's a building over there, lets check it out" you say pointing in the direction of the building
>She puts you on the ground and you both walk calmly
>Raiders almost never bothered you anymore
>Guess seeing a deathclaw walking around is a good deterant
>But some animals would attack, and they usually became lunch
>As you and Amana approach the building you peer down the scope again
>A few of those big lizards roam around the door
>"Amana theres are few of those lizards, wanna get us some dinner?"
>She smiles her toothy grin and stomps off in a run
>You watch through your scope as she tears the heads off each one with ease
>You had asked her to try to leave the bodies in tact, lets you get the skin and the meat easily
>She was usually pretty good about it too but sometimes she got a little excited 
>Or like the time she got that rad-wolf and tried to eat it fur and all
>You catch up with Amana and see her happily gnawing on one of the bodies of the lizards
>Well she can have that one you guess
>She was probably hungry anyway
>Now that you're up close, you can see the building is actually a single story house
>Its in pretty decent condition too
>You push open the door and look around
>No one around, not even any spooky skeles; which is perfect
>As you walk in you hear Amana walk though the doorway
>No doubt she has to duck to get in, but she doesn't seen to mind
>"What do you think Amana? We can make a new home here"
>She looks around, the body of the lizard still locked in her jaws
>"Home" she says with a grunt
>The Lizard falls out of her mouth as she talks and lands on the floor with a thud
>You sigh
>"What have I said about talking and eating?"
>She picks up the body in her clawed fingers
>"Hold food in claws" she says looking down sadly
>"You walk over and scratch her head and jaw 
>"It's ok, lets just try not to make our new home a mess"
>She purrs happily and presses her large body against you
>"Amana home with Anon" 
>You smile and continue the scratches 
>"Yes, Home together again"

>You've been in the Mojave for a few months now
>Amana loved it here and you liked it too
>There was plenty of food for you and Amana
>You weren't picky at all, plus who were you to turn down whatever food Amana brought
>During the first few weeks while you cleaned the house up, amana would run off to hunt
>She would come back iwthing a few hours with something to eat
>And while the animals here didn't have much fur you traded with locals for cloth to remake your nest with Amana
>At first you had to leave Amana behind when you traded
>A group you had never run into before was the New California Republic "the NCR"
>They were friendly enough plus they had a camp north of your new home
>They were a bit less friendly when you finally brought Amana in her full set of armor
>She helped you carry stuff so you needed her help
>It took a LOT of talking down and explaining she was friendly as long as no one tried to hurt you
>You never understood ranks but the guy in charge said you could bring her as long as you stayed with her
>The rumors Spread about you once again,
>You were an animal whisperer, a miricle worker, a vault-tec experiment
>Lucky for you Amanas armor hid her large breasts so people couldnt tell she was an anthro
>You stand outside your home, pumping water from the well
>Amana was out hunting but no doubt she would be back soon
>She was often times covered in blood so you had water ready to clean her off
>She liked baths more here, the water was warmer and  so was the air 
>You were able to give her the rubs and scratches she loved with one hand and wash her down with the other
>Other times it got her in to mood for fun too
>But as you pump you hear the sound of footfalls 
>You grasp your 12.7mm pistol 
>Fuck, getting caught out in the open was bad
>Staying far away and shooting bad guys from a distance was more your style
>After all why rush into a fight when Amana would? You would just get in her way
>As the footsteps draw closer you tense up and get ready
>But your nerves are eased when you see its a squad of NCR troopers
>One of them waves to you
>"Ah V! good to see you, we came here with a message from Major Dhatri"
>He hands you a holotape
>"Your uh deathclaw around?" he asks nervously
>"She's hunting right now, why? You want to see her?"
>He almost visibily shrinks away
>"Uh no, no. She's terrifying"
>You smile
>"Yea she's great isn't she?"
>He shakes his head
>"You're a weird one V but I suppose you have to be a little crazy to tame a deathclaw"
>You shurg and hear Amana's roar in the distance
>"Oh Amana's coming back, wanna stick around and say hi?"
>The color fades from the troopers face
>"N-no..We'll be going now!"
>They run off before you can say anything else
>Not that you mind of course
>People usually steer clear of you anyway



Chapter 2: Now Is Gold

>You wait for Amana as you pump more water calmly
>She was a big girl so you needed plenty of water
>Luckily it goes right into the house and into the boiler to warm it all up
>Amana loved the warm water and now you didn't have to fight her to get her clean
>Up in Oregon she HATED baths, the air was too cold during the winter and when It rained she refused to hunt
>Here you just had to start the water and she would get into the shower
>And usually pull you in too
>Not that you mind of course
>Everyone else saw a murder machine, you saw a playful happy cuddlebug
>But you don't mind that they were wrong, just more time for you and Amana to snuggle
>The tell tale stomping sound of Amana returning from a hunt makes you smile
>"Aaaaammmmaaaanaaaaaa!" you call out playfully
>You wait a moment then hear the response
>"ANNNOOONNNNN!" you hear her roar from the west
>Yep thats your girl
>You see her bound over a hill carrying the body of a Bighorner 
>God damn it always amazes you how strong she is
>She bounds over happily and drops the body of the unfortunate animal beside you
>"Brought food!" she says happily, trying to catch you in a hug
>As much as you loved her, her body and armor are covered in blood
>"Hey hey! Help me hoist this thing up then shower THEN hugs"
>"Ok Anon" she says looking hurt
>"Kisses are ok though"
>You see her eyes light up and she Licks the side of your face happily
>You scratch her head "Missed you, see anything interesting out there?"
>She purrs slightly and moves her head so you can scratch at the base of her horns
>"Metal people over there" she says pointing southward
>Metal people?  Most likely power armor
>Could that be the enclave? or the Brotherhood of steel?
>You know the enclave were the people who made Amana
>You'll store that bit of info for later, last thing you need is some enclave assholes trying to take her from you
>"Ok Amana, lets hoist this thing up then get you in a bath"
>As you tie rope around the legs of the bighorner, Amana grasps the other end of the rope and pulls the animal up with the help of some pulleys
>If you wanna preserve the meat then the blood has to be drained
>Plus the draining blood would often attract those geckos (you learned what they were called from some of the locals)
>Extra food is welcome food
>Although you had a big fence up around the hoist so they couldn't munch at Amana's kill
>She pants slightly as you go to the house door and hold it open for her
>She ducks and walks in with her long muscular legs
>"Alright armor off" 
>You close the door and lock it then walk over to Amana
>Her leather armor was stained black and was hard to make
>It was hard to make because Amana didn't like standing still for too long
>But in the end you made it 
>You gently begin unclasping and undoing straps on her leather
>Granted you don't need to be gentle, you could try to stab her tougher scales with a knife and not even draw blood
>Hell, you recall digging buckshot and other bullets out of her scales
>You pull the final piece of armor off her and toss its aside
>"Ok bath time"
>She leads the way into the bathroom and stands in the shower
>"Warm" she says happily
>You nod and turn on the warm water earning you a gravelly purr 
>"Wwwwaaaaarmmm"
>You begin wiping her off and getting all the blood off her claws and arms
>She crouches under the showerhead and gives a happy purr
>You sneak a few peeks at her gorgeous body and can't help but smile
>Her breasts were bigger than any humans you had seen and her ass was "extra thicc"
>But she was also Much MUCH bigger than anyone out there so it would make sense that she had bigger proportions
>You turn off the water and pull her face to your and kiss her scaley nose
>"Ok how do you wanna get dry?" you ask
>She had several methods for getting dried off
>You could wipe her down with a towel, she could go out back to the large walled off area that you had made or just lay out in the nest you made in the bedroom
>People assumed the area that was walled off in the back was a Pen or something for Amana to sleep at night
>In truth it was just an area she could be outside naked and not have any prying eyes on her
>"Dry outside" she huffs before grabbing you in a hug
>right she wanted hugs before 
>You wrap your arms around her as best you can, her large breasts on either side of your head
>No! Not now boner!
>You feel your feet lift off the ground and you hear her gravelly purr from deep within her chest
>"Love Anon" 
>Before you can say anything you feel her carrying you outside
>"Open" 
>Amana has trouble with doors because of the size of her clawed hands
>She turns you around while still carrying you
>"Open" she repeats 
>You squirm one arm out of her grasp and turn the doorknob
>She pushes the door open with her horned head and ducked through the door into your large walled off backyard
>In one corner was a few mattresses covered in pelts from bighorners and other furred animals
>Amana's spot to sun herself and relax 
>She carries you to and and flops down onto her back onto the cushioned area still, holding you tight
>You hear a long content sigh from her and she sinks into it
>The sun is still rising as you both lay there together
>You recall that NCR trooper giving you a message from whats his face at camp McCarran
>As much as you don't care you should at least humor him
>The NCR were good allies and routinely gave you good work and bounties
>Dealing with problem creatures, hunting down raiders
>You had asked for Bigger bounties but the guy uh .Major Dhatri? yea
>He Said the some guy, a former Boomer had filled most of them
>What the fuck is a boomer anyway?
>Whatever, doesn't matter
>You Pop the Holotape into your Pip-boy and you use  Amana's breast and a headrest to read the message
>It says he needs to talk to you face to face about a job
>Ugh why didn't he just come to you? Why send a trooper with a holotape?
>You frown and roll over so your stomach is on Amanas
>"Amana wanna go to the camp in a bit?" 
>She huffs in annoyance
>"No. People stare"
>You frown
>While you could go alone, you preferred to have her with you
>Nothing more reassuring to your safety than a deathclaw who loves you
>"We can go to that Giant ant nest and get some of those eggs"
>She loves those for some reason, and you weren't above bribing her for a bit of peace of mind
>This catches her attention
>"We get eggs?"
>You scoot up closer to her and kiss her 
>"Yea we can get some eggs and I'll cook them up the way you like"
>This earns you a long lick along the side of your face
>"Ok Anon, dry first"
>You roll back over and relax 
>Amana might be covered in rough scales but her chest and tummy are covered in smoother, softer scales
>Because of that you made the armor that covers those areas thicker and tougher
>Don't want her getting hurt after all
>After about 20 minutes of relaxing you get up and head inside
>"Cuddles?" 
>"We'll cuddle extra when we get back ok?"
>She gives you a big nod and gets up herself
>You hold open the door for her and she stomps in
>"Let's get your armor back on love"
>"No Armor!"
>Oh she was in this kinda mood today
>Lucky you know how to convince her 
>"Ok, but people will stare at you even more"
>She stops to look at you
>"Why stare?"
>You walk to her and attempt to pull her close
>Instead all you get is a face full of boobs
>"Most deathclaws don't have these" you say as you slowly massage her breasts
>She breathes deep, staring at you
>"And I don't want people to stare because these are just for me right?"
>Deep gravelly purrs answer you
>"Ok Armor, just for Anon"
>You smile up at her
>"Thanks love"
>You let her go and go to her leather armor
>She follows and you begin strapping her armor onto her
>Shoulders first, then arms, then her chest and stomach, then her legs and base of her tail
>No helmet yet
>She refused to let you measure her head to try
>Plus those horns of hers got in the way
>You slap her butt to tell her you're done only to get whacked by her tail, which knocks you over
>She gives a raspy laugh at that
>"Let's get going" you say to get as you recover from the slap
>She nods and you open the door for her and let her out into the wastes
>You always marveled at just how graceful she was despite her size, 
>The desert was her element, the forests of oregon were not
>That much was obvious now
>You head north towards the camp with Amana by your side
>The heat and the desert wind blow past as you walk on the sun baked roads
>Roads were such a huge convenience here
>The roads up north had been eaten away but ice and snow and time
>But as you walk you feel Amana tense up
>"Whats up"
>"Smell people" she growls "That way" she point north in front of you
>"Lemme see"
>She stoops down and lets you climb up on her 
>You draw your sniper rifle and look down the scope
>Sure enough there are people, 5 of them, fiends it looks like, definitely not a group of NCR
>"Bad guys?" 
>"Yea bad guys, stay still love, I'll take care of them"
>You aim and hold your breath, steadying your scope
>You still have to compensate for Amana's breathing but you had done this for long enough to know how to deal with it
>You fire off a round and watch as one of the fiends falls
>They Start scrambling around like roaches
>Haha! Fucking fiend assholes! Scatter like the vermin you are
>You continue firing your silenced rifle and watch each of them fall
>Amana isn't the only one able to take down things
>You just prefer to do it from farther away
>"Bad guys taken care of. Coming down"
>You jump off her and into her arms
>She gives you a quick lick to the side of your face before setting you down
>"Lets see what we got over there"
>Unsurprisingly she leads the way because shes so much taller than you
>When you reach the fiends you look around calmly
>Nothing really useful, a few varmint rifles that you don't care about
>"Anything you want here Amana?"
>You see her digging around what looks like their sleeping area
>"Pillow!"
>she turns to you holding a pillow delicately in her claws
>"Ww, put that down, I'll make you a clean nice pillow"
>"Want Fluffy!"
>You nod "I'll make it extra fluffy for you"
>She drops the filthy pillow and bounds over to you to give you a big hug
>You extend your arms and she sweeps you off your feet, hugging you tight
>She really is a cuddle monster
>"Alright alright let's go"
>She lets you and you continue towards the camp
>After about 30 minutes you see the gates and grasp Amana's clawed hands
>"It's ok, they aren't bad"
>You can hear her growling softly
>As you watch the guards shrink back you can't help but smile
>Most of these men haven't seen a deathclaw up close and here was one walking right through the gates
>They open the gates quickly to avoid you, and by extension Amana, having to wait around for them to open
>You walk into the camp calmly with a smirk on your face
>The troops that notice you either stop and stare or run for cover
>A few even yell in surprise
>You keep your hand firmly locked around Amana's
>Where is the major? you want to get in and get out before someone points a gun at -
>"YAAAARRHHHH! DEATHCLAW"
>Too late
>You turn towards the yell to see a shivering trooper with his service rifle raised and pointed at Amana
>"Stay calm it's OK" you whisper to her, holding her hand close
>You can hear her growling growing louder
>"Hey Just put the gun down its ok she's with me!" you shout to the trooper
>He doesn't listen and stands shivering, you can see his finger creeping towards the trigger
>"DO NOT DO THAT KID!" You shout louder
>You see the Major running towards the trooper, shouting something, You can't quite hear it over Amana's Rumbling growls now
>The Major gets to the trooper and is able to point the rifle up towards the sky
>A shot rings out and you jump forward and grab Amana by the horns, forcing her to look at you
>"It's ok! It's ok! It's just me, I got you baby"
>She roars right in your face while charging forwards causing your heels to dig into the ground
>"Shushhhh it's ok" you say hugging her head
>Her charge stops after about 20 feet and she wraps her arms around you
>Her claws are on your back as she hugs you and nuzzles against you
>You finally breathe and sigh in relief, then rub her head softly
>"Good girl, extra snuggles tonight" you whisper to her
>"Sorry Anon" She says quietly as you let go of her horns
>You scratch the area around her horns and then give them a sharp pat
>"I thought you said you can control that Thing" you hear Dhatri's voice over your shoulder
>You turn and frown
>"First off not "It" Dhatri, Amana is a "She", Secondly can you blame her for having a gun pointed at her? I told you she would behave if no one points a gun at her"
>He frowns at you and you hear Amana huff angrily
>"Can she even understand you? I get you say she's smart but I mean-"
>"UNDERSTAND" Amana Roars at him
>"That answer your question?" you say Smugly
>"Uhh yes, anyway I uh have a job for you and your P-" He pauses as Amana growls "Uh Partner"
>She hates being called a pet
>"Ok whats up?" you ask as you rub Amana's side while not even looking at the major
>"Follow me, I'll show you"
>He heads towards the a building to the right of the gates, a part of the camp you hadn't been into
>Never had a reason too
>He leads you into the building as you walk, holding Amana's hand
>"Colonel Hsu, I brought V like you asked" He says walking into a room
>You follow him in and see an Asian man behind a desk
>"Ah so you did Major, I'll take it from here, thank you" he says dismissing Dhatri
>The Major Salutes sharply then leaves
>The colonel stands and extends his hand to you
>"Colonel James Hsu, Nice to finally meet you"
>You Shake his hand
>"People call me V, and this is Amana" you say motioning to Amana
>Surprisingly he extends a hand to her too
>"Hello Amana, nice to meet you"
>She takes his hand gently and shakes it
>"Hello" she grunts
>He looks at you
>"She can talk too? How impressive; you trained her well"
>You frown slightly
>"She's quite smart, but she isn't a pet. And I don't control her like you can a dog. I can only talk to her and ask her to do things"
>He nods quickly
>"Of course of course I didn't mean to offend, but anyway let's get down to business before I accidentally offend you both"
>he reaches into his desk and pulls out a folder of papers
>"We have been having troubles recently some rogue Great khans, a local tribe, we have had a... eventful past with them, but times have gotten a bit better between us"
>You don't know the history of this place nor do you care but they will get
>"Anyway a group of them have been attacking our supply runs occasionally, we can't retaliate against their encampment without raising hostilities between us" He points to a spot on a map where they were
>You frown, their little camp was surprisingly close to your home
>"So you want me and Amana to go in and wipe out these whatevers"
>He nods
>"Unfortunately they have left us little choice and have killed several troopers, so we have to have them taken out, you and Amana are perfect; they can't blame us if a deathclaw kills their people"
>Makes sense actually, they get rid of some annoying tribals and can just say the wasteland killed them
>Plus you get paid
>"Fine, how much will i get paid for taking care of your problem?"
>"600 caps, and i should let you know this is just testing you out, our normal guy is busy"
>Testing? eh whatever you're getting paid
>As much as you enjoyed your solitary lifestyle with Amana, you enjoyed a few comforts that you couldn't make
>A few drinks for you
>A whole bottle for Amana
>And general household stuff
>You stand and turn to leave
>"I'll have it done by the end of the week; make sure none of your troopers try to shoot Amana next time"
>He nods from his seat
>"I'll talk to them, don't die"
>Amana huffs and saunters out of the room 
>Guess she didn't like that comment
>You follow her and open the door to the outside
>Before you let her go outside you peek left and right to make sure no jumpy troopers try to shoot at her
>The bullets wouldn't hurts her badly
>But it would be a pain if she killed someone
>Luckily it was a problem you didn't have to deal with, guess Dhatri warned the troopers because they all steer clear of you
>You walk with a hand on Amana's leg, guiding her with encouraging touches
>Out the gates back into the wastes
>Nothing bothers you for a while until you see the large ants wandering around
>"Ok Amana, lets get you those eggs. Ready Babe?"
>You watch her make a toothy grin
>"Ready!"
>You point in the direction of the ants and she runs off
>But you want in on the action too, so you draw your rifle
>As she runs you aim around her, hitting a few of the Ants and crippling them
>Ha dumb bugs
>You watch as she tears the hapless insects apart through your scope
>At a quick trot you run to her as she finishes the last of the bugs off
>Nice, their legs are pretty tasty
>You gather them up and a few eggs off the larger soldier ants
>But these wouldnt be enough to satisfy Amana
>"Wait here, I'll get more"
>you put away your rifle and grab your pistol
>Ugh this part always sucked
>Carefully you go down one of the holes the ants made
>Amana is too big to fit down here, so you had to fend for yourself
>You follow the tunnel until you find her
>The queen ant
>Too large to move on her own, too swollen with eggs
>But you aren't here to kill her
>You just want the eggs so you can bribe Amana more
>So you gather as many as you can then leave
>"Amaaaaaanaaaa"  guess what I got!" you call out as you leave the ant nest
>"EGGS!" she cries happily, bouncing side to side on her long powerful legs
>Seeing her excited makes you so happy
>"Yep! let's go home and get that armor off you then make these eggs for you"
>But her excitement is too much for waiting for you
>She scoops you up and runs full speed towards you house
>Honestly you can't say you mind as you reach up from her arms and rub her jaw while she runs
>And to think when you first met her, you thought she would eat you
>Instead you have the best mate possible
>With her carrying you the long walk went quickly
>She carefully put you down in front of the house and you opened the door to let her in
>"Come 'ere!"
>How can you not be pumped after that kinda ride?
>Who else in the wasteland could say they got a ride from a deathclaw?
>You quickly undo her armor and let it all fall off her
>She stretches happily once its all removed
>This house had a fridge when you arrived and it still worked (by some miracle)
>You store several of the and eggs away then turn on a burner of the oven
>A bit of water in a pot and you start boiled the eggs and some Ant legs
>That's how Amana liked them; boiled, no spices, just a boiled ant egg
>Not how you would eat it but whatever
>As you prepare the food you hear her behind you shuffling excitedly
>Occasionally she rest her chin on your shoulder with the whisper "Ready yet?"
>You would rub her jaw and kiss her with the whisper "Not yet"
>When the eggs were finally done you gave them to her and she ate them happily while you ate a few of the ant legs you boiled
>Pretty good food out here
>Amana finished eating quickly and let out a large Yawn
>If it wasn't Her, you would be terrified seeing a deathclaw yawn
>So many teeth, so sharp and a large devouring maw
>But when she finished her yawn her tongue was always partially out of her mouth
>That always amused you a bit
>"Bed now" 
>You couldn't argue with her as she started walking to the bedroom and the nest you had made 
>"OK, I owe you cuddles anyway" you say with a yawn, kicking off your clothes
>You follow her to the room, where she lay on her back in the middle of a nest made of skins, furs and fabrics
>Once you're satisfied she's comfortable you climb on top of her, and feel her arms lock around you as you use her large breasts as a pillow
>As you drift off to sleep you can't help but think about how you had the best bed in the wasteland

Chapter 3: How Could This Be Wrong?

>You awake to sunlight streaming through your window
>Windows was a new thing to you and Amana
>The basement you lived in before didn't have windows
>You stretch and rub Amana's sides gently to wake her while listening to her gravely purrs
>As Much as you wanted to stay in bed with her, you had a job to do
>She wraps her arms around you pulling into her chest with a big hug
>"Love Anon"
>You hug her back 
>"Love you too Amana, Ready to hunt some bad guys today?"
>She lets out a long yawn
>"Ready"
>You stand up and stretch then take the time to admire her body
>Rockin tits and ass for sure
>Maybe later you can take advantage of that 
>She would let you for sure, she loves doing all that stuff with you
>But right now you need to get dressed before you pitch a tent
>You pull on your jumpsuit and begin strapping on your light combat armor as Amana stretches 
>"Come 'ere, let’s get your armor on"
>Amana nuzzles against you as you walk through the door to where her armor is
>Such a snuggly deathclaw
>You begin pulling her armor her as she purrs happily
>How she was able to purr you never knew but you didn't care
>As you finish tightening the straps of her armor she leans against you 
>Deathclaw affection is a bit different than human affection 
>Lots of touching and contact because most deathclaws cannot speak
>As such when Amana wasn’t hunting, most of the time she was touching you
>Nothing hindering really
>A tail tap, a clawed hand, leaning against you
>All little bits of affection
>"Food?"
>You nod and go to the fridge
>It worked, barely, but worked
>You grab out a brahmin leg for Amana and a gecko lizard flank for yourself
>"Here you go babe"
>You toss the leg to Amana which she catches in her Jaws and crunches into
>She would even eat the bones, she enjoyed the marrow
>The gecko flank you had was already cooked, so you dig into it
>Mmm cold meat for breakfast
>It’s really not bad to be honest, especially in contrast to the heat outside
>After you both finish eating you go to the front door and check your pip-boy
>The Khans were north near a quarry
>Easy money for you
>Chances are you wouldn't even have to fire a shot, Amana would run off and tear them to pieces before you could
>"Ready?"
>"Ready!"
>You push the door open to the blinding sunlight and sand
>Ah, the warm air is such a stark contrast to your old home
>You hear Amana sniffing the air as she steps outside
>"Anything?" you ask as you look around
>"Smell Bighorner"
>That’s right, the Bighorner Amana caught is ready to be butchered
>Unfortunately no other animals came around to try and get the corpse
>Whatever
>Might as well cut it up so you head inside and grab a large hunting knife
>You and Amana make short work of skinning and cutting up the meat
>Good food for you and Amana for sure, plus more pelts for the nest
>But it’s time to get going
>You walk around your house and begin heading southwest
>Rocky outcroppings push out of the sand like time worn spires, sand and wind has eroded each one
>You're amazed at how pretty the landscape is here
>The walk through the Mojave is quiet and peaceful
>You grip Amana's clawed hand and walk with her
>This is the life
>You have a lovely protective woman with you
>A home near a booming city with food, weapons, medical care and places to give you work
>Although you missed a bit of human interaction
>Granted you were a bit of a loner and you had people to talk to at McCarran
>But they gave you jobs and most people steered clear of you because of Amana
>For now though, you had Amana to talk to 
>You look at your pip-boy map and zoom into the area where the khans made a camp
>Not far from where you are
>You look up and scan the area 
>Nothing so far, even though you know you’re close
>"Smell anything Amana?"
>She stands up tall and sniffs the air
>"People!" she growls while looking towards a large hill with rocks on top
>You're near the quarry, and you're pretty sure they are hiding near the top
>Doesn't look like you’re gonna be able to snipe them, much to your annoyance
>"Let’s get them" you say as you draw out your pistol
>She kneels down and lets you onto her back
>You pat her side
>"Go!"
>She lets out a loud roar and takes of running at full speed
>Up the hill and between 2 large rocks
>The Khans never even got a chance to react
>Amana is on them in a flash
>You jump off her back, pistol drawn and ready
>A Khan is running towards his rifle
>As much fun as it would be to watch him piss Amana off by shooting at her, you would rather avoid having to dig a bullet out of her scales
>Rather than deal with a pissy deathclaw you shoot the khan in the back
>No need for honor, what would that get you anyway?
>Most likely dead, you had seen it before
>Some idiot trying to reason with raiders only to just get shot in the face
>No, that wasn’t going to be you
>You hear crunching and the sound of limbs being pulled away from bodies
>Amana has made short work of the other 3 Khans and has made a mess of their bodies
>sn arm scatters 10 feet away, a leg thrown down the hill
>Doesn't look like you’re going to be able to scavenge anything from those bodies
>Well you might be able to, but you would rather not dig through the gore
>And you were going to need to give Amana another bath
>Not a bad thing at all
>Well while you’re here might as well see if there is anything useful around
>You begin searching and kicking through their stuff
>No way were you using your hands to look for things
>Khans, at least from what you heard, were junkies and you weren't going to get stabbed by a needle
>As you search you her a sharp sniff from Amana and she taps you with her tail
>"Annonnnn"
>You look up at her from your searching
>She's staring out into the quarry
>You follow her gaze and see several deathclaws looking your way
>They can't get to you from down there so you’re safe
>But there are small Deathclaws too, babies from the looks of it
>"What’s up Amana? Do you want to say hi? Can you talk to them or something?"
>She had actually brought home a deathclaw before that she had killed, she made you cook it and eat it with her
>Tasted like chicken
>"Amana want babies"
>This causes you to freeze
>"You want me to get those babies Amana?"
>You look at her and she looks at you
>"No, want babies with Anon!"
>Is that even possible? 
>You had plenty of fun and sex with her but she had yet to lay eggs
>Would she lay eggs? Could she?
>You read that some reptiles need heat to begin to ovulate or something like that
>Maybe the Mojave was just what she needed
>For a moment you imagine yourself and Amana running through the wastes leading a bunch of small deathclaws 
>You look at her and rub the side of her head
>She leans into your hand and purrs, looking deep into your eyes
>"We can try Amana but...I don’t know"
>You see her eyes light up slightly
>"Try!"
>In a deft movement she scoops you in a hug, coating you in blood
>You attempt to wiggle out of the crushing hug
>"Amana! EW! You’re covered in blood! Lemme go"
>She hugs you tighter
>"No!"
>Well you were going to need a shower now
>Amana keeps you locked in her arms for a while
>Her purrs resonated in you as she watches the feral deathclaws interact with their babies
>Would you be able to raise a pack of deathclaw babies?
>Well it would be you and Amana
>Yea, you would try with her
>You knew you would never find a human woman to have kids with
>They never wanted you and you would never give up Amana for them
>Why would you? 
>Well right now you can think of a reason, that being a very bloody hug
>"Amana let me down! We can hug more in the shower ok?"
>She lets out a sad moan and sets you down
>"Thank you, let’s get going home"
>You attempt to wipe the blood off yourself 
>Yea, that’s just spreading it around
>As well, getting this blood off your armor was going to be a bitch and a half
>But you can't be mad at getting affection from Amana
>Bloody gory affection
>So you walk over to the Khan you shot and tear off a piece of his shirt that isn’t soaked in blood
>Wiping yourself down, you walk out between the rocks out of the quarry
>Amana follows you and easily catches up
>She is much taller than you so you aren’t surprised
>You toss aside the bloody rag and walk quietly, no need to talk 
>While you could talk to Amana, she isn't much in terms of talking
>So you both prefer just being with each other
>How could you not?
>She was large, beautiful, and fun to have around 
>Not to mention a great hunter
>As you walk; you look around, scanning the horizon for anyone or anything
>Not that you expected anything
>Most animals are smart enough to know not to attack
>As such you're left to a very peaceful walk
>Before long you are back at your house and taking Amana's armor off her
>She licks your face happily before stomping her way into the bathroom
>You smile and strip your armor as well as your jumpsuit
>That would have to be washed tomorrow
>For now you have a very snuggly lady waiting to get showered

Chapter 4: Mourning Morning

>How many months have you been here in the Mojave? How many times had you tried to mate with Amana?
>Well mating happened but... nothing stuck it seems,
>Sure the heat of the desert threw her into ovulation, and of course you didn’t care about cumming in her whenever the two of you had sex
>But at this point... you knew that either she was barren or you were sterile
>And it absolutely broke your heart to see Amana lay eggs, only for them to not be fertile
>Did vault-Tec somehow render you unable to have children with their experiments? Or did the enclave make Amana unable to lay eggs with life in them?
>You didn't like either option honestly
>She was fertile and you weren't? You were fertile and she wasn't? You both were infertile?
>She could decide you weren't for her and leave you here, alone in the desert to find a new mate
>Or... the worse option
>She wasn't fertile and you were
>You knew in your heart Amana would be a great mother, she took care of you when you got hit with the radiation spikes from your old home
>You could live with her leaving you to have tiny deathclaw babies, really you could
>But of course, you didn't want to
>You wanted her to be fertile and you to be as well
>But all signs pointed to her not being able to have children
>Vault-Tec, for all their misguided experiments, wanted to keep humanity alive to experiment on them
>The enclave didn't need a rogue Anthro deathclaw to have babies...but you wish they did
>You sit at the edge of the nest Amana had made; torn fabric, leathers and hides you both had gathered since your time being here
>It was a literal nest at this point, 3 eggs lay in the center, swaddled by you in fabric carefully, to keep them safe and warm
>But they weren’t fertilized sadly, you could tell at this point by the smell
>Amana kept a sad hopeful optimism, turning the eggs gently in her gentle maw
>It broke your heart to see her tend to those eggs
>How could you fix this?
>Amana always counted on you for solutions to problems
>Sure, she was big, strong, and the most lethal thing in the wasteland, but she still needed you
>Or was it she just wanted you?
>As you sit quietly watching Amana carefully turn the cracking rotten eggs, you knew you had to stop this
>"A... Amana...I can't watch you do this anymore love..." you choke out, looking from her to the rotten eggs she was caring for.
>"Watch?" came Amana low growl at you as you stood you and walked towards her
>You slowly and gently wrap your hands around her massive skull, rubbing the thick scales that surround her horns and face
>"I...I don't think we can have babies" You say sadly, tears forming in your eyes as you speak
>It hit you harder than you thought it would
>You and your mate... unable to procreate because what?
>Some scientist thought it was best otherwise
>You curse the gods of the old world, and hate the gods of this new one; this wasn’t fair!
>You weren’t a raider, you were just a guy with his lovely wife, trying to raise a family
>A heavy weight hits your chest and lap as you rub Amana's head gently
>The weight forces you down into a sitting position as you cradle her head
>An odd wet feeling begins hitting your lap, as you rub the tough scales of the love of your life
>Wetness?
>You look down and see for the first time ever, tears forming in Amana's eyes
>Could deathclaws cry? This was your answer you suppose
>Her head buried in your lap, you hear Amana sobbing for the first time
>"Anon.... Amana wants family with Anon” comes quiet sobs in your lap as you cradle the head of the giant murder machine that was your mate
>You feel your tears fall freely and you cradle her head, petting earnestly, as if they would keep you from crying with her
>"I'm sorry Amana...I’m so so sorry" you say, weeping openly with her
>Her tears wet your pants and shirt as you try to comfort her
>How many raiders had you seen with children? More than enough to see that they were monsters.
>Not monsters like Amana, but monsters in the sense they had no value in life
>They thought everything was theirs and if it wasn't, kill whoever had it and take it
>Amana was fueled by instinct, eat when you're hungry, and sleep when you're tired
>Those monsters just killed for fun
>Did they deserve life over your offspring? The offspring you would never have?
>You would never know at this point as you sat, huddling with Amana crying quietly
>She deserved this....
>You deserved this....
>And still, you were here looking after a few rotten eggs
>As Amana's tears soak your lap you feel something
>An angry fire within you
>Do you just accept this? Just accept that she wouldn’t bear your children!? NO!
>She spoke of armored people to the west
>The only armored people you knew of was the enclave, and you would make them fix her! Or you!
>Did it matter who got fixed?
>You were willing to undergo injections, dissection or whatever for Amana
>Gently, you scratch the thick scales on her neck
>"Come on baby, we can fix this" you say sternly, suppressing your own tears
>"Fix?" 
>Amana's deep gravelly voice came forth as her head stayed buried in your lap
>"We're gonna make the people who made you, fix this" you say sternly, filled now with determination rather than anger
>The enclave could fix her! If anyone could they could! They would have her genome on file or know how to make her fertile or...something....
>She was an FEV reject, something made by someone to do something
>Those metal men could fix this maybe
>The Enclave and all of their brilliant work might be able to fix this
>Could you somehow convince them to "Fix her"?
>How do you make a non-fertile deathclaw fertile again?
>Maybe just to peak their scientific interest?
>You rub her scales softly, remorse coursing through your body
>"Amana, those metal men you saw might be able to fix this" you say sadly, looking at the cluster of eggs
>"Fix?" she rumbles softly again
>"Those metal men could maybe change this, maybe could make your eggs good" you say softly, scratching near the base of her horns
>She wasn’t broken, and neither were you! this was just another thing to overcome
>You guide her to a standing position, continually rubbing her scaled head
>"Yes, fix love, maybe those metal men can help us" you say calmly with a smile
>You pull your armor on and then help Amana put hers on
>"We need to go to them and they can help us" you say as you tighten the various straps on her armor
>Amana looks confused, but doesn’t fuss as you work, staying still until you finish dressing her
>You would rather people not know she was an Anthro, and of course the armor you made for her helped that
>"Do you trust me??" you ask sadly, looking at the rotten eggs Amana laid
>"I trust" Amana gently rumbles
>"Let’s go then" you say with a smile
>Those eggs might be rotten, but they might be good bait for geckos
>A part of you hates that you use those eggs for bait instead of burying them with dignity, but logic reminds you that they were never alive and that you needed food
>Leave them for later, geckos and other animals would be attracted to them
>You hated seeing them tossed aside, but at this point that’s all they were; bait
>Emotional attachment here in the wasteland could get you killed, but they were supposed to be your offspring
>It can’t NOT get to you
>But now you had other things on your mind, the first being get to the enclave Amana found
>After that...wing it 
>"Let’s go Love, we're losing sunlight" you say walking to the front door of your home, leading her gently
>Turning the knob and pushing out, the heat of the Mojave washes over you
>So different from Oregon...
>You slide a hand under Amana's armor and rub gently
>"We can do this baby" you say with a soft sad smile
>Were you saying that to convince her? Or convince yourself? And did it even matter?
>Thoughts for another time maybe and you climb onto Amana's Back and rub the thick scales around her horns
>"Take me to those metal men" 
>"Yes" She rumbles softly before taking off in a run
>The landscape whips past as Amana tears through the desert
>You could walk of course, but you were much slower than she was
>As she runs you take the time to rub her sides gently and talk to her
>"We can do this" "we'll fix this" and other words of encouragement
>The words spur her to go faster, leading you to where she found those men
>After a while she runs to the base of the mountains you always saw, through a valley that was fenced off by a fallen over chain link fence
>You look at your Pip-Boy map and frown
>Hidden valley? What a dumb name
>Amana slows and sniff the air, taking a moment to collect herself
>"Here" she says calmly walking to a bunker door
>Easier than you thought, but not where you expected
>You had run into Enclave hideouts before, usually in a Vault-Tec vault, not in some bunker
>Whatever
>You slide off Amana's back, open the door with the push of a button and walk in
>Amana ducks and follows you in
>"Stay back for a bit, they might not be super friendly seeing a deathclaw" you say, pointing out a corner for her to go to
>It was bad enough you were breaking into an enclave hideout, they last thing you needed is them immediately shooting at you
>"OK Anon" Amana rumbles before heading to her designated corner
>The room isn’t very big, in fact it’s just a 20x20 foot room with the entrance on one side and another door on the other
>You walk to the closed door and push the button to open it
>When it doesn’t open you aren’t surprised at all
>On the wall there is an intercom button, so you push it and speak into it
>"Hello uh, Enclave....people. I need to talk to you, open up please"
>No response
>"Look please open up or I’ll open it up" you say with annoyance in your voice
>Still nothing
>Fine
>You learned to pick lock during your travels and this was no different
>They were going to talk to you whither they liked it or not 
>The door takes a few minutes of you messing with the lock, and you swear a few times as your lock picks break
>A small price to pay
>At last you hear a click and push the button to open the door
>It opens and immediately an armored fist hits you in the chest, sending you sprawling on the floor
>As you try to get up a heavy power-armored foot is placed on your chest, pushing you down
>You look up and see a laser rifle pointed right at your face 
>"Being able to pick that lock means you aren’t a normal raider, what do you want with the brotherhood"
>A man’s voice, digitized slightly by the helmet of the power armor he's wearing
>You struggle to speak as the armored foot pressed the air out of you
>"A-Amana" you choke out
>All the man can say is a quick "Huh?" before Amana rams him full force like a wrecking ball
>Bits of his power armor shatter as he’s slammed into the concrete wall, which cracks as Amana slams him into it and pins him
>You breathe deep a few times and stand up
>"Like I said on the intercom, I just wanna talk" you say walking to the man, half of his helmet has shattered away revealing his face
>He doesn’t even look at you, his exposed eye is locked on Amana as she lets out a beastly roar
>You snap you fingers in his face
>"Hey, I'm talking to you" you say with a smile
>Not that you liked seeing people hurt, but this dude did just sucker punch you
>His eye focuses on you and horror crosses his face
>"You h-have a deathclaw?! How?!" he stammers out
>"I have a deathclaw because reasons; now you said brotherhood, is that what you enclave people call yourself?" you ask as Amana growls at him
>"E-enclave? What? We’re the Brotherhood of Steel! P-please don’t let her eat me!" he gasps out as you pick up his dropped laser rifle and store it away
>Yours now
>But wait a moment, Brotherhood of steel....You had heard of them
>A cult that worships technology from the pre-war
>That explains the power armor
>"Hm, you’re not enclave then, do you know where I can find them?" you ask calmly as you hear his power armor starting to buckle from Amana's crushing grip
>"N-No! Go ask Boomer! He's traveled a lot and he just got back! He’s in the bunker across the valley!" the man wheezes out
>Boomer? Where have you heard that before?"
>"Fine, but first things first..." you say as you pull out your rifle
>"Payback"
>You hit the exposed part of his face with the butt of your gun, knocking him out
>"That's for punching me"
>Amana lets him go and his body crumples
>"Let’s find this Boomer" you say to Amana
>"Amana wanted to hurt man" She says with a tone of disappointment
>"Next time ok love?" you say calmly as you lead her out of the bunker while scratching her scales
>"OK"
>As you walk with Amana, you see a few bark scorpions pop out of the dirt, hoping for an easy meal, only to quickly bury themselves again when they spot Amana
>It doesn’t take long to find the bunker the armored brotherhood man told you about
>You knock on it and wait
>Would you need to pick this lock too?
>That question is answered as the door opens and your staring down the barrel of a gun that looks like it was jury-rigged together
>"Who are you?"
>You look past the barrel and see a man with a helmet on with an opaque visor
>"Boomer?" you ask, raising your hands slowly
>"Yea? Who's asking?" he demands thrusting the gun further into your face
>"Uh People call me V, I would put that gun down if I were you" you say calmly, motioning towards Amana with your head
>He looks at Amana and then focuses the gun on her instead
>"What. The. FUCK!" He says backing into his bunker slowly as Amana growls
>"We aren’t here to fight! We just need to talk to you! That brotherhood guy said to talk to you" you say, moving in front of Amana
>"Wait Ramos pointed you to me? How did you make him talk to you, that guy's head is thicker than a brick" he says, lowering the gun
>"Amana convinced him" you say with a smile
>You peer behind "Boomer" and see an odd looking wolf Anthro behind him, peeking over his shoulder
>An upturned nose? What?
>She puts her head on his shoulder and sniffs a few times
>"OH! They are Mates Anon! I can smell it on them" she says before rushing out from behind him
>"Hey! Gracie Come back here!" he says desperately, trying to grab and stop her
>It was too late, she’s past him and you and is sniffing Amana, walking in a tight circle around her as Amana tries to follow her movements with a confused look on her face
>"She must be an Anthro like me!" "Gracie" chimes out, peeking from behind Amanas thick thighs
>How?
>"How would you know?" you say the wolf Anthro
>"Cuz I can smell you all over her and her all over you! Unless you’re some kinda weird sicko" she says, folding her ears along her skull
>Wait...she has scales, like those weird coyote things...
>You look at Boomer and then back to Gracie, then back to Boomer
>"Uh..." you start, unsure how to begin this conversation
>"Do you know where I can find the Enclave?" you ask
>No need to beat around the bush
>Boomer pulls off his helmet, revealing a missing left eye and scarred face
>You almost recoil back at the sight but keep it together
>"The Enclave? I know of them but don’t know where to find them...Why?" he asks
>You look back to Amana and Gracie, who is now climbing on Amana's tail
>"Amana is an Anthro...But she's infertile" you say sadly
>Gracie stops her climbing and looks at you
>"The Enclave can’t fix that! But the Think-tank can!" She calls to Boomer, who looks...anxious at the thought
>"What’s the Think-tank?" you ask, looking at him questioningly
>"Super scientists in the Big Empty" he answers, rubbing the scars on the left side of his face and His missing left eye
>Super scientists? The Big empty?  What?
>You're totally baffled, and you guess he can see that
>"Look, soon me and a few acquaintances will be going there, it’s too dangerous to go alone"
>You feel a bit insulted, you would be going with a deathclaw!
>Nothing could stand in your way!
>"I can already see you wanna go now" Boomer says with a frown
>"I'll have Amana!" you say, motioning to your deathclaw mate
>"Oh no! That won’t be enough!" Gracie says from on top of Amana's head
>"They have the best tech, the best defenses and giant robot scorpions!" she says with a happy smile, as if that was good news
>"Then what do we-"
>You feel a hand on your shoulder
>"Wait for us to get ready, I’ll call you when the time comes" Boomer says with cold determination in his eye
>You could see the cold calculation on his face
>Whoever "us" was, he knew that numbers had advantage
>You nod slightly, looking up at him and hand him a holotape with your pip-boys contact info
>"Ok"
>He nods and hands you a holotape then motions to Gracie, who slides off Amana and rushes into the bunker behind him
>"We'll be in contact soon" he says calmlyas the door starts to close
>"BYEEE!" Gracie calls out before the doors shuts in front of you
>Did you just make an ally here in the wasteland?
