Chapter 1: Killer Queen
>You are Anon
>Sole vault survivor from Vault 171
>Vault-tec had done some weird experiments with sounds on the people of your vault
>Constant ultra low frequencies drove everyone mad, except you because you wore headphones 90% of the time
>You didn't want to talk to anyone and hated them anyway
>But now you were wondering Oregon, or what used to be Oregon 
>It's winter and a storm was coming in
>You needed shelter bad
>A few click on your Pip boy and you found a location nearby
>A house that had weathered the bombs and time
>You approached the location and found it wasn't a house anymore
>It was just a basement with heavy bomb shelter doors
>You stow your rifle and heave at the heavy doors
>With a grinding screech, they protest being opened after all those years but you needed in
>Snow was starting to fall already
>After pulling for a while, they finally give and you swing one door open
>You walk down the flight of stairs into a concrete room that's about 30 feet by 20 feet
>No carpet, no drywall, nothing
>There was a bare mattress on the floor in the corner with a skeleton on it though
>Gross
>You grab the skele and chuck it outside, then close the door behind you
>There will be no spooks tonight
>You never understood how raiders could chose to live in a place and leave all the goddam skeletons everywhere
>Well you knew some raiders set up the skeletons in weird displays
>You used a laser pistol to start a fire and cook some Radroach meat up
>It wasn't the best tasting food you had ever had but it was food
>Better than 200 year old mac and cheese anyway
>You had piled all the debris around into a corner
>your autism wanted a relatively clean area to stay in
>The Mattress was filthy but soft at least
>You may set this place up as your new base
>Protected, quiet, warm (at least with a fire)
>Yea, you could stay here
>You drift off to sleep thinking about a new home
>You're jarred awake by a screeching noise
>The doors!
>You never put anything in place to lock them
>You hear footsteps
>Big heavy footstep
>You don't want to move much but you peek over to the direction of the door and see it
>A Deathclaw
>A Motherfucking DEATHCLAW
>Reeeeee goes the voice in your head
>Fuck you're dead
>It's gonna eat you and shit out your bones like the skele you chucked outside
>It sniffs the air and then walks over to you
>Its....female?
>Why does it have boobs?
>It's definitely not a normal deathclaw
>But...aren't deathclaws Evolved chameleons?
>Chameleons are cold blooded
>What was it doing out in the snow?
>You stay silent as you feel it stomp up besides you
>Welp, time to die
>But wait
>Instead it wraps is long arms around you 
>You're pulled into its chest 
>Its boobs are on either side of your head
>And you can't move
>You stay still for what seems like years before you hear it
>Snoring?
>It was asleep! You could just maybe
>Do nothing
>You move, it eats you
>You wake it, it eats you
>You're locking into a cuddle with the fucking grim reaper of the wasteland
>You think to your rifle and how it could help you
>Bullshit! It would just make it mad
>Well this is your life now...
>You are being forced to cuddle with a giant lizard
>Still at least you got to see and feel boobs before the end
>You pray to the old gods, the new gods, Buddha, Shiva and Dr.Pepperâ„¢ to let you live through this
>Of course you were terrified! Why Wouldn't you be?
>You had seen a single deathclaw tear through a raider base like it was nothing
>And yet
>This one was holding you close
>Making sure that her claws didn't scratch or hurt you
>She was gentle with you
>You cant help yourself at this point
>You're drifting off to sleep
>You can hear the gentle *thump thump* of her heart beating slowly and rhythmically
>Plus you had a soft pillow too
>Granted a pillow that was attached to a murder machine
>But a pillow nonetheless
>NO! NO SLEEP!
>You try one last attempt to maybe, just maybe squeeze your way out of this
>Gently yet firmly, you grab a hold her hand
>Slowly, oh so slowly you lift the heavy hand and arm
>Oh man Its working!
>You have one arm out from around you
>On to the next
>This one will be trickier 
>It's underneath you
>But you could push it instead of lift it
>Taking special care with giant claws, you push the arm away
>SUCCESS!
>You can get away
>Slowly And careful not to make a sound, you rise from the bed
>You learned to sneak through practice and your pip-boy said you were a pro
>You wanted to believe it right now
>You're away from that problem but now you're faced with so many others
>First, you're still in the basement with the deathclaw
>Second, it was still snowing outside, if you left you died
>Third, the fire was dying, and if it went out you died
>forth, she left the door open, the snow would choke out the fire, therefore you die
>You decide to deal with the easiest problem first
>wooden debris is placed gently onto the fire and you watch as it lights up and the fire jumps back to life
>Now then
>You go to your pack and get your rifle
>Could you kill it?
>You might be able to with a point blank shot to its eye
>you pick it up and Steady your hand and your rifle
>The rifle barrel is close to her closed eye
>but... you pause
>This deathclaw
>This thing... that came through the door and instead of killing you; snuggled you
>Were you going to outright kill it?
>Could you do that?
>Sure you had killed plenty of things
>Animals
>Mutants
>Humans....
>Why was this making you stay your hand?
>Was it because she was the only thing in the wasteland that hadn't tried to kill you instantly?
>You heard a soft whimpering from her
>She balls up into the fetal position, shivering and whimpering in her sleep
>"Fuck me sideways" you mutter as you lower your rifle
>You set your rifle down and pinch the bridge of your nose
>Fuck, what are you doing
>You're in a small cement room with a DEATHCLAW
>But it's a nice deathclaw says a little corner of your brain
>No it's just cold, as soon as it warms up you're breakfast!
>But SHE has been gentle, let's face it she's not like the others
>You shake your head free of dueling consciousnesses and the foo fighters
>You put your face in your hands and rub it
>Ok
>Don't kill it
>You get up and feed more fuel to the fire
>And then make an executive decision
>You get up slowly
>Making sure you leave your rifle propped against a wall
>You go over to the heavy bunker door and grab it to close it
>Straining your muscles, you pull 
>SCRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECCCCCCHHHHHHH  BANG
>You slam it shut
>Turning away from it, you see the Deathclaw
>Her eyes are open and Locked on you
>You walk over to it with your hands up
>Her large yellow eyes look straight into yours
>She's not moving except a few shivers 
>You slowly and cautiously pick up and throw a few pieces of wood onto the fire
>They quickly ignite in the fire and you see some of the shivering subside
>You walk slowly to it, to her
>Hands still up
>It seems to understand
>SHE seems to understand
>You saw her eyes flick to your rifle, still propped against the wall
>Fuck you were trusting a deathclaw
>Please let this work
>She opens her arms again, inviting you back into her snuggle bundle
>You look at her glorious tits 
>*Inhale* *Exhale*
>Back in you go
>She wrap those arms around you again 
>You swear you hear a gentle purring from within her
>Well let's see what tomorrow brings
Chapter 2: Pick Me Up
>You wake up and try to stretch
>You can't? why?
>Oh right
>Deathclaw hugs are tight
>You could hear her snoring still and you sigh
>Well at least you were somewhat comfortable
>Boob pillows weren't exactly what you thought they would feel like but they were pretty nice
>Smooth yet soft scales covered them and felt somewhat cool on the side of your face
>Again you didn't know why she had them to begin with
>You knew Deathclaws weren't a natural mutation
>Jackson Chameleons, Genetically engineered with other animals
>Some forced to Evolve even further with FEV by the enclave
>Could this be another mutation? 
>Duh! Of course it is
>But why is this one alone?
>Deathclaws were pack creatures, you read that from a salvaged Enclave Computer
>You're lost in thought before you feel her stir
>You look up towards her head to see she is looking down at you
>"Uh....hi" you say to her
>You start to try to get up but she holds fast
>She opens her mouth 
>Well fuck
>You close your eyes and await the end
>Instead, you feel a long wet tongue run up the side of your face
>It's also sticky
>After a few seconds, you open your eyes and look back at her
>you had never seen a deathclaw up close, not alive anyway
>Long horns curled out of her head similar to a rams horns
>Large yellow eyes
>Big teeth that were always showing 
>But you could swear she was smiling at you
>You get another lick on the side of your face
>A quick shake of your head to try and get a bit of the deathclaw drool off you
>"Can i get up?" You ask it as you try to wiggle away from her grasp
>You hear a kinda sad "hrrrrrmmmm" from her
>Can she understand you?
>The computer did mention "smart" Deathclaws
>It said most were only comparable to a child but some were on par with adults
>And although they cant talk, they can parrot speech sometimes
>She opens her arms and lets you slide away from her
>She takes the opportunity to sit up on her digitigrade legs
>"Can you understand me?" you ask as gather up some more pieces of wood from around the cellar
>"Understand" she says in a deep, gruff but distinctly feminine voice
>holy shit
>"Uhm... I'm Anon" you say placing a hand on your chest
>"Anon" she parrots back
>"OK uh, you don't have a name probably, can I call you uhm" 
>You think to your nerd roots
>"Amana?
>"Amana" she says back
>you guess that's a yes
>You click your pip boy to your inventory
>You were hungry and she might be too
>Radroach again? No 
>Salisbury steak? gross also its 200 years old
>Yao Guai? Eh, why not
>You pull out a leg of Yao Guai meat and throw them over the fire
>Also 2 more, just to set them next to Amana
>"Here" you say as you set them down
>She looks at them then at you
>Using her long clawed hands, she then picks up one and bites into it
>You hear sickly crunches as she eats the leg
>Bone and all
>You notice her long tail sliding side to side on the floor as she eats
>Studying her closer shes a Light grey color on her stomach, neck thighs 
>The rest of her arms head and calves are covered in tough looking dark grey scales
>Her hands and feet are as well
>You try your best to avoid looking at her slit 
>You did take a peek now and then though
>It looked similar to what a humans looks like
>You think so anyway, you weren't exactly a casanova
>In the vault, you were largely ignored
>Out of the vault, everyone tried to kill you
>The few traders and settlements you came across weren't exactly willing to show you a good time
>But here you were with a deathclaw, enjoying a meal
>And Best of all, the meal wasn't you!
>You pull your Cooked yao guai off the fire and dig in
>Amana is already on her second leg of it
>You ate together in peace with her before finishing and deciding to look outside and relieve yourself
>Not like you were gonna do it in here with her
>She eyes you with interest as you stand and walk to the door
>You hear a soft whimper from her as you push the door slightly
>"It's ok Amana, I'm just gonna check for a second" you say as you pull out your Laser Pistol
>You push it open and look around
>a good 2 and a half feet of snow had fallen overnight
>Well at least you would have a source of clean water for a bit
>You shuffle over to a spot and release the beast
>as you relieve yourself, you let out a content sigh 
>After all, you had been holding it for a while
>Honestly you were surprised that you didn't piss yourself when Amana came into the Cellar
>You are about to shuffle back in when you see it
>A Full grown yao guai
>Goddammit! It must have smelled the Meat you gave Amana
>And Unfortunately it sees you and instantly Charges
>"AMANAAA!" You cry as you shuffle to the door
>It's behind you, you can hear it and almost feel it breathing down your neck
>you shoot your laser pistol over your shoulder a few times
>Did you score a hit? You weren't gonna check
>Then suddenly you see a blur appear out of the cellar and streak past you
>The yao guai is screaming something in its ancient bear language
>You look back and see Amana sinking her long claws into its hide and ripping it apart
>Holy fuck, you actually had a deathclaw protecting you
>And HOLY FUCK WAS IT SCARY
>That yao guai stood a snowball's chance in hell
>There she was, covered in its blood 
>Ok you had food for a while but Amana was curling up
>Oh no was she hurt?
"Why do you care?" says the devil on your shoulder "it's a deathclaw"
>"SHE saved me from that yao guai" you think back at it
>"And what? You drag a eight foot tall Demon into a basement and live happily ever after?
>"Yes"
>She's freezing from the  -7 degree weather out here and shutting down 
>You run to Amana as fast as you can, hampered the whole way by the snow
>Grabbing her you pull with all your might
>"COMEON AMANA DONT YOU FUCKING DIE NOW!" You scream at her
>She half lumbers, half leans on you as you pull her
>You manage to get her into the basement again and begin warming her up
>She's as close to the fire as you can get her and you Grab every wooden thing around, every thing that would burn and dump it into the fire
>That includes the mattress 
>Goodbye comfy sleep
>You take off the wet outer layer of your clothes and climb onto her
>You were going to save the only thing in the wasteland that had ever cared about you 
>Somehow
>you try your hardest to wrap your arms around her and give her your body heat
>Even if you couldn't quite get your arms around her you were going to try
>You pull yourself as close to her as possible
>Her breathing is slow but steady
>Rubbing your hands up and down her muscular body to create friction heat
>You feel the smooth scales on her stomach 
>Her rough scales on her arms and neck
>The squishiness of her...
>wait squishy?
>You realize your hand is on one of her enormous breasts
>Embarrassed, you pull it away quickly 
>you can hear Amanas heart beating faster now
>her breathing is also faster
>You stay on her holding her for a while
>You actually drift back to sleep again
Chapter 3: A Rush of Blood to the Head
>You awake with a start to Amana purring gently and ...petting you?
>She's on her back With you laying on her stomach and chest
>You yawn and rub your eyes
>"Hey Amana, thanks for the rescue" you say looking into her big yellow eyes
>"Thanks" she parrots back rubbing your back quickly
>She's being very careful with her claws around you
>"Why don't I go get that yao guai you killed and get us some food?" You ask her
>"Ok" 
>You're surprised at how quickly she learns words
>Gently you get up off her
>She pets your head as you stand up
>Grabbing your rifle, you look for your outer layer of light armor
>There they are, over by the fire where you left them to dry 
>You put on them on and heave the door back open
>It's stopped snowing at least
>The body of the slain Yao Guai is about 30 feet away, in the middle of a partially melted Bloody snow bank
>Aiming down the scope of you rifle , you look left and right, scanning for anything
>You weren't going to get caught with your pants down again
>Literally or figuratively
>You peek over your shoulder and see Amana looking out and hear her whimper softly
>"I got this" 
>You trek out towards the body and stop at it
>Again you peer down your scope
>Nothing but snow
>You Sling your rifle and grab the yao guai by its hind legs and drag it to the basement
>Dam this thing is heavy
>Occasionally you stop and push snow out of the way
>After 20 minutes of pulling and clearing snow you make it to the Stairs and kick it down them
>"Fuck that's heavy" you say as you walk in and close the door
>Amana sniffs it and recoils away
>it was frozen after all
>leaving it at the foot of the stairs to thaw out, you go back over to the fire
>You were going to need more wood for it soon
>And a new mattress
>Or some kind of bed 
>You sigh and look through your pip boy inventory
>The world is covered in Super future Storage units that make a Tardis look small and your little basement doesn't have one
>You decide to take off your armor and almost as soon as you do Amana has picked you up and is cuddling you
>Ok.. 
>So you have a very very cuddly Deathclaw
>Nothing weird about that right?
>She was very attracted to you and protective of you 
>It hasn't even been a day and shes all over you now
>Maybe she lost her pack and is lonely?
>You didn't know for sure
>But now she was sitting on the floor with you in her lap
>She hasn't once stopped rubbing those giant scary hands on you
>You hope it's just for warmth
>But you have a pair of giant tits on your head
>Smooth soft squishy scaled tits
>But hey boobs are boobs!
>NO BONER BAD BOY SHOO!
>You shake your head free of those thought 
>Amana is sniffing you very intensely now though
>Shes sniffing your hair and your chest
>She suddenly picks you up and turns you around and is sniffing deep into your crotch
>You struggle away and fall onto your ass painfully
>Wait a second
>Do lizards go into heat?
>You don't think so but she was a mix of animals 
>She buries her head deep between your legs and sniff deep while nuzzling against you hard
>So hard in fact you're pushed up against a wall
>"WHOA WHOA WHOA AMANA!" 
>You grab her horns and attempt to pull her head away only to get a large clawed hand pin you to the wall 
>Oh god 
>You can feel her hot breath and....wetness?
>She's drooling and lapping at your erection through your pants
>You struggle in vain to get her away but you would have better luck moving a dump truck
>You can feel and hear her Purring against you send wet vibrations to your groin 
>Now you were faced with a totally different struggle
>Her constant motion, combined with the licking and wetness is pushing you to the brink
>You're faced with a dilemma 
>Cream your pants and possibly get her even more riled up from the smell
>Or attempt to get your pants down far enough and Squirt it onto onto her
>You don't have much time to think
>You grab your waist band and pull down just in time to release onto her face
>She's stopped now, leaving you panting and with little control over your spasming legs
>She pulls her hand away from your Crotch slowly
>You look at her to see shes licking your cum off her face with her long tongue
>Her yellow eyes blaze and she's back sniffing and licking
>However this time your erection is exposed
>Her long tongue wraps around your cock and slithers on it, sending shivers up your spine
>"Fuck Amana Wait please" You say as you struggle in vain
>You don't even have the muscle coordination to walk let alone fight her off
>Her breathing is getting rapid and her tongue is coiling around you. quickly pumping up and down 
>You're forced to cum again 
>This time it's directly into her mouth
>She keeps going though, ignoring your pleas for her to stop
>You pass out after the 7th time you get off
>You awake to licking on the side of your face
>You're being held tight by Amana
>She's on her back and holding you against her chest and stomach 
>She's licking you and purring
>You feel drained, both literally and figuratively
>How long did she keep going after you passed out?
>Either way she seems VERY Satisfied with either you or herself
>Or both
>You wiggle your way off her and stand up
>"What the FUCK!" you yell at her
>"What Was THAT Amana?!
>She shrinks back and cowers from you and whimpers softly
>Maybe you were too harsh with that bit
>You had just received the best blowjob of your life
>Even if it wasn't consensual
>And the only blowjob you'd ever gotten
>You pet her head gently and sigh
>"Sorry it's just that you surprised me...and didn't listen" you say as you rub the rough scales on her face
>"Lets not do that again alright, Or at least give me a warning or something so I can get my pants off" you say
>Your pants are still drenched from her drool
>"Ok Anon" 
>You wipe them off a bit with your hands then think about what you were doing prior to being sucked dry
>Right the Yao guai
>It's thawed out, so you open your pip-boy and select a knife to skin it and get the meat from it
>Amana watches as you clean and skin the mutated bear
>Hm, now you had a sort of replacement mattress once you stretched and dried the fur
>You should hunt more to build a bed here
>Or would it be a nest with Amana there?
>Whatever
>You finish cleaning it after and hour or so
>What you really needed was a workbench in here
>Thing to do #1 when the snow melts
>You give Amana a leg and cook yourself some of the fresh meat over the fire
>the Skin Still needed to be stretched though 
>But you needed wood though
>You click your pip-boy open and select an Ax
>Then you don your now dry and warmed armor
>There were trees nearby that you could use for firewood and for building materials
>You grab your rifle and go to the door
>You feel big clawed fingers wrap around your waist
>Amana picks you up in a big hug whimpering and rocking you side to side
>"Heyy heyyyyyy" you say rubbing her head
>"I'm not going long, just grabbing firewood and stuff to get the yao guai skin good for sleeping on ok?" 
>You rub her horns gently
>"Ok" 
>She sets you down and you push open the door
>You raise your rifle as you walk up the stairs and aim through the scope
>Daring anything to pop up 
>You scan left and right before lowering your rifle
>"Let me know if you see anything" you call to Amana
>She has her head level with the snow, still in the basement
>Stowing your rifle and pulling out the ax you go to town on the nearest tree
>After about 30 minutes of swinging you get what your pip boy calls "30 wood"
>Well that's neat
>You head back to the basement and take off the armor 
>Amana pulls you into a hug
>"Hey quit it! Hey I gotta work"
>You wiggle out of her arms to short whimpers
>As much as you liked the affection you had work to do
>You build wooden square that's about 8x8 feet then use wires you had stored to stretch out the skin
>Light shined through where Amana shoved her claws through it
>you set the rig into the corner and get to throwing the rest of the remains of the yao guai outside
>it would need a day or 2 to dry and be usable 
Chapter 4: Don't Panic
>you were hunting
>You need more food and more furs
>It took a while to convince Amana to stay in the basement and not follow you
>You had literally chased her back into it at one point
>you threw snowballs at her to convince her to stay
>She couldn't take the cold like you and there was still plenty of snow
>Radstag tracks through the snow would lead you to your prey
>You knew you could make a decent bed/nest with Radstag pelts
>When you finally for the Yao Guai Pelt ready you tried placing it a few places
>Amana didn't like anywhere other than a corner furthest from the door
>But that wasn't on your mind right now
>You aim down your scope and see 3 radstags
>A buck and 2 females
>Your rifle was silenced, you used it usually to pick of raiders from far away
>3 silent shots
>3 dead radstags
>You walked over to the bodies and started collecting the hides and meat
>Somehow you could carry like 300 lbs of things
>You assume the pip-boy is infused with some devil magic since everything you pick up disappears until you click it In the inventory screen
>Whatever, you would take devil magic over physical labor
>You stand after finishing and spot something in the distance
>Looks like an abandoned Neighborhood
>You knew there could be ghouls hiding or raiders trying to ambush
>But with the snow ghouls would probably be frozen...
>You ventured in using your sneak skills
>No need to upset anything
>Then you spot the thing to make your life so much easier
>A workbench 
>You "pick it up" and it disappears into your inventory
>Fucking devil magic
>You scavenge a bit but don't find much of interest, 
>Aluminum, turpentine, adhesives etc. Useful things but not as good as the workbench
>After that,you trek back to the basement, following your footsteps
>After about an hour of walking, you see the basement and Something that stops your heart
>Blood in the snow
>You race to the door only to find Amana joyously munching on what appears to be brahmin 
>You peek out the door and see that the poor creature must've wandered to close and she sprung out like a 8 foot trapdoor spider
>The thought of an 8 foot spider makes you shudder
>Hopefully there weren't any giant mutated spider
>Well then, you had the workbench which you assume was also imbued with devil magic
>You had run across another vault dweller from vault 666 (you doubted there was that many vaults and that vault-tec was fucking with people)
>He used a workbench to build a town up in like an hour
>You saw him walking around twitching and then a wall would appear and start to rotate into a position that he liked
>You were confused about how it worked but he said it had something to do with the pip boy 
>But you got to work in your little shelter 
>Amana watched as you created a pile of pelts for you both to sleep on
>Created a fire/cooking station
>You even went outside and was able to "disassemble" the snow within a certain area
>DEVIL MAGIC!
>But you were happier knowing you had a comfy place to sleep and relax
>The day was drawing to and end now though
>You stripped your Armor and weapons and set them on the display you created
>the door was closed and the fire (conveniently close to the bed) was stoked
>Now it was just time to relax and snuggle Amana
Chapter 5: Sawdust
>It had been about 3 weeks since you had been...accosted By Amana
>She's very snuggly and friendly towards you
>Only you
>A group of raiders had followed you at one point
>They snuck into the basement to get your things and were met by a VERY mad Amana
>They interrupted her snuggle session with you
>She tore one of them in half
>Still you were able to use your devil magic, uh your workbench to turn their clothes into cloth
>your Nest / bed was completed
>It looked similar to a birds nest made out of leather, hides, and cloth
>Amana was able to go outside more now because the snow had melted
>It didn't seem like hunting with her there
>You would be looking around or following tracks when she would simply rush off
>About 10 minutes later she would reappear dragging a body of a radstag or a brahmin 
>You weren't complaining though
>Easy meals and more materials for whatever
>Luckily Amana hadn't had an urge for you either
>You had been tempted a few times to let her
>But ultimately you decided against that
>Don't want to make a habit of letting her get to you
>Right now you were being nuzzled by Amana as you cooked
>She was rubbing her nose and muzzle against your back as you made some squirrel stew
>Squirrel is actually surprisingly tasty
>Their meat tastes a bit like pinecones
>She enjoyed your stew even if she drank the whole pot after you got your share
>"Hey there Amana, calm down food is almost done" you say as she whimpers slightly
>You had learned what each different grunt and whimper meant during your time together
>Right now, she was hungry
>You finished preparing the stew and settled into the nest with her
>It had to cool for a bit before it could be eaten
>She was licking and rubbing you as per usual
>You had gotten used to the deathclaw drool all over you at this point
>She apparently licked to "clean" and taste you
