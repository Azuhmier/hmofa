
>Finally moved in, everything is exactly where I want it
>My mom's 'boyfriend' giving this house to me was awesome
>Just a regular rent payment i could easily cover with my job being literally 10 minutes away
>Everything planned and scheduled, I should be able to save up enough and go on my trip in 2 years.
>But doesn't life just love throwing wrenches into plans and schedules?
>In this case...the HOA, Home Owners Association
>More particularly, the president of the neighborhood
>At first, a major annoyance, but tolerable if avoided
>But soon enough, strange things stacked up and her nosy nature turned from annoying to creepy
>But first to describe the President
>In a word, Assault, an assault on my senses and sensibilities
>Coyotes were normally smaller, fluff making them look stocky almost, with big pointed ears above it all
>She was much taller than any coyote I had ever seen, and in platform heels she met the eye of all but the tallest men.
>A shade darker brown than most as well
>Now imagine if the 80's vomited and molded a coyote out of the junk
>EVERYTHING about this woman, BIG, LOUD AND OBNOXIOUS
>She would have been the height of fashion because every time I saw her, a different outfit of clashing, eye bleeding neons. Her hair which was a bizarre silver blonde and might have looked...passable, instead was permed or done up in some hideous hairspray and scrunches.
>I don't think I ever saw her in shoes that didn't show off her toes, always painted the exact same seafoam teal-green, matching her claws and on every toe, a gold ring, sometimes with a gem, sometimes not, on her fingers however, she wore one signet ring, with a strange symbol on it. 
>And I could only wonder what elder being she worshiped that allowed her to have such massive perky breasts and have them fit inside tight spandex and unitards!
>her clothing almost always pushed up the fur around her neck, giving her the plush collar look, revealing under the darker brown fur was light cream, like a chocolate coated ice cream
>Even how she talked! "SUGAH! SWEETIE! Oh Babe!" In the same valley girl crossed with Fran Drescher that made my ears weep
>As if to complete the look, she drove a Barbie pink convertible
>The thought alone of touching it made my skin crawl
>Needless when I first saw her, I put her on my instant "NEVER to be allowed entry into my life" list.
>But that doesn't mean she didn't TRY and nose her way in.
>"Wellness check" when it was too hot or snowed too much
>The occasional pie or "leftovers"
>And ALWAYS invites down to the huge block parties with all the other neighbors
>It became a cold war of sorts between her and myself, as she desperately tried to size me up and get any bit of juicy information about me or what I did for a living, or even what my house looked like
>I would retaliate...by being slightly more rude, and dressing slightly more homeless, stained shirts and greasy hair
>Eventually she surrendered...or put our battle on hold
>I think she was afraid I would walk out in just tighty-white underwear one day
>But I wasn't stupid, I knew exactly what her game was
>Deception, information and extraction of anything she deemed "unfit" for her neighborhood.
>I had seen several neighbors who had...less than stellar reputations suddenly move, or get bought out by more powerful people
>And I was perhaps the poorest guy on the block! Senators and government, judges and lawyers! 
>However, as the months passed, I noticed very quickly, there was much more to miss "hairspray executive" than meets the eye.
>Most obvious were her two goons. "Nephews" she said "from my father's side, it's a LONG story dahling!"
>Hardly. These two dum-dums were definitely muscle.
>They knew how to keep a background presence, almost invisible at times. But they were ALWAYS there.
>Pinstripes and black suits over their spotted coats and thick necks. Hyenas. One I called Glare, he didn't seem to like anybody. The other was Sleepy, always half-lidded look of mild surprise, like someone woke him up and told him his hated mother had finally died.
>I tried talking to one once, Sleepy since he seemed more personable.
>I was wrong. And earned a solid 6 minutes of staring before I simply surrendered and left to the safety of my house
>Thick long necks hunched in analyzing everything and everyone, hands clasped behind their backs, no doubt where they had their guns hidden under their suit jackets.
>And every so often on particular nights, she and her goon patrol would leave, get into an incredibly long Lincoln limo and drive away.
>The particular limo kids started rumors about, claiming it never moved, but it did. Whenever no one was supposed to see.
>And God help anyone who so much as scratched the paint.

>So when a persistent knock came on my door, I wasn't expecting much.
>I ordered some things from Amazon, and had to be awake, goddamn mail assholes just leaving.
>However what greeted me as I looked through the peephole was a mouthful of fangs and electric green-yellow eyes behind her Callie Briggs style glasses.
>Wonderful.
>I unlocked and opened the door as much as the chain would allow. "Angie.."
>"OH MAX DAHLING! You are awake, oh good! I've been meaning to talk to you, can I come in?"
>"...what did you want Angela?"
>She exaggerated a pout for my one eye swiveling at her before shoving a notice in my face
>PAST DUE in big red letters
>Oh Joy, my protection money has come due.
>"Your payments have been a little late sweetie~"
>I really hope she picked up on my distain through my one eye staring her down
>"So you've come to bully me? A note on my door would have sufficed...Angela."
>Suddenly she pressed herself against the door and "Actually Maxwell, it really would not have"
>CUE THE PISS! The tone alone made me stumble backwards, it was like she was suddenly someone completely different!
>And stumble backwards, right into the waiting arms of Glare, who grabbed my wrists behind my back and a squeeze to my throat as I tried to yell
>Sleepy was next to the door, obediently unlocking it and letting their boss in
>In my panic I noticed the sliding glass door was open...on the second floor. Well that explains how Tweedledee and dum got in...and a check of their feet told me how they got the drop on me.
>Neither wore shoes.
>Angela the coyote strolled into my house like she owned the place already, looking all around as Sleepy shut the door behind them and locked it.
>"Wow Max, I'm actually impressed, no drugs or dirt...but art deco? Wow, it all flows so well"
>Well I had been planning my own house for years, so it should, you bitch. Plush art deco furniture and sharp lines ran around every appliance and chair, save maybe the TV and my computer.
>Can't skimp on those!
>And so what if I did have a style, it was at least more fashionable than the garbage she wore!
>Of course I didn't say this... because I couldn't. Claws pricking my throat prevented this.
>She must have seen me turning blue and snapped at Glare
>"Xin, release" xin? Sin? Who cares?! Sweet Sweet oxygen!
>After my coughing and squirming, I met the floor. A foot on my spine told me not to move.
>"So you two do have names, you could have corrected me at least" was my first thought, hey, if they were going to kill me, I was going to get my snark in!
>Sleepy giggled, Sin just pressed his foot in harder, making my back pop
>"Oh! Thank you so much, that's been killing me for awhile"
>Angela returned from inspecting the kitchen and raised an eyebrow "you're a calm fella for someone who's home was just broken into"
>Still scaring hearing that voice come out of that body, ice cold with a bit of Russian twinge in it to give her a weird baseline growl almost
>"Well Angela, how I see it, if I yell, you kill me, if I run, you kill me, if you wanted me dead, you'd kill me. I'm a practical sort of fellow."
>She tilted her head, ear twitching before...she laughed? And not that annoying disgusting laughter either, this was musical, deep. If it wasn't for my predicament, I would have been proud of myself. That was the laugh of a woman who didn't laugh much.
>"You're so surprising Maxwell! I had you pegged so wrong! Bala!" She turned to Sleepy, er Bala now. "Upstairs, anything of note" 
>Bala started upstairs before Angela looked back at me and then back to her goon "And Bala?" The goon paused "be gentle".
>Bala nodded and disappeared into my upper rooms
>Suddenly I was on my feet again, my shoulders ached more than torture
>"No. Funny. Business." Came the dark hiss behind me.
>I wasn't even ashamed of the shudder that traveled up and down my spine from that rumble
>"You're a..."
>The toothy grin I saw as I turned my head answered my question.
>Bala and Sin, both goons, probably both girls. Why had this thought never occurred to me? Hyenas? Had to be the suits.
>Bala came back downstairs with a shrug and head shake.
>Angela seemed pleased "Good! Now, down" she pointed
>To the unfinished basement.
>Well...was unfinished.
>"Maxwell, the real reason I'm here, not for late payments, you've always been a good boy on those, but a suspicious HOT room down here, my associates had a worry you might be doing something...less than reputable down here and we can't have anything lower the property value, you see, or scare away potential high-end buyers"
>Dropping the pretense now huh? "So you have my house monitored.."
>Angela chuckled "silly boy, we monitor all our clients, you are a special case considering your landlord just let you move in without telling me! I didn't even have time to bug the place!"
>Finally we reached The door. My door.
>A brand new, titanium allow door with special sealant to keep all heat in.
>"Open it."
>I sighed, slowly pulling out my keys and unlocking the door.
>Sin grabbed my arm and pulled me away, Bala opened the door, gun magically appearing. 
>I could have cried. "So, there it is... you've discovered my horrible secret...I like to garden"
>Inside the hot box was a large room, full of UV lights and automatic misters, some in their own separate box with temperature controls. I struggled to keep from dying, first from laughing, then from the bullet that would undoubtedly go through my head seconds after.
>Angela and even the goons seemed stunned. "No drugs...no meth...I..just gardening? Not even weed?"
>"I would hope no weeds!" My joke earned me a death glare...from Sin.
>Angela seemed disappointed, or just so shocked it wasn't sinking in.
>"So the mob shows...for a few plants? That's embarrassing."
>Angela tutted and shook her finger at me "not the Mob dear, a Family."
>I had a small window of opportunity..."so what were you planning on doing? Killing me and burning my shit?"
>Angela looked again and snorted "what? No dear Maxwell, we would blackmail you until you gave in, then kill you and move all your things across country" she said it so matter of fact.
>"But... you don't have anything to blackmail me with!" I hoped.
>"Hmm, no, no we really don't!" She shook her head, curls bouncing around her.
>Bala moved first, shoving her gun straight up my nose
>"But know this...don't cross my family, or we will make something work" Angela's ice queen voice chimed in, maybe Bala and her gun made it more convincing.
>Meanwhile, I, pressed against the door, was pissing myself.
>So I decided now might be a good time. I twisted my shoulders and back, hooking my t-shirt on a particular light switch....flick.
>In a moment, the door started closing, the flood lamps above us struck and the misters turned on full blast.
>The effect was something like a flash bang.
>Just enough distraction for me to slip out the door as it sealed shut. For 30 seconds.
>I'm sure even through the banging and yelling they were doing, they could hear me howling with laughter all the way up the stairs.
>I made it to my car at least, doing my best to get away in a shitty hunydai from the 2000s
>As I checked my mirror, I saw them pour out of the house, soaking. Angela was...less than pleased
>As I got down the street, I saw her taking off those ridiculous platforms..no.
>The Terminator would be proud as Angela sprinted after the car
>INCONCEIVABLE! 
>Olympic sprinters would be panting at this point!
>My brain screams, I stop out of pure horror and reflex.
>Suddenly Angela is gone. It takes a few moments to catch up that she had grabbed the back spoiler of the car, cartwheeled up my roof and in through the open window.
>And now there was another gun in my face.
>"Turn around." I suddenly missed my annoying 80s vomit HOA president.
>As carefully as I could, I went home, pulled into the driveway...and earned a nice nap and a sharp headache for my actions.
>I awoke tied to a chair in my living room, thankfully not naked, but surrounded by three, very VERY upset ladies.
>All of whom had guns.
>Angela sat in a chair while the others stood, large pistols ready should I move again.
>"Any more surprises Maxwell?"
>The gag in my mouth let me shake my head slowly
>Angela's scowl froze the blood in my veins but suddenly it seemed she had a new idea, grinning
>"Maxwell... how long have you suspected my deception? When did you first find out? I know you're not a spy, or a government agent, we have tabs on them...so who are you?"
>Snapping her fingers Sin yanked the gag from my mouth
>And so...I told her honestly.
 "Fuck you firstly"
>Bala and her pistol punished me for that.
>Once I recovered from the blow, I told her.
>I suspected her and her twin shadows from the beginning.
>And listed all my observations.
>Angela listened and smirked after I finished
>"You're good at lying...and finding out you're being lied too. Useful skills to have...but dont ever lie to me again, no games or tricks."
>She leaned back in in her seat and crossed her legs
>"So...you have a choice Maxwell darling" something told me it wouldn't be much of a choice
>"You and Sin and Bala can take a long trip into the country, and have your own party, which you wouldn't be coming back from"
>Sin and Bala smiles cut 10 years from my life, something tells me their particular party wouldn't be fun for me.
>"OR!" A teal finger claw slid under my chin and tenderly scratched my scruffy face
>"My Family is organizing a very important Party, VERY important and impossible to miss...I can bring a plus-one, I don't have a dinner date and humans are all the rage right now...I'm sure if we cleaned you up, you might even make me look better by comparison"
>Nope, no choices, only death.
>There will be no living, or happy parting, just death. Death now, or death later.
>Finally I managed to swallow my piss and smiled "why, of course, I would love to join your little...Family party.."
>A few more days of sweet, sweet life.
>Angela smirked and pulled out...my phone?!
>"My number is already in there, do check your messages often dear"
>I nodded.
>Suddenly all three of them moved at once, putting away their guns and moving out the door
>"Now, I'm sorry but I just Gotta like,  go shower! I'm so soaking right now dahling! Tah Tah Maxie!"
>And the annoying neighbor was back. My door closed. And...I was still tied to the chair.
"HEY! HEEYY!"
>Nope, long gone
>After awhile I managed to rock the chair over to wiggle myself free, rubbing my wrists as I uncurled on my carpet
>Maybe if I just lay here and die, I won't have to die horribly at the hands of the mafia?
>A paper crinkling caught my attention.
>Stuck to my back was a notesheet.
>"Clever Boy! <3<3<3" and under each heart was a different shade of lipstick.
>Lipstick...my brain replayed the last moments when I wasn't groggy from headwounds.
>Angela's typical neon green, but...not...Bala and Sin's lips were wiped clean, but a hint of color lingered. I remember thinking it was blood or something.
>My fear boner finally reared its swollen head.
>I can't tell you how long I laughed, only that I passed out and woke up much later
>A loud emergency message tone blared from my phone
>Auntie Angel: "limo, 15 minutes, don't be late"
>Angel? Poor cover name? 
>15 minutes?! I couldn't shave and shower in 15! 
>I did my best to smell presentable and got mildly dressed...in jeans and loose button shirt
>Sandals would have to do.
>I rushed outside...the limo was still parked where it always was.
>Walking down, I couldn't help but picture how many ways this could go wrong.
>So naturally I tap on the impossibly tinted windows, which had to be illegal to have that dark.
>The window cracked and plume of cigar smoke escaped
>I barely saw an eye before the window rolled back up and the door opened with a paw to yank me inside
>While I was on the floor, shag floor by the way, Ice cold Angel told the driver, whoever it was, to go.
>The car lurched and the window rolled back up
>I finally managed to sit on my ass not my face and look at Angel.
>And for the third or fourth time that day, my heart stopped, this time however it was because all the blood rushed to my dick.
>Sprawled across the seat was a woman, not some 80s vomit comet creation but a stone cold woman.
>I recognized her instantly but my brain refused to accept it. Only racists claim all species looked alike.
>Her usual nightmare perm was gone, replaced with long flowing locks of silver blonde that curled around her shoulder and neckline of fluff.
>Her fur was fluffed and groomed to perfection and what could only be described as a blood-colored pinstripe suit covered her, including a skirt and red pantyhose that covered her legs
>Trailing down, I noted she wasn't wearing her toerings...but her signet ring gleamed in the dim light.
> She regarded me behind her glasses before kicking me in the chest as I tried to stand, her foot planting me on my back
>"Stay boy"
>Her eyes measured me, before her toes pushed my head from side to side slowly before stroking my cheek and sliding back down my chest
>"Good boy. You'll need to shave Abit...but...I do like a little bit of scruff on my men" her voice carried a husk with it that made my cock ache with longing. However I was still firmly in the camp of "we want to live as long as possible"
>She removed her foot from my chest and stomach, grinning
>"Am I so beautiful you have no words left Maxwell?"
>"Breathtaking" 
>She didn't expect such a honest response clearly, her head tilted before she smiled "sweet talker.."
>And reached down to pull me up onto the seat with her, immediately leaning into my chest before taking a deep breath
>"...are you wearing something?"
>Did she mean a wire or cologne? Could she smell a wire?!
>"Just..a light mix"
>She buried her nose in my shirt near my arm "it's lovely..."
>My arm slid around her, more to get comfy than hold her close, but she snuggled in anyway, earning me a soft nip on the neck and a light lick across my throat
>Unsure of how best to proceed, I softly started stroking her, from ears to fluffy shoulders
>She sighed in pleasure, groaning which made my left pant leg a little tighter
>"Stupid meetings.." she growled, before leaning up to suck in my earlobe, gently nibbling.
>I was still terrified beyond rational thought, was this just some sick game? 
>My dick thought otherwise and throbbed wildly as her hand started slowly stroking my leg
>If there was any thoughts on if she was just toying with me, they were gone when she grabbed my free hand and slid it up her thighs to her panties
>She smiled and licked up my cheek "feel it?" Less a question and more of a pleading order.
>I gladly accepted, rubbing my fingertips along her thick cameltoe, finding a definite nub which made her Yelp
>"Wait! Nn..I can't get this stupid skirt dirty yet.." and she shoved us both down into the carpet, hiking up her skirt to one side, pressing my hand in as she rested her head on my chest for a long while
>Then she started scraping her claws down my shirt, slicing off the buttons with scary Glee 
>She giggled at my chest hair and eyed the treasure trail leading down into my pants with a lick of her lips
>I really hoped this family dinner party wasn't...cannibals or something!
>She moaned as she drooled and licked my chest slowly, swirling her tongue around my nipples before kissing her way down
>At this point, I wasn't really surprised by how flexible such a huge woman was but she soon reached what she wanted and let my hand go to crawl between my legs
>She undid my pants with her hands, gasping as my dick bounced free in my underwear
>She almost pouted "you're already ready? But I need a little more..." She growled
>Then she licked around my cock, through my breifs and suddenly with a RIP, my breifs were gone
>Letting the fabric fall from her lips, she buried her nose in my crotch, sniffling and licked as if to memorize every centimeter of it to taste and smell. By the time she was done, I was dripping with her saliva and twitching in Bliss. 
>"What..what is--" her finger in my mouth stopped me.
>"Hush."
>And then she raised her skirt and pulled her panties down enough to let me see her almost feral looking pussy, hot and twitching.
>"Very rare for a girl to have this, most men and women have human like genitals...am I disgusting to you?"
>I paused, looking at her face...and found a new woman staring back at me, full of shame in her eyes and fear. She clutched her skirt tighter the longer my silence went on. Clearly she had been turned down numerous times because of this..
>I took a deep breath, grabbed her ample ass with both hands and buried my nose into her snatch, pulling her on top of me
>I had a way with words, but I felt like showing her she wasn't a freak would work better in the long run.
>And in the short term, she HOWLED in surprise, gripping my hair and only managing mangled gasping moans as I ate her the best I could
>Her tail wagged furiously, beating my chest and tickling my still wet dick with the tip
>and soon she was grinding my face into her cunt as she babbled out her moans in a language I couldn't recognize, before promptly gushing and screaming her release as she clawed the top of the limo with both hands
>I was very happy afterwards that she had let go of my head, at that moment I was almost literally drowning in pussy.
>I did my best to drink her down, lapping and squirming my tongue into her sucking pussy with every trick I knew before she had to shove me away
>Before she grabbed me again
>And into the messiest kiss I ever had
>I'm pretty sure her lipstick smeared on my face and lips and the nips and hickeys she left on my body would mark me as hers for at least the next 3 weeks.
>Before I could even completely understand what we were doing, her legs had curled around me in a death grip and I was pulled into her oven-like vagina
>Pure overstimulation kept me from cumming right there
>It was like she was constantly sucking on my cock without even moving, so when she did start feeding me in and out of her slobbering puss, I could only hold on for the ride
>I came within a few minutes, and she held me there, balls deep in her, to feel my cock throbbing inside her with her organ doing it's best to milk every drop out and down into her womb to make babies.
>Then she kept going.
>I thanked God I had a very small refractory period, because it passed like a speeding bus, and straight back into balls-numbing pleasure.
>She came again, I think I came again, it was a blur of sweat and fur until the car suddenly stopped and didn't start moving again. 
>A knock came from the front window of the limo
>She snarled, even while riding my dick, before sadly licking my face slowly
>"The driver will take you back home Max darling...unng.." she moaned as she pulled off my spear as slowly as she could, almost sad it was leaving her 
>"But don't worry we'll do this again VERY soon...mm, and I'll have something to remember you by for the whole meeting.." she almost purred, rubbing her stomach and breasts before putting her panties back on, adjusting herself
>And amazingly it was like she hadn't just had sex in a limo. Back to complete business as she put on heels and opened the door
>She only turned back once, sadly blowing a kiss before vanishing to who knows where
>My dick ached, I needed water and who knows where the limo was actually going
>I laid on the floor and pulled over a bottle of sparkling water, and slowly guzzled it down
>Thought process could wait, my body ached.
