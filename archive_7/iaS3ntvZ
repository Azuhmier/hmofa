>It had been about two months since the military's big push into the quarantine zone
>you had been there to see the whole thing, just a few miles from where what could very well end up being the worst disaster in human history went down
>back then you were stuck here along with everyone else, outside the city and away from the initial outbreak but unable to leave and with no idea what going on just a few miles past the wall of tanks and armed men with worried looks on their faces
>now it was all "over" and you were all alone in your apartment building
>your other neighbors having run for it the second infected had started getting cleared at check points
>you should have left too, hell you wanted to but everything just happened so quickly
>after the military ended the communications blackout it all went down so fast
>one day you were surrounded by sacred, furious, excited people desperately trying to figure out what was happening same as you and the next day it was like they vanished
>right after that the busses and taxis shut down, then the airports
>once word really started getting out there were riots on the streets and desperate pleas to the government to try and keep it contained
>so yeah you were stuck here in your crappy apartment getting your meals from the back of a national guard truck as the city of freaks next door opened up into your neighborhood
>you'd seen a few already, the "infected" not that you and everyone else in a hundred miles wasn't infected already according to the news
>it seemed like the military was keeping the real mutants close at at hand for now but what little you saw still freaked you out
>women with fur and horns, guys with paws for hands
>even one poor bastard in a wheelchair whose lower body had become a tangle of what looked like tree roots
>you felt guilty but honestly it was more than enough to make you spend most of your time at home either trying to pass the time or get a hold of your family
>it was one of those nights when it finally happened
>another disheartening evening of unanswered phone calls and pointless shitposting finally drove you to open up your meager booze cabinet
>you took out a nice bottle of gin and poured yourself a little gin and tonic
>you headed to the livingroom to watch some more depressing news but just then you saw the kitchen lights flicker out of the corner of your eye
>you turned around and almost dropped your drink
>the bottle of gin you had left on the table was gone
>after checking to see the bottle is indeed gone you run around the apartment checking every nook and cranny for some kind of intruder
>doors and windows are all shut amd locked
>you are all alone
>you spend the rest of the evening even more on edge than usual
>you try and tell yourself you're safe and that there's no one in here with you
>and maybe there isn't, maybe the loneliness and insanity outside is just finally getting to you
>but then again you can't lie to yourself
>you've heard the rumors about infected getting abilities and as far as you know the idea of being trapped inside with a super mutant is a very real threat
>still you have no where else to go
>sure there's a hotline you can call to report dangerous activity related to the infection but what are you going to say?
>please help officer! My booze went missing!
>yeah that's not gonna fly
>taking a deep breath you tell yourself everything's going to be okay
>you retreat to your room and start to get ready for bed
>you don't even shower just brush your teeth and slowly get into bed
>you're going to be okay
>there's nothing in here with you
>you turn out the light
>........
>its dark
>you try to fall back asleep
>you were having a nice dream
>standing out in the middle of a field a soft breeze blowing blades of grass across your legs
>but...
>oh fuck something actually is rubbing against your legs
>you try to jump up only to have something grab you and press you back into the sheets
>giggling fills the room
>it seems like its coming from every direction at once
>there's a gun in your nightstand you just need to reach it
>there's the loud sound of liquid being gulped followed by a thud as something hits the floor
>"fuuuuuck guy I knew you were holding out on me!"
>"you young guys always have a stash somewhere"
>"buuuut don't worry!"
>"I didn't, I didn't steal it... you know!?"
>the words seem to slur together as you feel something warm and soft slither up your pants leg
>going up your leg it curls around your cock and starts to softly pulse
>you swear you can see it glowing under the fabric of your pants
>shhhhh that's right just lay back and let me repay you the voice whispers
>dispite the abject horror you feel at this moment you can't help yourself
>it's actually feeling good, extremely good
>like every neve in your member is being slowly triggered with each pulse
>within moments you've tented your pants and have to resist the urge to reach down and yank them off
>hah, I wish you could see yourself right now guy you look soooo freaking silly right now
>you like this huh?
>you like getting teased by someone you don't even know?
>totally worth letting a girl get a drink right?
>the tip of the thing in your pants begins to swell creeping up your shaft and pressing against your glands
>fuck you are enjoying this, you're a such an idiot
>you can't just let this happen right? What if this is kind of some dick eating monster? What if whatever is doing this is infectious
>oh god is this how you go? Disappeared from a locked room like a damn horror movie?
>the pulsating warmth in your pants gets faster causing your train of thought to falter
>your whole lower body starts to go numb as pleasure overtakes you
>you can't take this you don't care anymore your body needs this
>you feel yourself starting to actually relax your worries melting away
>the voice has been quiet for awhile now obviously enjoying the show
>with your last bit of energy you struggle against the bed kicking down your pants and finally revealing yourself
>you don't even care when you see the long glowing tentacle wrapped around your cock
>mmmmm good boy, I didn't expect you to be so eager it teases
>you're so close at this point you don't even care
>now let jus-GUH!?
>you hear the sound of a bottle being kicked and suddenly its like the darkness itself is coming down on you
>something large and furry lands right on top of you
>with a moan you finally let go
>its the biggest orgasm of your life
>it feels like it goes on of over a minute it just won't stop
>by the time its finally finished you feel like you just pumped out your damn soul
>which, if late night radio is correct about the infected you may have actually done
>it's amazing
>"d-did you just..."
>the thing on top of you speaks none of the smug confidence from earlier present in its voice
>"HOLY SHIT"
>suddenly it's like trying to pick up a feral cat
>the thing panics, scrambling across the bed
>you feel the sheets rip and claws dig into your skin but what the hell you don't really give a shit at this point
>"oh my god it's everywhere! I can fucking smell it jesus christ!"
>a fuzzy fist slams into your chest knocking the wind out of you
>a pair of angry green eyes glare at you from the darkness
>"YOU CAME ON ME YOU DICK"
>you see more glowing tentacles appear out of the darkness as the creature starts to dance around the room in a panic
>fuuuuck why is there so much!?
>with an frightened yelp the creature vanishes and the room goes quiet
>exhausted, drained, and most likely bleeding you pass out your, brain not even trying to process what just happened


>you wake up to the sound of thunder outside
>your room is dark and quiet save for the pitter patter of rain against the window
>you stretch and try to roll out of bed pausing when you notice your pants down around your ankles
>oh fuck that really did happen didn't it
>you hobble rush to the bathroom you pants nearly tripping you as you throw open the door and hit the lights
>you look over yourself in the mirror paying extra attention to your cock
>you look normal, no fur, no tentacles, no nothing
>most importantly your dick is in the exact same condition as it was the last time you saw it
>thank god
>rummaging around your medicine cabinet you grab your infection safety pamphlet
>going down the symptoms you breathe a sigh of relief
>you seem to be in the clear
>taking no chance's however you takean extra long extra hot hot shower that morning
>stepping out wrapped in a towel you realize something
>you feel fantastic
>its the dumbest thing in the world but for the first time since this all went down you feel accomplished
>you smile as you pick up the empty bottle of gin off the floor
>God you had a crazy night didn't you
>you look over at your torn up sheets then back at yourself
>not even a scratch, guess the infection is good for something after all
>feeling pleased with yourself you walk to the kitchen chucking the bottle into the recycling
>you pause a moment
>hmmm
>on a hunch you walk over to your liquor cabinet
>as if on que the cheap wooden door falls off its hinges clattering to the floor
>the drawer itself is completely empty the wood marred with frantic claw marks
>oh well, hopefully it'll be enough to keep what that was last night satisfied
>maybe the events of last night just haven't sunk in yet but all the fear you felt then seems like a distant memory
>your home was invaded and your body violated but here you are feeling like you could take on the world right now
a sudden knock at the door sends you practically leaping into your living room to take cover behind your couch
>you swear you hear snickering coming from somewhere
>your newfound confidence mostly shattered you rush to the door hoping you aren't blushing to hard
>the fact that you're currently buck naked wrapped in a towel only coming to your mind as you swing the door open
>GAH!
>both you and the creature on the other side of the door frame stifle a shout as you see each other
>its the most extreme mutation you've seen yet
>its body is completely smooth and featureless, with pure white almost metallic looking skin
>its face and head are blank and warped no eyes no nose, no hair, just a terrifying mouth open in an expression of shock
>it's wearing a badly shredded police uniform clutching a clip board to its chest
>the two of you stare at each other, each of you desperately trying to think of something to say
>the thing drops the clipboard and covers its non existent face
>I'm-I'm sorry..they said there wasn't anyone...
>it turns and runs down the hall arms head in its hands
>you slowly shut the door, shocked and feeling a bit sick to your stomach
>you slowly walk to your couch holding your damp towel around you like a kid squeezing a blanket
>that was a person....
>jesus
>you're suddenly very aware of how unprepared you really are for all of this
>a lazy shut in in the wrong place at the wrong time just lucky enough to be a few miles away from where people ended up looking like that
>you wish you were home, you wish you knew what was going on with your parents
>you wish you didn't feel so alone right now


>INFECTION SAFETY AND PREVENTION
>Help prevent outbreaks by following these steps

>1. Keep yourself and your property clean, avoid stagnant water and any unknown substances. If you are forced to use an untrustworthy water source remember to MICROWAVE it before other methods of sanitizing

>2. Avoid all animals and plant life. Any house plants should immediately be disposed of. All animals and INCLUDING SERVICE ANIMALS must be handed over to officials for proper screening. If you come into contact with any plants or animals wash your hands immediately.

>4. Practice vigilance with food and drink. Never consume food or drink you did not prepare yourself. Store food and drink properly. Avoid scavenged or open goods. Remember to MICROWAVE before any other from of sanitizing

>3. Avoid direct contact with infected individuals. Maintain a distance of at least 6 feet at all times. Even skin to skin contact can lead to infection. When communicating with stable infected be wary of both yourself and your surroundings. Avoid divulging any personal information and leave immediately if you notice any change in your behavior or thinking during the interaction.

>4. Report any suspicious or feral activity to local officials immediately

>5. If you have come into direct contact with infected bodily fluids or otherwise believe yourself to potentially be infected, report your location and condition, then isolate yourself immediately and watch for any physical changes.

>REMEMBER: mutation is not always obvious. In some cases it can take hours for symptoms to develop and physical changes to become apparent
>Look for these signs
>Sudden memory loss
>Minor physical changes such as change in weight or height
>Inability to think straight or speak coherently
>Intrusive inappropriate thoughts
>Sudden irregular cravings or desires
>Manic behavior
>Sudden flashes of pain across the body
>prolonged intense sexual arousal
>If you believe yourself to be infected and have already taken proper precautions start a journal or other record of your condition as soon as possible
>a journal can help you remember important information and allow you to track your condition.
>Studies have shown that maintaining certain activities such as reading, writing, and proper etiquette can help mitigate negative mental impacts of the infection
>A well maintained journal can also serve as a guide for rescue workers if you become unable to communicate or wander from your current location. It can also help doctors determine what strain you might have and what the best course of action may be for treatment.

>Remember we need your help to keep everyone safe!

>you spend the afternoon pacing around your apartment not sure what to do with yourself
>you lucky lucky idiot
>you can't believe you were actually feeling pride over last night
>you came so close to the point of no return before sheer luck saved your ass
>is wasn't fun, it wasn't romantic, it was stupid and dangerous
>you sigh and flop down onto the couch
>you really wish that thing had left you some alcohol
>you flick on the tv to try and distract yourself
>its the same bad news that's been on for months now
>panic, riots, govoners declaring lockdowns, taking heads interviewing scientists who are clearly trying to downplay the threat of the virus or whatever it is that's causing this
>still, the government does seem to be doing its job for once. There hasn't been a single outbreak outside the initial quarantine zone
>with how on edge the country is right now that's something to be thankful for
>if people saw what this shit could really do thing's would really start to fall apart
>flipping through channels you decide to settle on a marathon of old family guy episodes
>you could use some mindless entertainment right about now
>you stay like that until dark curled up on the couch half watching half listening to the rain outside
>you decide to skip dinner, you really don't have much of an appetite
>you feel yourself start to doze off
>POP
>everything goes dark
>its really not your day huh?
>your heart pounding in your chest you leap off the couch and sprint to your room painfully and loudly sending several things smashing to the ground as you go
>feeling your way into your room you rush to your nightstand grabbing your phone and gun
>you click on your phone's light and back your way into the bathroom
>the super bright led fills the room with cold light
>nothing there
>you try to compose yourself as you hold your gun out waiting for something to jump you
>you leave the bathroom spinning around like an action hero
>walking up to the window you open the blinds and peek outside
>through the rain you hear men shouting and see trucks going back and forth
>no gun shots probably just a power outage not an attack
>you breathe a sigh of relief and turn back to you bed looks like you're skipping showering tonight too
>shit you hate going to bed dirty
>wait.....
>when did you close your bedroom door
>"heeeeeey there guy"
>you smack face first into the carpet as you scramble over your bed to the bathroom
>if you didn't have the safety on you probably would have just shot yourself
>your phone goes flying and lands face down, no light for you
>you push your self up and stumble into the bathroom slamming the door and locking it
>no light, no way to call for help
>fuck
>you hear the creature chuckling
>wuzz tha matter guy I just wanna say hello haha
>a bottle kinks against the bathroom door
>I was gonna wait -gulp- wait until you fell asleep but BAM loghts go out
>so I -gulp-gulp- thought I'd check up on ya. Izz...Is not safe being a human all alone around here
>you gather up the courage to speak
>just stay back okay? I got a gun in here alright so just go home!
>go home? Guy you know I pretty much live here right?
>you pause
>-gulp- heh fuck yeah dude been watching your pink ass and stuff
>I...I'm warning you I really do have a gun in here you meekly reply. Wondering if the thing is actually being serious
>wut? You do? Cool man let -burp- let me see it!
>there's a thud against the door
>What!? No just please go! You're not getting in here
>whatever you say guy....

>it feels like its been over an hour at this point
>an hour of silence and darkness
>you can't calm down you know the thing is messing with you
>It could break down this door at any time and you're becoming increasingly unsure about your dinky pistols ability to actually protect you
>god damn it this is not the time to be a loser
>suddenly there's another thud outside you hear a bottle roll into the door
>you wait holding your breath gun at the ready
>nothing
>you remind yourself of your own stupidity as you undo the lock and perk out into your room
>still nothing
>you inch your way out nearly kicking a fallen bottle
>the carpet is wet and the room reeks of alcohol
>finally you see it
>sprawled out across the floor a puddle of black somehow even darker than the room around it
>okay no time to look for your phone just get to the door and get out of here
>maybe you can find a soldier or cop down on the street or at least get somewhere safe
>you creep to the bedroom door using the wall as a guide
>from where the creature is laying you see two softly glowing tentacles start to rise up and move around
>you shudder, did you really let yourself get jerked off by that?
>you find door and search around for the handle
>oh crap
>the metal door knob feels like its been crushed flat and practically bent off
>you desperately shake it unable to undo the lock switch or even turn the damn thing
>you look around in a cold sweat
>the thing is still on the ground tentacles swaying above it
>you nervously grip your pistol
>what are you going to do?
>you can't just shoot it right?
>that thing used to be a person they're just sick
>but then what?
>just hide in your bathroom untill you figure something out?
>you crouch low to the ground looking for your phone as you slowly start to inch back to the relative safety of the bathroom
>no sign of it
>you swear it fell over here
>unless....
>it couldn't have taken it right?
>you look over to the creature on the ground
>its gone
>something ever slightly taps your shoulder
>you stand perfectly still
>its impossible
>you're in front of a doorway in a small room there's no way it could have gotten around you
>there's nothing behind you
>you can't bring yourself to move
>god why do you have to be such a bitch
>a pair of furry arms wrap around you
>mmmmm yeah just like that
>don't talk dont move just stay still and let me hold you
>a tentacle comes from out of nowhere and whips the the gun from your hands
>you never even took the safety off
>the thing burps loudly in your ear before falling on top of you
>you hit the ground wrapped tightly in its arms
>a tentacle brushes around your neck practically daring you to call out
>shhhhhh the thing whispers in your ear
>it smells like a brewery and you can feel its bones through its fur as it presses into you
>up against its body like this it almost feels emaciated
>but it holds onto you like a vice
>you're mine now you big pervert
>all mine
>forever
>it nuzzles the back of your neck
>you know how hard it is to get cum out of fur?
>I had to run around smelling like spunk all fucking night
>cant..cant even stay drunk thanks to this ....thanks to this shit and now I gotta stink too?
>well now I'm gonna...
>gonna....
>you feel its fuzzy head rest on your back
>what the hell?
>after a minute you try and crawl out of its grasp only for it to grunt and squeeze even tighter
>so this is how it ends huh
>crushed eaten or fucked into non existence by a drunk monster
>eh, could be worse you guess
>at least it's kinda soft

>you wake up to the relaxing sound of violent retching and the loud click of the power coming back on
>stiff and groggy, you try to sit up, groaning as you stretch a bit
>sleeping face down pinned to the floor isn't what you'd call a refreshing way to spend the night
>you hear the toilet flush and the sink turn on in the bathroom
>huh
>looks like its time to weigh your options
>A. you could lose your shit and go sprinting out to the nearest soldier and start ranting about invisible monsters committing drunken sexual assault
>likely getting your place getting torn up by strangers and having to go through quarantine or some shit
>or B. seeing as you still appear to have your clothes on, the right number of appropriately sized appendages, and no hair coming out of your ears, you could ignore all the horrifying thoughts going through your mind, go make breakfast and see what happens
>you decide to go make breakfast
>you pull the top of a small plastic bowl of cereal and pop open a carton of shelf stable milk
>after mindlessly eating for a bit your nighttime assailant quietly enters the room, a floating formless black shape looking incredibly out of place in your humdrum apartment
>it just kind of stands there for a bit seemingly oblivious to you until you take another loud crunch of lukewarm frosted flakes
>it doesn't seem to really move but suddenly there are a pair of wide, bright green eyes starring out from the blurry patch of darkness in front of you
>after a few moments of awkward silence, broken up by the occasional bite of cereal the thing decides to make the first move
>uhhhhh hey
>you keep eating
>uh listen you....you didn't call anybody about this right?
>you shake your head
>oh....cool cool uh hey you wouldn't happen to have any Advil would you?
>putting down the cereal you silently slide over a bottle of pills from the counter next to you
>the blob of standing darkness seems to shimmer and you see the the bottle float into the air for a bit top popping off before being set back down
>back to silence
>uh hey could you turn the lights off for a bit, I kinda got a.....thing going on here
>you reach over and flick the switch leaving nothing but the dim grey light filtering in from the shades
>the black mass lets out an audible sigh of relief as it starts to shimmer again the shapeless fuzzy outline coming into focus
>you suddenly find yourself standing in front of a foul smelling, disheveled cat person
>far from the imposing creature of the past few nights they look almost sad, matted black fur and tired expression giving them more the look of a depressing stray cat than anything else
>um thanks
>It looks down at the floor, a long black tail swaying back and forth out from behind it
>um say...
>you wordlessly pass it the milk and another bowl of cereal
>the cat thing chows down with gusto milk dripping down into its already dirty fur, with a quiet burp it sets the empty container on the counter and licks the milk from its lips
>finally you cant keep it down any longer
>trembling you try you best to keep your cool
>WHAT THE FUCK
>the cat mutant nervously looks away, clearly trying to avoid eye contact 
>haha yeah..... I was kinda waiting for this
>You start blurting out questions 
>What are you, why are you in my house, what do you want what the fuck have the past two nights been about...
>obviously embarrassed they try to stammer out a response, tail wrapping around their leg
>well I uh...well I was just...
>you hold out a hand to stop them and look them in right in the eyes
>listen just tell me, am I fucked? Am I going to you know...end up like you?
>They immediately perk up a worried look on their feline face
>Oh god, I didn't even...No no you're good, you're good. 
>I uh, think....
>You THINK!?
>you are suddenly on the verge of panic
>I got a shot when then let us into the holding camps on the edge of town, they said it would "suppress our strains" or something like that.
>trust me, if you had something we would both know by now, it uh, shows itself pretty quickly 
>you lean back on the counter in a cold sweat, trying to convince yourself you're fine
>Listen, I know you're probably freaking out right now but I'm sorry, I swear I never meant for this to go this far. 
>I just wanted to swipe some booze and food, but this stuff, they point to their fur covered body, it puts ideas in your head ya know?
>gaining back your composure you look at the mutant incredulously
>you know breaking in and stealing shit is bad with or without attempted rape right? 
>why are you even doing this shit if the army let you out into the camps? You're obviously not feral
>for a moment they take on a serious demeanor and you're reminded that you are talking to what is basically a giant panther 
>don't ever make that assumption. Just because someone can talk to you doesn't mean they're in control of themselves or aren't about to attack you the second you let your guard down
>so you're saying I should have called the cops on you? you respond
>well....yeah actually
>I mean I'm grateful you didn't but it would have been the smart thing to do. If I wasn't so out of it when I woke up I probably would have made a break for it the second I got on my feet 
>you pause a minute
>wait are you not hungover right now? I swear I heard you ruining my bathroom
>they chuckle and point back to themselves again, whatever did this cleans out your insides like crazy it makes it a real pain to get drunk
>anyway about the whole camp thing, it went to shit really fast 
>long story short me and a buddy broke out and Ive been bumming around out here ever since 
>with how chaotic that place was I'm pretty sure they don't even know I'm gone but I don't think they'd be amused if they caught me out here
>They sigh, ears drooping a bit
>Okay for real, I am incredibly sorry and you're being a really good sport about all this which makes me feel even worse about it all
>Ill head out before I end up getting you in trouble but if I find any liquor laying around Ill see if I can replace what I took
>thanks for breakfast
>They start to move towards the door but you reach out to stop them
>wait a sec, I need to go make a food run today anyway and Id be happy to share, its not great but its better than stealing
>and well, you look them up and down, feel free to take a shower too I guess
>they look at you clearly flabbergasted before bursting out laughing
>hell guy, you would NOT have made it in the city dude hahaha
>but seriously....thank you
