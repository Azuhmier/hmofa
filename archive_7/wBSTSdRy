Your boss, Elyssia, wanted to discuss... well, what it was wasn't important since all she actually needed you to do was deliver the notice of what the meeting was for.
But it was also time.
As you sat down, you offered her the tea you prepared and she accepted.
You watch intently as she drinks, only to look away when she's done.
"Well then," she starts. "let us begin."

"... and with modifications to this side here..." Elyssia droned on about her walls.
You were hardly paying attention at this point. The anticipation was agonizing.
"Then we can... Oh." The rabbit had stopped talking and nearly dozed off before catching herself.
Trying to keep a neutral expression, you pour another cup of tea. "You look tired, Elyssia. More tea?" you offer the tea.
Wordlessly, she takes a long sip before setting it down. It almost looks like she's managed to pull through before she rests her head against the chair and passes out.
Perfect.

You move the unconcious body of Elyssia to the bed.
Reaching your hand out, you can barely believe this is really happening.
Saving your gold up, meeting in secret at the black market with the very real chance of being caught, and buying the sleeping potion.
All for this, something she'd never agree to if she was awake.
You touch her soft fluff.
It's incredible, the feel of it is beyond what you could have imagined. You stroke her fur as though you're in a trance.
Your hands sink deep and are practically buried by the heavenly fluff.
Unable to overcome the fluffiness, you shove your face into it.
You feel like you're reaching heaven...

After you've had your fill of feeling up of Elyssia's fur, you return her to her seat and wait for her to come to.
Sure enough, she wakes back up none the wiser.
You half-jokingly suggest she go to bed earlier if she doesn't want to doze off like that mid-meeting.
From that point on, her fur started looking unkempt after every meeting with you.
