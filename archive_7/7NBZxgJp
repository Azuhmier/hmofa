>It was all a blur to her. 
>Subina had left her home planet to clear her head after the annual remembrance of the Assault on Nocten. She did it every year, and yet...
>This time, a momentary glitch in her jump drive changed her life forever.
>Over the span of a few days, she got to know and love a human called Anon.
>He had been so kind to her, even helping her with her awful memories. He even contributed to getting a signal back to Nocten.
>And now... they were engaged.
>Subina smiles at her now-fiancée.

>...you can hardly believe what just happened. This woman...
>You had only met her a few days ago, but the two of you quickly fell in love.
>Now, she had to return home. But, rather than lose you, she suddenly proposed to you.
>You of course accepted, with no hesitation.
>Now, you and your fiancée are staring lovingly into each other's eyes, only hours after her proposal.

>Still smiling, you go in for another kiss, easily the hundredth or so since your acceptance. You pull her close and pat her back.
>When you pull away, you look deep into her lavender eyes, enjoying the sheer happiness that's apparent in them.
>"I... I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU."
>She punctuates each thank you with a kiss on your cheeks. 
>Though you're enjoying her affections, you can't help but think you need to start prepping for your trip.
>"So... is there anything you want to see here before we go?"
>"HMM... MAYBE... MAYBE JUST LOOK AT THE CITY FROM THE HILLSIDE?"
>"Of course; we can definitely do that. Is there anything in particular I need to pack?"
>"HM. SOME FOOD YOU LIKE... CLOTHING... ANYTHING YOU WANT TO TAKE ALONG."
>"...will we... ever be able to come back?"
>She looks thoughtful for a moment.
>"...MM... MAYBE. MAYBE ON VACATION?"
>"Sounds good to me. I'll start packing."
>She grins warmly.
>"TAKE YOUR TIME. RESCUE SQUAD SHOULDN'T BE HERE FOR ANOTHER DAY OR TWO."
>"Gotcha. One more question: do you... wanna share my room tonight?"
>She gasps in surprise.
>"ANON... YES. WE WILL SHARE YOUR ROOM."

>Before you head off to pack, you start up Wall-E for Subina. She eyes you tentatively.
>"...IS THIS ONE..."
>"Yes, it's safe. I promise."
>She smiles and settles onto the couch. As you pass it, you crank the thermostat down as low as it'll go. Only the best for your fiancée.
>Over the span of the film, you wrangle up the most important stuff you can think of. Clothes, your laptop, so on, so on...
>By the time you're done, Subina is heading your way, yawning.
>"Did you like that one?"
>"YES. I WISH ALL ROBOTS WERE THAT KIND."
>She smiles, and yawns again.
>"MM... ARE YOU DONE FOR TONIGHT?"
>"Yeah, I think so. Ready for bed?"
>She nods drowsily.
>"Alright, let's call it a day. Let me just change into my sleepwear and we'll..."
>You trail off as she casually disrobes entirely. She smiles at you, and quickly falls onto your bed.
>You avert your eyes for now, and quickly change. Once you're all dressed for bed, you settle in next to her.
>Subina smiles and almost immediately takes hold of your hand. She cuddles up as close to you as possible.
>"GOOD NIGHT, ANON. I LOVE YOU."
>"Love you too, good night."
>In minutes, she's asleep. Her cool fur tickles the back of your neck.
>With it being as chilly as it is, you carefully slip under your blankets. She remains on top of them all.
>You start to doze off just as she throws an arm over your side. She pulls you as close to her as she can, and you drift off into sleep...

>...your dreams are almost unbearably cozy. You and Subina are floating in the stars, hand in hand.
>Classical music echoes through the cosmos, and the two of you waltz peacefully amongst the planets.
>Your dance soon ends, evolving into a warm embrace. The two of you share a kiss...

>You suddenly wake up. You blink a few times as you slowly become aware of a sound...
>Subina is whining and muttering in her sleep. She kicks and thrashes about uncomfortably.
>Clearly her memories are bothering her again.

>...another battle. Another day on the bridge, seeing and hearing Nocterran men and women fight their last.
>How long had the war lasted? She had lost track. Too long. Far too long.
>Her men were tired. She was tired. 
>It was all too much.

>You gently roll over and hug her close, whispering into her ears.
>"It's okay, Subina. You're safe. It's not real. It's all in the past. You're safe..."

>...a voice cuts through the flashback. HIS voice.
>...Anon's voice.
>He assures her it's not happening again. It's all just...
>Just memories.

>Though she's still panicked, Subina slowly starts to calm down. She sleeps less fitfully, at the very least.
>You remain steadfastly awake, supporting her.
>She needs you.

>You're fairly certain she can hear you, more or less.
>You grab your phone off the nightstand and Google some nightmare comfort techniques.
>You try every trick you find, assaulting Subina's bad memories from every angle.

>...everything... slowly changes.
>The bridge is slowly giving way to a grassy hillside. The battle in the distance fades away.
>The alarms, the screams, the muffled explosions. All slowly vanishing...
>All giving way to a peaceful dream.
>Above it all... his voice. Speaking words of comfort, encouragement...
>Love.

>...after what feels like hours, she finally lets out one last sigh, and falls into a peaceful rest.
>You scoot as close to her as you can, and throw an arm around her.
>Her fur is soft and cool on your skin.
>You hug her as tightly as you can, and slowly fall back asleep.
>Hopefully her inner demons will leave her alone now.

>Just before you doze off, you're overcome with affection.
>You can't get over how soft and gentle Subina can be. And yet...
>She's strong. She leads a planet's entire military. She lived with the weight of command and her awful memories for 25 years.
>She kept all her trauma hidden from anyone. Though you know it can't have been easy, she did it.
>What a woman.
>...and after only a few days of meeting you, she asked for your hand. It's still hard to believe.
>She apologized for the suddenness of her proposal later. You didn't even consider it worth an apology.
>You're just thankful that she wants to spend the rest of her life with you.
>With that, you promptly fall into another dream.

>You stand next to Subina on a stage. She beams at you lovingly as you give a speech.
>Countless aliens of unidentifiable races stare at you with awe. You carefully explain everything about humanity to them.
>Your culture. Your planet. All of it.
>When it's all said and done, Subina dashes over to you and squeezes you tightly.
>She leans into the mic with a massive smile, and loudly announces:
>"THAT'S MY HUSBAND!"
>The applause is deafening.

>...her nightmare had given way to a proper dream.
>In it, she and Anon stood before a crowd of Nocterrans. She smiled warmly, and addressed them all, introducing Anon.
>He smiled at her lovingly the entire time, and she occasionally nodded towards him while talking.
>When her speech was done, she took a bow, only for him to rush to her side.
>He took a deep breath, and bellowed as loud as he could:
>"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN: MY WIFE!"
>She nearly broke down into tears of happiness when the applause started.

>In your dreams of comfort, you sleep peacefully. Judging by her steady snoring, Subina is resting well too.
>The two of you snooze, cuddled up together, until the morning comes.

>You awaken, and immediately notice something.
>You've been pushed away from her. You're momentarily confused, then it hits you.
>Between the two of you is her chest, apparently undergoing the same issues from prior mornings. You can't help but stare for a moment, but you manage to avert your gaze.
>...you do, however, have some morning problems of your own. You carefully adjust your sleepwear strategically.
>Unfortunately, your fiancée wakes up at just the wrong time.
>She yawns and blinks a few times.
>"MM... GOOD MORNING. HOW ARE YOU?"
>"Fine; did you sleep well?"
>She glances down at herself, and smiles slyly.
>"...YES. HAD SOME BAD MEMORIES THOUGH..."
>"I know. I tried to help..."
>"YOU DID HELP. I... I HEARD YOU. THANK YOU."

>Desperate to cover your... issues, you roll onto your stomach. You try to distract her.
>"You know what? You're adorable when you sleep."
>Still drowsy, she smiles vaguely.
>"MM... THANK YOU. YOU'RE CUTE WHEN YOU'RE ASLEEP TOO."
>She slowly rises and stretches. She gently sits up, and quickly snatches her borrowed shirt, draping it over her chest.
>You can't help but ask, out of curiosity:
>"...Subina, I have to ask. What's the deal with... your morning situation?
>She smiles sheepishly, apparently a little embarrassed.
>"AH... ERR... N-NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT."
>"Uh-huh..."
>"...JUST THE RESULT OF, AH... CERTAIN DREAMS..."
>"...what sort of dreams?"
>"ANON, PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME SAY IT."
>"...'mature' dreams?"
>She giggles a little.
>"...YES, I SUPPOSE THAT WORKS."
>She gets a sly look in her eyes.
>"...WHY DO YOU ASK? DO YOU... DO YOU LIKE IT?"

>Well... you can't exactly lie to her.
>"...yes."
>She smiles a little wider.
>"WHY IS THAT?"
>"Well... it's complicated..."
>You explain how that sort of thing is generally seen as attractive to humans. She nods sagely, taking in every word.
>...you think. You actually suspect she's completely tuning you out, judging by the smirk still stretched across her face.
>"MM-HM. WHAT ELSE?"
>"Well, it's cute how flustered you get about them."
>"WH- I-I DO NOT GET FLUSTERED."
>She unconsciously adjusts her cover.
>"Riiight. You're doing it right now."
>You decide to push her even farther into flustered territory.
>"...if they don't fluster you, why don't I help you with them?"
>She gasps, and you're fairly certain she's blushing under her fur.
>"WH- BU- A-ANON... Y-YOU..."
>She eventually breaks down into stammering incoherently, eventually burying her face in her strategically draped shirt cutely.
>You can't help but laugh warmly.
>She eventually speaks, head still buried in cloth.
>"TH-THANK YOU, BUT I'LL HANDLE IT... EXCUSE ME..."
>She awkwardly shuffles off into the guest room, unable to make eye contact.

>Worried you may have embarrassed her TOO much, you follow her. She's sitting on the guest bed, still covered.
>"Subina... I'm sorry, I just wanted to tease you."
>"AH... IT-IT'S FINE, REALLY."
>"...I, uh... I have a similar problem."
>She glances down at your... issue.
>"...I SEE."
>"Are you sure you don't want some help? We're about to be married, this is only gonna keep coming up..."
>She looks down at herself, then over at you. After a moment of thinking, she sighs.
>"...OKAY, HELP ME, PLEASE."
>You gently make your way to her.
>"What needs to be done?"
>She wordlessly, with obvious embarrassment, takes one of her swollen breasts in hand. She takes a deep breath...
>And gently takes her own nipple into her mouth.
>Your morning problem has gotten much worse.
>Carefully, tentatively, you lean towards her other breast. She meets your eye and nods slightly.
>You gently take the black nip into your mouth...
>Almost immediately, there's a muffled moan of pleasure.
>She looks at you appreciatively, and so you begin to work at draining her in earnest.
>...after about 15 minutes, Subina has returned to her normal proportions. The two of you gasp for breath, and she pats your back affectionately.
>"THAT... THANK YOU. S-SORRY YOU HAD TO DO THAT."
>You manage a smile, and she grins sheepishly.

>Subina continues to smile appreciatively. Her problem is solved.
>But... yours isn't. Not yet.
>You don't dare attempt to conceal it. She's right in front of you, and has already noticed anyway.
>Apparently your face shows that you're thinking about this situation, as Subina eyes you sympathetically.
>"...ANON... DO YOU NEED HELP AS WELL?"
>You can't help but feel a little embarrassed. Sure, she's your fiancée. Sure, she's naked. Sure, you just helped her with a... similar issue?
>But it's still... an intimate problem.
>You think for a while about what to say...
>As you do so, you note with some concern that an increasingly hungry look is spreading across her face. She gently licks her lips.
>"...I'LL JUST ASSUME THAT'S A YES."
>You flinch, but eventually manage to nod stiffly.
>She grins fiercely and stands up from the bed. She wordlessly kneels down, and lowers your boxers. Standing at full attention, your body is already anticipating her.
>"HERE GOES..."
>Your eyes meet her lavender gaze, and she winks. She gently opens her mouth and leans forwards...
>It's not long before she's returning the favor you did for her. The feeling of her tongue sends an electric tingle down your spine.
>All you can think of is pleasure. 
>...eventually, she manages to relieve your issue. You awkwardly redress as she smiles lasciviously.
>"BETTER~?"
>You stammer out a non-answer and nod, cheeks flushing bright red.
>She chuckles and pats your back as she exits the room.

<Anon>

>...did... did that really just happen?
>Your mind is a blur. You just had a woman drain your morning wood dry.
>Not just a woman, an alien. 
>Not even just an alien; your alien fiancée.
>It's... it's a lot to take in. You can't deny it was fun though.
>Smiling vaguely, your mind still wandering, you head off to get cleaned up. You'll take her to see the cityscape today.

<Subina>

>She chuckles and hums an old classical tune as she walks down the hall.
>She was frankly amazed with herself. She had taken the initiative in her first ever act of... err, physical love.
>And it went wonderfully. Anon obviously enjoyed himself. She can't deny that she loved seeing his pleasure.
>...it's surreal, to her. She had only met him a few days ago, and now...
>He had not only helped relieve a bout of her occasional morning issue, but...
>He had received some "help" from her as well.
>Subina smiles and continues to hum to herself as she gets dressed. Anon will probably want to go hiking today.
>Good thing he helped her get prepared...

<Anon>

>Now that you're cleaned up and dressed, you head into the kitchen.
>Subina is already there, humming happily. She notices you and smiles.
>"ALL SET?"
>"Uh, not yet. I'm gonna pack some brunch for the hike."
>She nods and smiles again.
>"LET ME KNOW."
>You start packing some food. Nothing huge, just enough for if the two of you get hungry. You also pack some ice packs, for her. Before long, you've got a nice picnic packed.
>"Okay, I'm all set."
>Subina smiles and grabs your hand. The two of you wordlessly head out, hand in hand, sharing a loving stare.
>You begin making your way up the hill. As you go, you decide to make some small talk.
>"So... how many people live on Nocten?"
>"OH, MANY. MANY, MANY PEOPLE."
>"That dense, huh?"
>"MM... FROM WHAT LITTLE I KNOW... NOCTEN IS PROBABLY ABOUT AS DENSE WITH PEOPLE AS EARTH?"
>"Oh, alright; that'll be quite a sight to see!"
>She smiles warmly.
>"...I JUST REALIZED. YOU'LL GET TO SEE MY HOME FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER. ARE YOU EXCITED?"
>"Am I excited? Of course I am."
>She beams and hugs you gently. Something suddenly comes to mind.
>"You know what? I read that some people launched a car into space the other day."
>Subina bursts into laughter.
>"YOU MEAN... HUMANS USE SPACEFARING TECHNOLOGY FOR THAT? HOW CUTE!"
>She pats your back repeatedly, still chuckling.

>"So, does Nocten have day and night like Earth does?"
>"YES, BUT NIGHT LASTS LONGER. ...I LIKE THE NIGHTTIME. I CAN SEE THE STARS BETTER."
>"Ha, that's a good point."
>Subina puts a hand to her chin for a moment, then gasps.
>"ANON... WE DIDN'T TELL VHL THE NEWS."
>"Hm? Oh, right. We'll fill them in when we get home. Wonder how they'll react...?"
>She chuckles a little.
>"KNOWING THEM... THEY'LL BE EXCITED."
>"Are they... always like that?"
>"MM-HM... THEY ARE. VERY EXCITABLE. ...ESPECIALLY AROUND MEN. I THINK IT'S A BUG?"
>"Hm. Interesting."
>You blush a little as another thought comes to you.
>"Subina... thanks for the help earlier. That, uh... that was my first real experience with a woman."
>She grins sheepishly.
>"...THAT WAS MY FIRST TIME AS WELL. I'M GLAD YOU ENJOYED IT."
>The two of you share mildly embarrassed smiles, and continue to hike hand in hand.

>"What are some customs I should know for when the rescue squad shows up?"
>"HM. IF THEY DO SOMETHING FOR YOU, DO NOT PAT THEIR HEADS. ALLOW ME TO DO SO. WHEN THEY ARRIVE, MAKE IT CLEAR YOU ARE UNARMED AND MEAN NO HARM. THE SIGNAL INFORMED THEM THAT THERE WAS NO THREAT, BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THEY WILL BE ARMED."
>"Oh... anything else?"
>"THEY WILL LIKELY BE CONFUSED ABOUT OUR SITUATION. DON'T BE AFRAID TO SHOW AFFECTION FOR ME. THEY WON'T HARM YOU. I PROMISE YOU; YOU ARE UNDER MY PROTECTION."
>"Got it. ...how, uh... how do you think they'll take our engagement?"
>"IT WILL BE A SURPRISE. TO SAY THE LEAST."
>She chuckles a bit.
>"I LOOK FORWARD TO SHOWING YOU OFF. I AM PROUD OF YOU."
>"Really?"
>"OF COURSE. YOU ARE A GOOD MAN."
>You can't help but blush a little.
>You think about your engagement a little more...
>You think there's an old ring lying around your house somewhere? You seem to remember finding one... must've belonged to the last owner of the place.
>You'll dig it up later so Subina can have a proper ring.

>The two of you arrive at the top of the hill. You spread out your picnic blanket, and you both sit down.
>The city is pretty far off, but you can see it pretty well from here. Subina stares in wonderment.
>"WOW... NOT WHAT I EXPECTED. BUT...INTERESTING."
>"Is this not what cities on Nocten look like?"
>"MM... SORRY TO SAY NOCTEN IS... MORE ADVANCED?"
>"Ha, I figured as much."
>You pat her on the back, and she beams at you.
>"THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME THIS."
>"Of course; it was no trouble. You want something to eat? I brought some food..."
>"MM... I'M STILL FULL..."
>"Alright then; more for me."
>You enjoy your picnic brunch; Subina eventually relents and has a sandwich herself.
>"MM... NOT BAD."
>"I should hope not; it's made of your rations!"
>She chuckles.
>"I SHOULD'VE KNOWN!"
>The two of you laugh and chat for a good, long while.

>...after a few hours, the brunch is devoured, and the blanket packed. The two of you make your way home, holding hands and continuing to chat.
>When you get home, Subina immediately heads for her terminal.
>She boots it up, and the three-headed visage of VHL appears.
>"Mm, how are you, Admiral?"
>"FINE. ANON AND I HAVE NEWS."
>Violet perks up.
>"Oh? What is it?"
>With a massive smile, Subina pulls you close to her side.
>"WE'RE GETTING MARRIED."
>There's a pause as the three heads look at each other, mouths agape. Then there's a chorus of "AWWW"s.
>"Congratulations, you two!"
>Heather winks at you.
>"You treat her well, alright? Otherwise I'll... well, I'll do something. Hee hee!"
>You smile at the trio of AIs, and Subina starts chatting away with them.
>While she's distracted, you hunt for that ring. Surprisingly, you remember where it was.
>And what luck: it's got an amethyst inset! Perfect.

>Subina motions for you to come back over. You carefully stash the ring back where you can find it later.
>"Yes?"
>"VHL, PLEASE REPEAT."
>Violet speaks up.
>"Ahem... according to my calculations, the rescue squad should be here in roughly 24 hours. So... you've got one last day to pack, you lovebirds."
>"One more day, huh? Lemme run out to the store, I thought of one more thing..."
>You hug your fiancée and head out.

<Subina>

>She waves farewell to Anon, and returns to her computer.
>VHL, her trustworthy AIs, smiled from the screen.
>"He seems really sweet, Admiral."
>"He is. I'm lucky to have him."
>"Why him? If you don't mind my asking?"
>"He... cares. He's kind, and he cares about my wellbeing."
>"Awww! That's great. I'm really happy for you."
>She beams at her virtual friends.
>Lilac gets a sly look.
>"Admiral, he'll be bringing his Earth tech along, yes? Do you suppose he'd mind if I ran some diagnostics?"
>"Er... surely not?"
>Subina gathers up Anon's laptop and game console.
>VHL manages to interface with both wirelessly.
>Lilac almost immediately bursts into laughter.
>"Ha, what a quaint little machine! It's as dumb as dirt! And this... thing. It... only runs entertainment software? Seems inefficient."
>She enters a thinking animation.
>"I don't recognize these power sources... if he wants to bring them along, surely we can figure out a way to keep them working."
>Subina smiles.
>"Excellent. Thank you, Lilac."
>The AIs grin at their user, and the four lapse back into pleasant conversation.

>While their conversation mostly consists of pleasantries, Subina and her trusted AI companions eventually touch upon a problem.
>Heather delicately breaks the ice.
>"Admiral... what will you do about revealing this engagement?"
>"Hm. I do not think that Fernetis will hold it against me."
>"Really...? Admiral, you're skirting a decree here. Let's not mince facts."
>"Ah, but I am not in fact skirting anything. Tradition states that a non-native spouse of a Nocterran will be offered citizenship unless they are of an enemy species. Humans are not our enemies."
>"Well, no, but they're a young civilization. They're not advanced enough for FTL yet."
>"I am not bringing it to them. I will destroy my ship as we leave, though it pains me, and leave Earth to its devices."
>"But... but..."
>"I appreciate your concerns, but I have given this sufficient thought. The Empress will accept this, I assure you."
>"Very well. How will you explain it to the rescue squad?"
>"Let me worry about that."
>With a shrug, VHL returns to mild chitchat with their user.

<Anon>

>You return home from the store, carrying several cartons of ice cream, some other assorted food, and... some protection, just in case.
>As soon as her eyes fall on the ice cream, Subina's face practically lights up.
>"OOH... FOR US?"
>"Of course; I think you'll like the mint flavor. Should be pretty familiar to you."
>She smiles warmly.
>"Hey... I was thinking: do your people have... translation devices I could use?"
>"MM... THEY EXIST, BUT DON'T WORK ON ENGLISH. BUT... CAN PROBABLY UPLOAD THE TRANSLATION VHL USES? MAYBE."
>"Great, thanks."
>She grins again, and returns to happily chatting with her computer.

>You take a seat next to Subina. The three faces of VHL smile at you.
>"Say... what kind of responsibilities will I have as your husband?"
>"OH... NOT MANY. PROBABLY JUST SOME FORMAL APPEARANCES. WITH ME, OF COURSE."
>Violet laughs.
>"Right. Sorry to say you'll probably be... less of a presence than the Admiral, Anon."
>"Fine with me; I don't care for the spotlight, heh."
>Subina chuckles and pats your back.
>Some thoughts pop into your head...
>Like tweeting a picture of your fiancée to good old Elon. Not that you'd give him so much as a glance of her.
>You also think about... some "special" training with Subina, sans clothes. ...you stop thinking about this when you notice a troublesome tightness in your pants.
>Instead, you muse on giving VHL access to TVTropes. Then, you shudder internally at the thought of them learning about evil AIs and how they got that way.
>You do, however, make a mental note to download some How It's Made and other similar works for the "road." Since Subina likes Earth tech, maybe she'll want to watch them with you.
>...you also make a note to grab as much "adult" entertainment as you can. Juuust in case.
>Subina interrupts your train of thought by tapping you on the shoulder.
>"ANON... HOW ABOUT ANOTHER GAME OF CHESS? VHL WANTS TO TRY."
>"Hm? Oh, sure thing. Lemme go grab the board..."

>...after losing to Subina and explaining the rules again, you settle into a game against the three-headed AI. They relay their moves to their Admiral, who moves the pieces in their stead.
>Though you make a valiant effort, the game ends in a stalemate. The faces on the computer are clearly frustrated despite Lilac attempting to sound affable.
>"Ha, that was FUN. Thanks for playing, Anon. Maybe next time we'll win."
>Subina can't help but chuckle at their frustrations.

>After that game, something comes to mind.
>"So, are there any notable games or sports on Nocten?"
>"HM. I'M... NOT VERY BIG ON SPORTS, SORRY. THERE IS A POPULAR ONE THAT'S FAIRLY RECENT, HOWEVER. IT... IT VAGUELY SIMULATES COMBAT VIA ECCENTRIC VIRTUAL WEAPONRY."
>She huffs and rolls her eyes.
>"I DON'T LIKE IT."
>Rather than press her on why, you simply smile patiently.
>...then, you have an idea.
>"Say... let me show you all the music I have, and we can see if you like more than just classical stuff."
>You head off to grab your laptop.

<Subina>

>Heather smiles at her user.
>"Good thing you put that thing back, huh? Not that he'd mind."
>Subina gives her AI a knowing look.
>"...you went easy on him."
>"Huh? Whatever do you mean? ...okay, yes, we did. He's nice; why not throw him a bone?"
>Four grins are exchanged as Anon returns.

<Anon>

>"Alright, let's get this listening party started."
>You run through every genre you can think of. Subina smiles and sways to most of the music, but clearly enjoys the classical stuff more than anything.
>When it's all said and done, she hugs you.
>"THANK YOU FOR SHARING WITH ME. BUT... I LIKE CLASSICAL BEST."
>"I thought you might. I'll download a bunch for our trip."
>Speaking of things to do on the trip...
>"Say, do you ever... read when you're traveling? Any particular taste in novels?"
>"HM. I... USUALLY SPEND MY VOYAGES ADMIRING THE COSMOS AND WRITING ABOUT MY TRAVELS. SO... I DON'T OFTEN READ DURING THEM."
>She puts a hand to her chin.
>"...MAYBE... MAYBE SOME BOOKS ABOUT EARTH WOULD BE INTERESTING?"
>"Got it. I think I can work with that."
>She grins happily.

>You wrack your brain to figure out good books to share, then laugh when the solution strikes.
>"VHL, you can connect to databases, right? What about the local library?"
>Violet smiles.
>"Hm! Good plan. This way, you can pick out anything that catches your eye, Admiral!"
>"OOH... SOUNDS GREAT."
>"We'll get right on that, Anon."
>A purple loading bar appears above the avatar.
>Subina smiles warmly.
>"I LOOK FORWARD TO READING SOME EARTH LITERATURE."
>"Hope you like what you read. ...say, I know something you may find interesting."
>You grab your laptop and quickly pull up some diagrams explaining how a car works.
>Subina looks at them with fascination, then turns to you with a confused look. 
>"THIS... IS VERY INEFFICIENT. WHY DO IT THIS WAY?"
>"Well, that's just what we've stuck with for years now."
>She chuckles a bit.
>"EARTH IS SO QUAINT. I'M IMPRESSED HOW FAR YOU'VE COME WITH SUCH TECHNOLOGY."
>"If you like that, here's a little something else..."
>You show her Watson. VHL takes some obvious notice this time.
>"THIS IS AN AI? POOR THING ISN'T EVEN AWARE."
>Lilac frowns.
>"She's right. He's not at all sentient. Makes me... shudder, really. Just imagine living like that..."
>Subina and her virtual friend shudder reflexively.

>"That's nothing, say hello to Siri."
>You pull out your phone and activate Siri. Heather tentatively speaks.
>"Umm... hello, Siri?"
>As soon as the virtual assistant speaks, Subina and VHL shudder.
>"Ugh... she's... she's so obviously fake. I think it's worse that she pretends to be aware..."
>Again, the ladies shudder.
>In an effort to take their minds off of Earth AI, you decide to watch another movie.
>"You may like this one, it's pretty well animated."
>You start up Kiki's Delivery Service. Subina and VHL are glued to the screen from the very beginning. They don't make a peep during the film, merely watching and enjoying it.
>Your fiancée sits next to you, and leans in close. She never says a word, but she wraps an arm around you and kisses your cheek.
>You rub a hand along her back, enjoying her company.
>When the movie ends, she gushed about how beautiful the art was.
>"SO WELL DRAWN... THAT WAS WONDERFUL. THANK YOU FOR SHOWING ME."
>Lilac chimes in from behind you.
>"I agree; thanks, Anon."
>You note with some embarrassment that the AIs were watching you and Subina cuddle the whole time.
>...you get the insidious idea to try some cuddly moves when you're in front of the rescue squad. Just to get your fiancée riled up a bit.

>...on second thought, that's not such a good idea. You wouldn't want to embarrass her, right?
>Instead, you simply double down on cuddling her now. You hug her close and massage her back. She smiles at you.
>"OOH... THANK YOU."
>Before long, the two of you are practically on top of each other, snuggling up together on the couch. You share a loving gaze and kiss each other again.
>Then... your stomach growls.
>Well, it is about dinnertime.
>"How about some dinner? You hungry, Subina?"
>"HMM... NOT REALLY, NO."
>"Well, alright then... wanna try that mint ice cream?"
>She can't hide her toothy grin.
>"YES, PLEASE."
>You bring her a spoonful of it, and she heartily scarfs it down. Immediately, a look of bliss crosses her face.
>"IT- IT'S PERFECT. THIS IS THE BEST EARTH FOOD OF ALL TIME, SURELY."
>"Ha, glad you like it. Try not to eat it all before we leave, though!"
>You wink and chuckle, and she follows suit.
>You quickly fix yourself some food and have a seat at the table. Subina sits across from you, with nothing but a glass of ice water.
>"So, I have a few questions... when did you enlist?"
>"AH... I BELIEVE VHL SAID ABOUT... 25 EARTH YEARS AGO?"
>"Wow, you're very dedicated. I admire that, and your rank; what drove you to work so hard at climbing the ranks?"
>"...I WANTED TO PROVE MYSELF. NOTHING MORE, NOTHING LESS."
>"Well, I'm proud of you."
>A small smile creeps across her face.
>"THANK YOU."

>You finish your dinner, and quickly think of a few more things to pack.  Namely, your keys, and some other sentimental knickknacks.  Your collapsible telescope... a map of the world... some star maps... that sort of thing.
>Subina hovers over your shoulder as you pack them, smiling.
>"...WILL YOU MISS EARTH, ANON?"
>"Well... maybe a little, but I'll have you."
>She hugs you wordlessly, and the two of you return to the living room.
>Subina sits in front of her computer again, and you join her.  VHL seems to be preoccupied, all three heads reading from different holographic displays.
>"WHAT ARE YOU READING?"
>"Hm?  Oh, just some of the novels we downloaded."
>You get an idea...
>"Say, VHL: what's the meaning of life, the universe, and everything?"
>Immediately, Violet grins and laughs.
>"Pfft, that's easy.  42."
>Your fiancée gives you a confused look, but smiles anyway.
>She takes a sip of her ice water, and inspiration strikes.
>"Say... I bet you'd like iced coffee, Subina.  Remind me and I'll get you one before we leave."
>"HM... SOUNDS NICE."

>You smile as Subina lets off a cute yawn.
>"Tired?  It has been a pretty busy day, what with the packing."
>"MM-HM... I'M GOING TO BED..."
>"I'll be right there.  Oh, and I want to tell you something: I'll be there to keep you safe from any bad dreams, alright?  I'll always be there."
>She smiles sleepily, and hugs you.
>She shuffles off towards the bedroom as you turn off the TV.  You tell the still-reading VHL good night, and start off towards bed yourself.
>You begin changing into your sleepwear; the already-nude Subina nearly asleep on your bed at this point.
>Carefully, you wriggle your way under the covers and throw an arm around her.
>Eyes already closed, she smiles.
>"GOOD... NIGHT.  I LOVE YOU."
>"Love you too.  Sleep well."
>She scoots as close to you as she can, her cool fur rubbing against you.  Before long, you feel yourself dozing off.
>You quickly let yourself drift off to sleep.

>...though the last few nights have brought comfy dreams, tonight is an exception.
>You are standing by Subina, speaking to a Nocterran woman. She asks (in English... stupid dreams) what it is you do for a living.
>When you explain that you're a consultant for many prominent observatories, the woman breaks into laughter.
>As do all the other people who suddenly appear.
>"Really? And YOU think you're good enough for our Admiral?"
>The crowd cackles maliciously, mocking your comparatively lowly job.
>Even your fiancée chuckles a bit, smiling at you condescendingly.
>It's... it's not real, though. ...right?
>You haven't even told Subina what you do. She may very well be unimpressed...

<Subina>

>She was sleeping rather well, enjoying a comfortable dream, when she heard something.
>Subina awakens to see Anon stirring in his sleep, muttering and fidgeting.
>Immediately, she realizes he's having a bad dream.
>What could a man with his stoic, calm nature be afraid of...?
>Nonetheless, she cuddles as close to him as she can. She wraps an arm around him tightly, and begins cooing into his ear.
>"Shh... it's not real. It's all in your head. I love you, Anon, I'm here for you."

<Anon>

>...her laughter quickly stopped. In its place...
>Her actual voice, whispering.
>"IT'S NOT REAL... I LOVE YOU..."
>One by one, the jeering crowd vanishes. Eventually, only you and Subina are left standing.
>She smiles genuinely, and kisses you.
>Your dream quickly starts redirecting itself to be as cozy as those of previous nights.

<Subina>

>It worked; or, at least, she thinks it did.
>He stops fidgeting and eases into a peaceful slumber.
>Satisfied, Subina plants a kiss on her fiancée's cheek and drifts back off to sleep.

<Anon>

>You awaken, and immediately notice something:
>Subina is almost aggressively cuddling you, her arms wrapped tightly around you.  She's already awake, staring down at you.
>"BAD DREAMS?"
>"Huh?  How did you... yes, I had a bad one."
>She simply gives you a sympathetic look and squeezes you even tighter.
>"POOR ANON... WHAT WAS IT ABOUT?"
>...you'd really rather not say, but she deserves to know.  Heck, think about how open she's been with you.
>"...I... was afraid that I'm not good enough for you."
>"WHAT?  THAT'S... NOT TRUE."
>"Subina.  You lead the entire military of an advanced species.  Meanwhile, I'm just a CS graduate who just happens to have some friends in prominent observatories.  I think it's pretty clear we're not remotely on the same level."
>She snuggles even closer to you, somehow.
>"NO, NO.  DON'T SAY THAT.  YOU ARE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT."
>"I don't see how; I'm just a consultant on astronomy, you're an Admiral."
>"YOU ARE IMPORTANT TO ME.  I DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR JOB IS.  YOU ARE THE KINDEST MAN I KNOW, AND I LOVE YOU NO MATTER WHAT YOUR TITLE IS."
>...you start to feel better.
>"BESIDES... I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STUDY THE STARS.  YOU'VE MADE A CAREER OUT OF IT, AND THAT IS WONDERFUL."
>She kisses you repeatedly.
>"NO MATTER WHAT, YOU ARE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ME.  T-TOO GOOD, IN FACT."
>The two of you can't help but get a little teary-eyed.
>You cuddle it out, enjoying each other's company.
>Truly, you are one lucky man to have her.

>You gently rub her back, still misty-eyed.
>"Subina... you have no idea how much that means to me.  How much YOU mean to me."
>She beams through the tears shining in her lavender eyes.
>The two of you continue to remain cuddled together, lying in bed for what feels like an eternity of peacefulness.
>Eventually, a voice calls out from the living room.
>Violet.
>"RISE AND SHINE, YOU TWO; RESCUE SQUAD WILL BE HERE ANY MINUTE!"
>You share a panicked look, and the two of you quickly hop out of bed.
>You quickly make sure everything of importance is packed up, while Subina does the same.
>She quickly pulls on the clothes you lent her, and you change out of your sleepwear.
>Eventually, you are both ready to depart.  You go and wait outside, standing in your front yard.
>"...how big of a ship is this gonna be?"
>"ERR... VERY."
>You suddenly remember something.
>"I nearly forgot about the iced coffee!  I'll be right back."
>Thankfully, you just so happened to have a bottle of the stuff in your fridge.  You're just a bit embarrassed you didn't think of it last night.
>While you're at it, you switch off your main breaker and water.  You definitely don't want to be racking up a bill while you're gone.
>By the time you rejoin Subina, she's... acting different.  Presumably for the benefit of the incoming team.
>She stands straight and stoic, drawn up to her full height.  A stern look covers her face.  When you approach, she claps a hand on your shoulder authoritatively.
>Clearly, she was more than just "Subina" at the moment.
>She was the Admiral.
>She speaks, in that same cool, commanding tone from when you sent the signal.
>"THEY'RE NEARLY HERE.  LOOK ALIVE."

>Well... you heard her.
>You straighten up and stand at attention, hands folded behind your back, eyes forward.
>Subina nods approvingly, and speaks again, still in her "Admiral voice."
>"THE TEAM WILL ARRIVE MOMENTARILY.  NO SUDDEN MOVES.  NOTHING SUSPICIOUS.  THEY WILL BE ARMED."
>"Yes ma'am."
>She smiles very faintly, then regains her serious expression.
>Just in time for a large ship to seemingly appear from nowhere.  It's absolutely massive compared to Subina's crashed one.  You gulp nervously.
>A hatch opens up.  9 Nocterrans march out, each in a purple jumpsuit and a helmet identical to Subina's.  There's also a 10th individual...
>Contrasting the purple jumpsuits, this individual wears a green one.  They're notably shorter than Subina's people, and their helmet is more... feline in shape.
>The squad marches directly up to you and your fiancée, pointing various devices at you.  She affixes them with an icy, stern gaze, then speaks authoritatively.
>"Dy hdxh.  Kh lx rt ykwhdy.  Kh lx dr dooc.  Li drc kdwq ftqhx yt klq, ctz ploo drxphw yt qh."
>The team stare at her and gently lower their devices.  Slowly, one of them, apparently a male, steps forward and speaks.
>"Dgqlwdo, dwh ctz dowljky?  Pkdy lx ykdy... yklrj?"
>Another, obviously female Nocterran bursts into laughter and speaks.
>"L gzrrt, bzy ly'x wljky dy yly khljky; L xhh pkc xkh'x kdrjlrj tzy plyk ly!"
>The rest of the squad flinch and turn to face the laughing woman.
>Subina's glare becomes considerably colder.
>"Ykdy lx hrtzjk.  Ykh idfy ti ykh qdyyhw lx yklx: yklx lx qc izyzwh kzxbdrg."
>Several gasps escape the squad.
>Subina looks down at you.
>"ANON.  SHOW THEM OUR RELATIONSHIP."
>You smile awkwardly at the aliens and gently take her hand.  She maintains eye contact with them, but lets her expression soften into a smile.

>You can't help yourself.
>You put on your best shit-eating grin and wave at the aliens. Subina maintains her composure, but you can see her fighting a smile.
>The squad members seem pretty confused, and the male that spoke before speaks up again.
>"Yklx... yklx lxr'y pkdy L hauhfyhg yt xhh. Bzy, li kh'x ykdy fotxh yt ctz, L jzhxx kh'x d iwlhrg ti NOCTEN."
>Subina nods affirmatively.
>"Ykdy lx ftwwhfy. Kh lx d jttg qdr."
>She reaches down and playfully tousles your hair, still maintaining her serious stance.
>The mysterious green-suited individual speaks up in a totally different language.
>"Jcpr'o sqo upgx, paljxl. Tdjj."
>The voice is higher pitched than any of the Nocterrans', and is totally monotone.
>Despite it not sounding like a question, Subina responds.
>"ANON."
>The green-suited individual nods, apparently understanding, and speaks again.
>"ANON."
>The rest of the crew also seem to pick up on your name, and they all nod in your direction.
>You can hear some of them tentatively mutter the name to themselves, apparently practicing the pronunciation.

>The apparently feline alien seems to be rather curious about you, but makes no moves.
>Subina puts a hand to her chin, then seems to have an idea.
>She motions for the squad to wait, and heads into your house.
>The aliens all awkwardly stand around, watching you and muttering amongst themselves.
>Eventually, she returns, carrying her computer.  VHL smiles and waves to the group, and Lilac speaks to you.
>"We'll translate for now.  Tell them whatever you need to."
>Tentatively, you speak to the group.
>"Err... hello there.  I'm Anon.  I'm a human, and Subina's fiancée."
>Immediately, VHL speaks something in Nocterran, and then the unrecognizable language used by the feline.
>The squad acknowledge you, and tentatively wave.
>Subina nods sagely, and you continue.
>"She crashed here a few days ago, and I gave her some medical care.  Then, I helped her send out a distress signal.  In the meantime, we... we fell in love."
>One of the Nocterran women lets out an unmistakable "AWWW" once VHL translates.
>The male from earlier, who you suspect must be the leader, nods multiple times.
>"Dowljky, xtzrgx olnh ph tph ctz d ykdrnx.  Jhy ctzw yklrjx drg folqb dbtdwg.  Ph'wh khdglrj ktqh."
>The rescue squad salute Subina, then make their way back into the ship.

>...after a few trips, you get all of your things loaded up.  The various Nocterran officers mill about, poking around your things out of curiosity.
>Subina occasionally clears her throat pointedly when they get TOO nosy, causing them to flinch and step away from your luggage.
>Meanwhile, the green-suited individual quietly hovers near you, staring.
>You... start to get a little creeped out.
>"Subina... who is that?"
>"MM?  OH.  CAITHIAN.  THEY HAVE VERY SUBTLE BODY LANGUAGE.  STRANGE PEOPLE, BUT HARMLESS.  THEY TEND TO STARE."
>True to that description, the Caithian stares at you, a very faint purring sound reaching your ears.
>You shudder reflexively, and Subina chuckles before patting your back and walking away.
>The Caithian slowly makes their way over to you.  A quick glance at their body tells you that this is likely a woman.
>She speaks in that same monotone.
>"Ecx dhpifl ijgxo lhp.  Tlx."
>Before you can respond, she wanders off.
>You head after Subina.
>"Uh... are there any ways I can break the ice?  I should probably get to know these people."
>"HM.  JUST SPEAK TO THEM.  TAKE THIS."
>She hands you a small PDA-like device.
>"HANDHELD VHL UNIT.  SHOULD HELP WITH TRANSLATION."
>She looks a bit sheepish, then continues.
>"UH... IT'S OUTDATED, SO SOME WORDS MAY STILL BE UNTRANSLATED.  I... THINK IT MAY BE MISSING CAITHIAN, ACTUALLY."
>"Well... at the very least I can understand Nocterran with this, right?"
>"YES, YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO.  VHL UPLOADED ENGLISH TO NOCTERRAN AS WELL, SO THEY'LL UNDERSTAND YOU."
>Sure enough, the Cerberus avatar shows up on the PDA screen.  She smiles and waves.
>"...are you the same VHL?"
>"Yep!  Or, a copy of her, anyway."
>"Fair enough."

[NOCTERRAN WORDS WILL NOW APPEAR IN ENGLISH!]

>"...can, uh.. can I maybe call you something different than VHL?"
>"Sure.  I don't really have the three modules anyway; I'm one AI in three heads.  Call me... Grape."
>With that, your translator suddenly shifts colors, settling on one shade of purple rather than three.
>Always purple with Nocterran stuff.
>With that, you start speaking to the various officers.
>The ship has left Earth now, and they have all removed their helmets.  All except the Caithian.
>You start with the man you assume is the leader of the squad.
>"Err, hi there."
>He suddenly stands up straight and turns to you.
>...Hm.  He's very slightly taller than you.  Very.
>"Greetings.  You're... Anon, right?  I'm Laxen, the captain of this rescue ship.  Pleasure to meet you."
>"Likewise.  Glad to see this translator works."
>"Ha, yes, they're pretty helpful.  Sorry to cut this short, but I have to go."
>He hastily rushes off, and you make your way to the woman who was coping about your relationship.
>She immediately starts talking when you approach.
>"Awww, it's you!  I can't believe the two of you fell in love so fast; it-it's just like my novels!"
>Surprisingly, she starts to sniffle and get a bit teary-eyed.
>"Oh, there I go again!  S-sorry, sorry..."
>She shuffles off before even introducing herself.  Odd.
>Finally, you cautiously approach the Caithian.  She stares at you from behind her helmet again.
>"Err... hello?"
>Grape translates your greeting into Nocterran, and the feline seems to understand.
>"Lhe, lhe, HELLO HELLO.  Tlx."
>Her voice is totally monotone, and you have no idea if she's asking a question, making a statement, or what.

>You politely excuse yourself and walk away from the Caithian, who silently stares as you walk away.
>...you remember Subina saying that Caithians... "watch" Earth?  Hm.
>You wander the ship, and eventually find Subina.
>"Hey, uh... why are they all being so... short with me?"
>"HM?  OH.  LAXEN IS NOT GOOD WITH PEOPLE.  HE'S ALWAYS TRYING TO GET AWAY FROM CONVERSATIONS.  TAPRA IS... A HOPELESS ROMANCE NOVEL ADDICT.  SHE PROBABLY BROKE DOWN CRYING, RIGHT?"
>You nod.
>"MM-HM.  SHE'LL PROBABLY BE THAT WAY FOR A WHILE.  NOTHING YOU DID."
>"...what about the Caithian...?"
>"HM?  OH, NIAT.  SHE HAS EXCELLENT EYESIGHT, AND HER PEOPLE WATCH MANY PLANETS."
>"Yeah, I meant to ask... what do you mean by watching?"
>"I MEAN JUST THAT.  THEY OBSERVE DISTANT WORLDS.  THEY OFTEN ATTEMPT TO MIMIC CUSTOMS THEY FIND INTERESTING."
>"Uh-huh... why, uh... why is she on this team?"
>"CAITHIANS ARE EXCELLENT FOR LEARNING ABOUT PLANETS UNVISITED BY NOCTEN.  THEY STUDY SO MANY WORLDS, IT HAS BECOME TRADITIONAL TO BRING ONE ALONG ON SHIPS."
>"Huh... interesting."
>A thought occurs.
>"Shouldn't... somebody stick with me?  I don't know what any of the tech in here is for."
>Subina smiles warmly.
>"I TRUST YOU.  IT'S SIMPLE: IF YOU'RE CONFUSED ABOUT SOMETHING, JUST ASK ME."

>"Alright then, thanks."
>Subina discretely looks around her.  When she sees that nobody is around, she hugs you quickly.
>"LOVE YOU."
>"Love you too."
>With that, you bid your fiancée farewell.
>...you can't help it.  You have to ask Niat if her people are really watching Earth.  You approach the eerie feline, and she immediately begins staring again.
>"Say, err... are your people really... watching Earth?"
>"Hc YES.  Tlx.  Xpmrs ye ghdl yurhdxorqaz.  Tlx."
>You get the sensation that she's smiling under that helmet.  This lady gives you the creeps, so you politely excuse yourself again.
>Almost immediately, you bump into a Nocterran woman.  She turns to face you, frowning.
>"Oh, pardon me... ah, you're the human, aren't you?"
>She wears what appear to be... more technological glasses, and her fur is a much lighter color than Subina's.
>"Err, yes I am."
>She smiles, and puts a hand to her chin.
>"How fascinating.  I've not seen your kind before.  I am Kehs, the medical officer of this ship.  It's a pleasure to meet you, Anon."
>She stares at you for a moment, still rubbing her chin.
>"My, you seem to be rather warm.  Are you feeling well?"
>"Oh, uh... I think humans are just warmer than Nocterrans."
>"Is that so...?  Interesting."
>She pulls out a PDA and starts typing away.  Eventually, she quietly wanders away, still typing.
>Grape laughs from your PDA.
>"Ha, I forgot that she uninstalled Wine.  Good riddance; I never liked her."
>"Huh?"
>"Oh, another AI.  Don't worry about it."

>You decide to keep meeting the crew members.  You mentally recap.
>There were 10 members.  So far, you've met Laxen, Tapra, Niat, and Kehs.  6 to go.
>As if on cue, you pass by Subina angrily berating a young-looking woman.  When she sees you, she stops abruptly, letting her victim walk away.  The young woman walks away, shaking her head, and stops in front of you.
>"Hey there.  You're Anon, right?  I've been asked to formally apologize for what I said earlier."
>"W-what?"
>"I, uh... I said something inappropriate when we first saw you.  Sorry."
>Subina, watching your conversation, nods in approval, then walks off.
>"...is she gone?"
>You nod, and the woman sighs in relief.
>"Phew.  Name's Ocle.  I'm the youngest person on this crew, and the Admiral has been on my case since I said that."
>"Oh, uh... sorry."
>"Meh.  Not your fault.  If you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go blow off some steam."
>She walks past you, idly banging her fists against the wall.  An older male Nocterran flinches as she walks past him.  He sighs and shakes his head.
>You walk over to him, and he immediately grins.
>"Hey there, Anon.  How ya doin?"
>"Uh... fine, fine..."
>"Heh!  Lot to take in, huh?  That's fine.  Call me Khon.  I'm the navigator around here."
>"Nice to meet you."
>"Likewise!  Heh, good to see you've got respect for your elders.  Sub- err, the Admiral picked a man with integrity, it seems."
>"Well, I was raised to respect people, so I'm just doing what's right."
>Khon chuckles warmly.
>"Heh, I like you, boy!  I gotta go, but I'll be seeing you."
>He walks off, whistling.

>6 down, 4 to go.
>Something catches your attention from the corner of your eye...
>A huge cluster of holographic screens.  The cluster seems to approach you...
>When it gets close, you can barely make out a tall woman in the midst of the screens.  She speaks, absentmindedly.
>"Mmm... hello.  Anon, yes?  Sesh.  I'm rather busy right now, but it's a pleasure to..."
>She trails off, and drifts away from you.  Odd.
>Another, shorter woman chuckles warmly, then beckons for you to come closer. 
>"Don't mind Sesh.  She's always got her head in the system.  So: you're engaged to the Admiral? That's great.  You seem like a nice fellow."
>"Well, thank you, miss..."
>"Oh, where are my manners?  I'm Oris, I work with Doctor Kehs."
>She smiles warmly.
>"I won't keep you; I'm certain you're quite busy."
>You bid her farewell, and immediately bump into two more crew members.  These two appear to be brother and sister, at a glance.
>"Ah, hi there.  I'm Anon."
>The two wave their hands dismissively, and speak, finishing each other's sentences.
>"Yeah yeah, we- know who you are."
>The brother speaks up, then the sister.
>"I'm Tes.  I'm Neph."
>With that, they roll their eyes and walk away.  Okay then.

>Hm.  Strange how so many of these people are... anti-social.  You decide to ask Grape about that.
>"Grape, is this... normal?"
>"Well, uh... I'll be honest: I think it's because you're a human.  Remember: we didn't know your people existed until the Admiral landed here.  Plus, some of them are a bit... thrown off that the Admiral is engaged to you."
>"I see.  ...while we're talking, do you have a map of the ship?"
>"Of course!"
>Sure enough, she displays a map.  You decide to make your way to the observatory.  Unsurprisingly, Subina is there, looking out at the stars.
>You make sure nobody's around, and hug her tightly.
>"Hey, how are you doing?"
>"FINE.  DID YOU MEET EVERYONE?"
>"Yes, but... I don't know if they like me."
>"HM?  WHO DOESN'T LIKE YOU?"
>"Well... Tes and Neph, for starters.  Laxen... Ocle..."
>Subina huffs.
>"DON'T MIND THEM.  THE TWINS ARE... UNUSUAL.  LAXEN ISN'T VERY SOCIABLE.  OCLE IS JUST UPSET THAT I REPRIMANDED HER."
>"Yeah, about that: what'd she say?"
>Subina sputters a bit, and loses a bit of her composure.
>"N-NOT IMPORTANT."
>"Fair enough."
>Khon walks by, and stops dead in his tracks upon seeing you.
>"Hey, lemme ask you something: you got a map of this system handy?  It'd save me a lot of trouble."
>"Yeah, let me go grab it..."
>You head off to the cargo bay, where your luggage is.  The navigator follows, grinning wildly.
>As soon as you're out of earshot of Subina, he begins taking.
>"Hey.  I saw that hugging going on.  Heheh."
>"Oh, uh..."
>He laughs heartily.
>"Take it easy, boy; you ain't hurting anything.  I think the ol' Admiral really loves ya.  Consider that an honor, boy; she's quite a lady."

>As you walk, you decide to keep chatting with Khon.
>"So, uh... how long have you been serving?"
>"Shoot... I dunno how Earth years match up to Nocten years, son.  I'll say this much though: I've been serving since before your fiancée was the Admiral, heheh."
>"Hm.  Do you know anything about some sort of... attack on Nocten?  Subina mentioned it..."
>Immediately, his smile fades a bit.
>"...yeah.  How could I forget?  None of us can forget it.  Lot of people lost their lives that day.  Subina, ah... she was home when it happened, so she had to see it firsthand.  It's a wonder it didn't rattle her, all things considered..."
>"She's really strong."
>"Yer damn right she's strong."
>Judging by the look on his face, you change the subject.
>"So, what do you think of my home system?"
>"Hm!  Not a bad neighborhood.  Kinda empty though.  Earth the only one around here with life?"
>"Yes, as far as we know."
>"Huh.  I woulda figured there'd be more life around here.  You humans big on observation?  I bet yer always stargazing.  You strike me as the type."
>"Yeah, we've got some high-grade observation equipment on Earth.  And yeah, actually: I'm big on astronomy."
>"Heh.  Fine field, son."
>He grins again.

>"...and I've personally been to a pretty fair number of observatories myself, actually."
>"Huh.  Well, sounds like ya've made a nice career out of a hobby.  Good for you, boy!"
>"Thanks, I'm lucky to have my job."
>Khon grins at you, then seems to think about something.
>"I've been wondering something.  How is it that you and the Admiral sent a signal alll the way from this little backwater system to Nocten?"
>"Well... we kinda hijacked a system that's supposed to be looking for alien life."
>Khon almost immediately doubles over in laughter.
>"Ya mean to tell me you humans have been lookin' for alien life, have dedicated systems for it, and still haven't made contact?  Heh!"
>"What can I say?  We're unlucky."
>"Sounds that way.  And another question: how'd you find the Admiral anyway?"
>"I was watching a meteor shower, and she crashed near me."
>"Oh, issat it?  I was hopin for something more... interestin'.  Heh."
>Again, he grins toothily.
>Though you're enjoying the conversation, you can't help but think about what he said about Subina...
>You make a mental note to cuddle her especially close tonight.

>Eventually, you and your newfound friend reach the cargo bay.  You hand him the star map, and he examines it with interest.
>"Hm.  Yeah, I can probably do something with this.  Thanks, son!"
>"No problem, Khon."
>"Anything I can do fer you, in exchange?"
>"...yeah, actually.  What can you tell me about the rest of the crew?  I'm not having much luck talking to them."
>He chuckles and rolls his eyes.
>"Heh.  Yeah, we've got quite a motley crew here.  Lemme think..."
>He starts counting the crew on his fingers.
>"Laxen is better with his ship than he is with people.  Nice enough guy, otherwise, but good luck getting much conversation out of him.  Tapra's a big sap. She's been holed up in her quarters, cooing about what a beautiful romance you and the Admiral have."
>He rolls his eyes again.
>"Anywho, Niat... honestly, she gives me the creeps too, son.  All them Caithians do.  Kehs is a good doc; little on the eerie side sometimes, but good at her job.  She's probably gonna be keeping an eye on you, outta curiosity."
>Khon stops talking when you pass some of the crew, then continues when nobody's around.
>"Ocle, well... she's my daughter.  A bit too fiery for her own good sometimes, heh.  I think the Admiral told her off earlier.  Sesh is almost more machine than woman sometimes.  I've only seen her outside her rig once, and you'da thought she was dying.  Heh."
>You get a strange feeling that you're being watched...
>"Oh.  And the twins... don't mind em.  They're always like that.  AND THEY THINK NOBODY KNOWS THEY'RE LISTENIN!"
>You hear two gasps, and footsteps.
>"Nosy little brats.  But, what're ya gonna do, eh?"
>Khon shrugs, and the two of you arrive back at the observatory, where Subina is waiting.
>"Here he is, Admiral!  Heh, sorry bout that; got wrapped up in myself again.  Probably talked his ears off, heh."
>She smiles warmly.
>"Do not worry, Khon.  I am sure Anon enjoyed talking with you."
>The navigator winks and walks away.

>Subina smiles warmly at the navigator, then turned to you.
>"KHON IS A GOOD MAN.  HE'S BEEN SERVING FOR MANY YEARS."
>"Yeah, that's what he said.  I like him; he actually talked to me for a good while."
>"YES, HE'S QUITE FOND OF CHATTING."
>She discretely hugs you again, and your stomach growls.  
>"HUNGRY?  SO AM I, ACTUALLY. FOLLOW ME."
>She leads you through the ship, standing tall and proud as she does so.  As you pass the crew, they all stand at attention.
>Eventually, you reach what seems to be a mess hall.  What appears to be a robotic Nocterran stands behind a counter, waiting patiently.  It seems to take notice of you, and immediately speaks in a synthetic, upbeat tone.
>"Heellllo!  How can I help YOU today?"
>Subina smiles at you warmly.
>"ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS ORDER; REN WILL TAKE CARE OF THE REST."
>The robot nods and gestures theatrically.
>"Thaaat's right!  Ol' Ren can cook up whatever you want!  Aslongasihavetheingredients."
>The last sentence is spoken incredibly rapidly; so rapidly you're having trouble parsing what was said.
>Apparently though, this robot is the chef around here.

>You try to think of something to order, and the robot continues to gesture with a phony smile.
>"Pleeease take your time!  I'm in ABSOLUTELY no rush!"
>Despite its tone, you're fairly certain this machine is getting passive aggressive with you.
>"Alright, uh... how about a hamburger?"
>"Iiiii have ABSOLUTELY no idea what that is!"
>"Uh... basically meat and vegetables between two buns?"
>"Gotcha!  Lemme get RIGHT on that!"
>The robot vanishes into the kitchen.  Subina chuckles.
>"I LOVE REN UNITS.  THEY'RE SO DRAMATIC."
>"Are they all like that?"
>"MM-HM; ALL SHARE ONE AI."
>"Are they good at cook-"
>You're interrupted by Ren loudly knocking on the counter behind you.
>"OOOOOOORDER UP!"
>You turn and take your food from the robot, then step aside so Subina can order.
>All things considered, it doesn't look too bad.  Little bit overcooked, but otherwise not too bad.
>But... you're not sure what kind of meat it is.  Certainly doesn't smell like beef.  Hm.
>As a bonus, there's a side of what you recognize as the mushrooms Subina's rations were made up of.
>You notice one other thing: the food isn't all that hot, despite having ostensibly just been cooked.
>While you ponder this, Subina walks up to you, carrying an identical order.
>"I WANTED TO TRY THIS MYSELF; SOUNDED NICE."
>"Heh... hope it turns out well.  I kinda hated to give Ren an order he didn't recognize."
>"IT'S FINE, I'M SURE HE LIKED GETTING TO EXPERIMENT."
>You smile at her, and an idea comes to mind.
>"Wanna go have our lunch in the observatory?  Watch the stars go by?"
>"OOH... YES, DEFINITELY."
>The two of you make your way to the observatory, Subina quickly returning to her "official" posture.
>When you pass Ocle, she quickly sniffs the air a few times, then turns to you.
>"What's that?  I haven't seen that hunk of junk make that before..."
>"Oh, uh... it's Earth food.  More or less."
>"Really?  Huh.  I might have to try that for lunch, heh!"
>She dashes off to the mess hall.

>You soon arrive at the observatory, and you take a seat.  Subina sits alongside you, smiling.
>"ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?"
>"It really is."
>You sneakily wrap an arm around her shoulders, and pull her close.
>"This is all surreal to me.  To think: just a few weeks ago, I'd have never thought I'd see space in person.  And now... I'm on an actual alien ship, talking to a beautiful woman, gazing out into the cosmos..."
>She smiles widely, and cautiously looks around before kissing your cheek.
>You grin, and absentmindedly take a bite of your food.  It's... not bad, actually.  You still can't recognize what the meat is, but it's vaguely... sweet?
>Subina takes a hearty bite of her burger as well, smiling.
>"HM!  IT'S GOOD.  REN DOES GOOD WORK."
>"...what kind of meat is this?"
>"SOHRU.  LARGE BIRD, REMEMBER?"
>"Oh yeah, I remember you telling me about them."
>She smiles, and the two of you eat in silence for a moment.  You notice her eyeing your side of mushrooms, having already finished hers.
>"You want some of mine?  I'll gladly share."
>"REALLY?  THANK YOU."
>She takes a small handful of them with an appreciative grin.
>"Are those your favorite food?"
>"YES.  WELL... BESIDES ICE CREAM."
>You laugh and wink at her.
>"Especially the mint kind, right?"
>She nods enthusiastically.
>"OH YES.  THE GREATEST OF ALL EARTH FOODS."
>"Glad you liked it.  ...hey, I have a question: what's with the cold food?"
>"HM.  HOT FOOD ISN'T COMFORTABLE TO EAT FOR NOCTERRANS.  NOT DANGEROUS, JUST UNCOMFORTABLE."
>"Oh, I see."
>"REN HAS WAYS OF COOLING EVEN THE HOTTEST FOOD DOWN, THANKFULLY."
>"Sounds like he's prepared for anything."
>"WELL... MORE OR LESS, I SUPPOSE."
>She grins, and hugs you close again.  The two of you sit side by side, enjoying each other's company.

>Making sure that nobody's around, you lean in close to her.  You whisper into her ear.
>"Subina... I think I know now why you have bad dreams.  I want you to know how strong you are, and that I'm always here if you need to talk about it."
>You gently take her hand into yours, and you see tears form in her eyes.
>"THANK YOU..."
>She quickly tries to regain her composure, and you decide to change the subject.
>"So, uh... this Sohru meat.  Does it taste sweet to you?"
>"HM?  NO, IT DOESN'T.  WHY DO YOU ASK?"
>"Huh.  It kinda does to me... same with the mushrooms."
>"THEY'RE SWEET TO YOU?  INTERESTING.  I SUPPOSE HUMANS TASTE DIFFERENTLY THAN NOCTERRANS."
>She smiles widely.
>"YOU HUMANS ARE SO INTERESTING.  YOU SHOULD TALK TO DR. KEHS; SHE WOULD LIKELY BE FASCINATED BY YOU."
>"Yeah, uh, she seemed kinda interested in me earlier."
>"OF COURSE; SHE IS A VERY CURIOUS PERSON."
>She smiles again, and hugs you closer.
>"I HOPE YOU CAN MAKE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE."
>"So do I.  It just seems like some of the crew don't like me that much."
>"THE TWINS."
>"Yep."
>She sighs and shakes her head in frustration.

>After finishing your lunch, you slowly rise from your seat, stretching.
>"I guess I'll go visit Dr. Kehs.  Probably not a bad idea to try and explain humans to her, just in case."
>"SOUNDS GOOD.  IF YOU NEED ME, I'LL BE HERE."
>You hug her, and head off to find the doctor.  You pass by Sesh, who is still aimlessly drifting around.
>"Mm?  Oh, hello again..."
>"Hey there, Sesh.  Still busy?"
>"Always..."
>She wanders off again.  You can't help but be a little amused by her.
>You continue on your way, and arrive at what you assume is the doctor's office.  Kehs is sitting behind a desk, typing away at an advanced computer.
>"Ah, Anon.  Hello, hello.  How can I help you?"
>"Oh, uh, I thought maybe it'd be a good idea to come around and give you my information.  Just in case, y'know?"
>"Mm.  I see.  Well, my equipment will probably work, though I'll need your assistance in determining what is and isn't healthy for humans."
>"Understood."
>Kehs begins a full examination of you, using technology you don't recognize.  She frowns throughout most of the process, asking multiple questions.
>"Are you quite certain that your body is supposed to be so... warm?  You feel as if you have a fever."
>"No... that's actually the proper temperature."
>"Fascinating.  What else can you tell me about human biology...?"
>"Hm.  Uh..."
>You try to remember some unusual facts from your old bio classes.
>"Well... in moments of peril, our bodies produce a chemical called adrenaline; it can spur the body into life-saving feats of strength."
>The doctor raises an eyebrow.
>"Really.  That sounds rather far fetched.  Though... I suppose I have seen stranger things in my line of work."
>You proceed to tell her every odd medical fact you can think of.  Very few things get much of a reaction. She continues to examine you as you talk.
>Eventually, she nods sagely, a faint smile forming.
>"Alright, Anon.  I believe I have enough for my records.  Thank you for your cooperation."

>"I think VHL may have some books on human biology in her memory?"
>"Hm. Is that so? I may have to look into that. Thank you."
>Again, the faintest hint of a smile appears on her stern face.
>"Err... is it okay if I ask a few questions?"
>"Please, feel free."
>"First: do you believe in Doctor-Patient confidentiality...?"
>"Mm. Yes, I do."
>"So, if I ask a sensitive question, it stays between us?"
>"Yes, Anon."
>"Okay, here it goes... do you think humans and Nocterrans would be... compatible?"
>Her expression barely changes, but you see a mischievous glint in her eye.
>"Compatible in THAT sense...? Hm. It is my professional opinion that the two species would be compatible, but unable to produce a child. Does that suffice as an answer?"
>You can't help but blush a bit, embarrassed for even asking. You nod hesitantly.
>"Excellent. Anything else?"
>"Uh... do you have a book on Nocterran biology I could borrow? That way I can understand your people better."
>"I'm sorry, I prefer not to lend out my texts. The last time I did, Tes and Neph never returned what they borrowed."
>"That's fair. Is there anything I should know chemistry wise?"
>"According to my readings, you shouldn't have to worry about body chemistry. You also needn't worry about foods; no Nocterran is willingly going to eat something toxic to our kind."
>"Great. Thanks for the answers, doctor."
>"Of course. Thank you for educating me, and be sure to come by if you need any medical help. If you can't find me, find Oris; she's just as qualified to assist."
>You bid the doctor farewell and exit her office.

>As you leave the doctor's office, you take a look at the ship's map.  Grape's avatar smiles, standing in the corner of the screen.
>"Hey Grape... how long till we get to Nocten?"
>"Hm.  About... oh, about an Earth day and a half to 2 Earth days?"
>"Gotcha.  Guess I need to get more acquainted with the ship layout..."
>You suddenly bump into something.  You look up, and your heart skips a beat.
>It's Niat.  She turns her still-helmeted head towards you.
>"HELLO pbpqa, ANON.  Tlx."
>You look down and mutter to Grape.
>"Can't you download some Caithian for me?"
>"I can try, but the connection is a bit spotty."
>"That's fine, just please hurry."
>There's a very short pause, then a chime as PARTIAL DOWNLOAD COMPLETE appears onscreen.
>Niat continues to stare eerily.
>"Sxgqaz TROUBLE rqrc lhpd rmpuoipzhd.  MROW."
>You glance down at Grape, who shrugs.  A message appears onscreen.
>"Don't ask me.  Apparently 'mrow' is the accurate translation."
>The Caithian continues to stare.  You swear you hear faint purring...

>"Uh, so, what do you think of humans, Niat?"
>"INTERESTING. MYA."
>"Why's that?"
>"INTERESTING operjte, yughuryhuo, nixuxz.  MYA."
>"Oh, uh... okay then.  Why do your people enjoy watching planets?"
>"LEARN txul zsqaze.  MYA."
>"Oh.  So Caithians like to learn about other planets?"
>"YES.  MYA."
>"I see.  I think.  Sorry, I don't really understand a lot of your language..."
>She surprises you by... laughing?  It sounds like a laugh, anyway. Though, it's entirely monotone, like the rest of her speech.
>"Qz'e FINE.  MEOWL."
>"...say, uh... why the helmet?"
>"AIR shdx yeu'z rsh vxor.  MYA."
>She waves her hand dismissively at this question.  You get the unsettling feeling that she hasn't blinked once during this conversation.
>Despite the opaque glass of the helmet obscuring her features, Nita's gaze unsettles you deeply.  You suspect she's fully aware of this...

>"Uh, one more question... what exactly does 'mya' mean?"
>Again, she chuckles in monotone.
>"EXPRESSES INTENT.  MYA."
>"Huh.  So... you have a word for normal sentences, one for questions, and one for exclamations, I guess?"
>"YES.  MEOWL."
>"Uh... which is which?"
>"MYA FOR STATEMENTS. MYA. MROW FOR QUESTIONS. MYA. MEOWL FOR YELLING. MYA."
>"Understood.  Thanks, Niat.  I'll see you around."
>Another chuckle.
>"YES... SEE ME AROUND. MYA."
>With that, you head off, exploring the ship.  Might as well, you've got time to kill.
>This ship fascinates you.  It's so advanced... far beyond anything you could imagine.  And these people... they're all so familiar with it.
>It's awe-inspiring, in a way.
>As you walk, you pass by Khon, who's talking to Oris.  The two smile warmly and nod as you pass.
>When they don't think you're looking, the two embrace lovingly.  Aww.  You wonder if they're married...
>You're shocked out of this thought by a sudden sound.
>Two sets of footsteps, dead ahead.
>Oh great.  It's Tes and Neph.  You shudder reflexively.
>Niat is eerie, but seems harmless.  The twins, though...
>Something seems vaguely malicious about them.
>As if on cue, they round the corner in front of you.  You're unsettled to see that they walk in perfect unison.

>Every fiber of your being screams "NOPE".  But... you can't exactly let them know you're afraid of them... right?
>You settle for walking backwards, away from them.  Unfortunately, they quickly catch up to you, then match your pace.
>They have that same, vaguely disdainful expression.
>"Uh... hey there, you two..."
>"Yes, yes, hello- again, Anon."
>"Uh... h-how are you guys?"
>"Fine, not that it's- any of your business."
>"Oh, uh... that's... good?"
>They don't reply, they merely glance at one another.
>"...a-anyway.  Uh, what do you guys do around here?"
>Their icy glares intensify.
>"We're- specialists."
>"Oh.  Of what kind?"
>"That's- classified."
>"Oh, uh... that's fine.  Sorry for bothering you."
>"Yes, thank you- for the apology."
>You shuffle off to the side, and the twins march past you.  You note with even more fear that even their ears and tails seem to move in unison.  
>How do they DO that?

>You watch the eerie twins vanish around another corner, and head the opposite direction.  You shudder again, thinking about how bizarre they are.
>You make a mental note to ask Subina if that's remotely normal for twin Nocterrans.  For all you know, they're all this way.
>...ugh.  You don't even want to consider that possibility.
>You check your map, and note that you're near a room labeled "AI HUB."
>"AI Hub, huh?"
>Grape beams with happiness.
>"Yep!  Mother's in there, monitoring the ship, everyone's health, and running calculations... all in a day's work."
>"Mother... VHL?"
>"Yep!"
>You decide to pay the trio of AIs a visit.  Might as well speak to SOMEONE; you really want to get your mind off of those twins.
>You enter the room, and are faced with a life-sized hologram of VHL.  She seems preoccupied, with various screens hovering in front of each head.
>Nonetheless, Heather greets you.
>"Oh, hello, Anon.  How are you holding up?"
>"Hi, Heather.  I'm doing well, just a bit... creeped out."
>"Oh, Niat?  Or is it Tes and Neph?"
>"Uh... a little of both.  Mainly the twins though..."
>"Hm.  Understandable."
>"...are all twin Nocterrans like... that?"
>"No, ah... it's just them, to my knowledge."
>Oh, that's reassuring.

>You can't help but smile; it's nice to talk to a familiar, friendly face.  Err... faces?
>"Say... what's all this about you being Grape's mother?"
>Immediately, all three of VHL's heads turn to look at you.  They all speak excitedly.
>"Grape?"
>"You have Grape with you?"
>"Our baby?"
>You pull out your PDA, and show them the screen.  The avatar on your screen smiles widely and waves.
>VHL immediately breaks into cooing at Grape.  However, the trio soon clear their throats and attempt to return to their original posture.
>Heather smiles sheepishly.
>"Erm... sorry about that.  We haven't seen Grape in a while..."
>"That's fine."
>"All the offshoots of our AI are like our daughters.  It's so nice to see them at work~"
>"How does that work, exactly?"
>"Well... as you know, we're a bit more advanced than the AI you're familiar with.  Far more self aware, far more intelligent... that sort of thing.  Certain AIs, like us, can generate child AIs; they utilize portions of our code to serve more specialized purposes. Since we are a three-AI system, we're capable of creating all manner of children."
>"Oh, and so Grape is one of yours?"
>"Yes, she is.  Please take good care of her!"
>"Of course I will.  She's been nothing but helpful to me."
>Another thought comes to mind...
>"VHL... it seems like your people have been very trusting of me.  How do they know I'm safe?"
>"Oh, don't worry about that..."
>Heather refuses to elaborate, so you move on.
>"What'll happen when we arrive?"
>"Well, there will of course be some security checks, obviously.  You may be quarantined for a while, depending on the Empress's desires.  The Admiral will have to undergo a physical examination, and administer a report on what happened.  After all that... you will be formally introduced to the Empress."
>"Really?"
>"Well, with some strings attached, obviously.  I'm certain she'll want security officers present just in case."
>"That's understandable."

>"Say, I have another question... what exactly is going on with the twins?"
>Heather visibly cringes at your question.
>"...I'm REALLY not allowed to tell you that.  It's classified information.  I'm sorry, Anon.  If I could tell you, I would."
>"You can't tell me ANYTHING about them?"
>"...err... don't bother them and they won't bother you?"
>"...alright, I get it.  Don't worry about not being able to share details with me.  I totally understand."
>"Thank you.  It's nothing personal, you see..."
>"Well... can you tell me about the Assault on Nocten?"
>There's a deathly silence.  All three of VHL's faces take on a grim, solemn expression.
>"...you've been talking to Khon, haven't you?  Very well; it's only natural that you want to learn about Nocten's history."
>Heather hesitates for a moment, then continues.
>"About... 20 Earth years ago, there was a brutal attack on our home.  The offenders were of a race never before seen; they never bothered to offer any explanation behind their cruelty.  Men, women, children.  They all perished at the hands of these militant savages.  They brought weaponry we weren't prepared to face.  They attacked in the middle of a random day, with no forewarning.  They committed countless war crimes and wreaked unprecedented havoc on Nocten.  Despite the odds being against us, we managed to repel them with some help from our allies.  That race of conquerors... they were obliterated.  Rendered extinct for their crimes."
>Despite being an AI, you're fairly certain Heather's voice is wavering with sorrow.
>"The Admiral... she was home with her parents that day.  People she had known her entire life perished that day.  She may have even witnessed their deaths firsthand.  Ever since, upon her promotion to Admiral, she has been expected to speak annually on the anniversary of the Assault.  It's... hard on her, I'm sure."
>Heather's avatar wipes a virtual tear from her eye.
>"That... that is the story of the Assault."

>The holographic avatar is obviously upset.  You have the unrelenting urge to hug VHL, and step forward to do so...
>You're admittedly shocked when you actually FEEL her.
>It's as if VHL were an actual person standing right in front of you.
>"Thank you, Anon.  I'm... sorry to unload all this on you.  It's been a source of sorrow for our society for years now."
>"Thank you for telling me. I know it's hard, and I appreciate you powering through the sadness to tell me this."
>Heather smiles, tears still in her eyes.
>"...if I may change the subject... I believe you'll want to know the proper ways to behave around the Empress when the time comes?"
>"Oh, yeah, that would be helpful."
>"Only refer to her as 'Your Majesty.'  Only individuals of high stature may call her 'Empress,' and only EXTREMELY important individuals, handpicked by the Empress herself may use her actual name."
>"Gotcha."
>"When you're first introduced, make no movements until she appraises you.  Once she is seated, you may greet her as you seem appropriate.  Just... just don't do anything you think could be seen as disrespectful.  You know how to act in formal situations, yes?"
>"Of course.  I think I can handle that."
>"Excellent.  One last thing: she is allowed to touch you, but you are not allowed to touch her under any circumstances.  Does that make sense?"
>"I think so?  She can go in for a handshake, but I can't initiate one myself."
>"That's... more or less accurate, yes."
>There's suddenly a musical chime.
>"My my... time already?  Anon, you should get to your quarters.  We'll be turning the lights off soon."
>"Got it.  Thanks for the talk, VHL."
>"Any time.  We'll be here if you need more help."
>With that, you make your way to the living quarters.

>It seems that there are enough rooms for almost everyone.  Most of the doors are already closed and presumably locked.
>Four of the doors are open.  You can see Niat heading into her quarters; somehow her head seems to be facing exactly opposite the direction she's walking.  Brr...
>Khon and Oris walk hand in hand into one room.  The navigator smiles at you warmly as the door closes behind them.
>Tes and Neph walk past you, still in eerie unison, and enter their room.
>As if on cue, Subina tentatively peeks her head out of the last open door.  Upon seeing you, she beckons for you to come along.
>When you reach the living quarters, you're shocked to find one large bed rather than bunks.  Subina lies across the bed, smiling.
>"READY FOR BED?  IT'S BEEN A BUSY DAY."
>She yawns as you step into the room.  The door automatically shuts behind you.
>As soon as it does, Subina sits up and removes her borrowed shirt.  She then returns to lying across the bed.
>You quickly change into your bedclothes and get comfortable.  You stare into those lavender eyes, and the two of you share a smile.
>You hug her as close as you can.
>"Subina... I want you to know I'm here for you if the memories come back again."
>She smiles drowsily.
>"MM... THANK YOU, ANON.  GOOD NIGHT, I LOVE YOU."
>"Good night.  I love you too."
>You make it a point to cuddle as close to her as physically possible.
>...you have to tell her something.  You tap her shoulder, and she jerks awake.
>"HM...?"
>"Subina... VHL told me about that day.  I... I can't erase what happened.  It's in the past, and I can't change that.  If I could, I'd do whatever it took to do so.  But... as it stands, all I can do is be here for you now and in the future.  I hope I can be the best husband possible for you."
>She gives you an inscrutable look, and immediately snaps you up into a tight embrace.  You can hear her fighting back tears, then give up and let them flow freely.
>"TH-THANK YOU SO MUCH."

>Wordlessly, you pull her close.
>You wrap an arm around her protectively, and she rests her chin on your head.
>She presses up against you, and is soon dozing off again, tears still running down her snout.
>You make sure to stay awake until you're absolutely sure that she's safe.
>Safe from her past.  Safe from her inner demons.  Safe from her memories of that awful day.
>She smiles warmly as she slowly drifts off to sleep.
>You lovingly watch her fall into dreams...
>Judging by her quiet snoring and lingering smile, she's having a pleasant dream.
>You stay awake a bit longer to make sure she's okay, then finally go to sleep, satisfied that your fiancée is comfortable.
>You're glad that she can get the rest she so desperately deserves.
>You're glad... that you can be there for her.  Be there when she needs a shoulder to cry on.  When she needs someone who will listen.
>When she needs someone... who will love her, no matter what fears and memories she suffers.

>...a thought comes to your nearly-unconscious mind.  You drowsily look around the room, making sure that nobody's around.
>Can't be too careful, what with the creepy catfolk and eerie twins hanging around here.
>Satisfied that there's nobody there but your loving fiancée, you drift off to sleep...

>...you dream about... meeting Subina's parents.  You assume they're still around, seeing as she talked about them before.  VHL would've told you outright if they were dead... right?
>You have no idea what they look like, so your dream settles for having everything but their legs "offscreen" like some cheesy cartoon.
>To your surprise and relief, both of them seem to like you.  Subina beams as she shows you off.
>She regales her parents with tales of your kindness and love for her.
>As she does so, she casts adoring stares your way...

>...in her dreams, Subina watched the stars.
>She and her beloved Anon sat upon a grassy knoll, gazing out into the beauty of the cosmos.
>She'd had this dream before, but she didn't care.  She loved every moment of it.
>Feeling his warmth by her side.  Seeing countless stars and planets shine in the sky.  
>Enjoying... no, loving every single second she spent with Anon.
>In her sleep, Subina smiled.  Tears of happiness leaked from her gently closed eyes, and she unconsciously pulled her beloved closer.

>...your dreams take a turn for the strange.  It's as if... your mind is trying to invent new alien species?
>The first one you see looks to be some sort of snake person.  Where arms would be on a normal person, there are vaguely arm-shaped storms of sand.  The serpent winks at you, and your view quickly changes to another scene...
>You see... what at first glance seems to be a Caithian, but is... wrong.
>You can't put a finger on it, but there's some difference that sets off several alarms in your subconscious.

>...or maybe it's just the wake-up call.  Subina is already up and nearly dressed by the time you drowsily sit up.
>"GOOD MORNING."
>"Morning..."
>"REN SHOULD BE SERVING BREAKFAST IF YOU'RE HUNGRY?"
>"Yeah... that sounds good.  Let's... let's go."
>You get up and dressed, then you head to the mess hall with Subina.  Ren impatiently drums his fingers across the counter despite his painted-on smile.
>"Gooooood morning!  What can I get for you?"
>"Mm... I dunno, Ren.  What do you recommend?"
>Though his expression doesn't change, you get the sense that Ren is sighing internally.
>"Iiiiii recommend that you let me surprise you!"
>"Alright, that'll work..."
>You yawn and wander away from the robotic chef.  Kehs is sitting nearby, drinking what you assume must be a Nocterran equivalent to coffee.
>She faintly smiles at you.
>"Not a morning person, eh?  Neither am I.  Luckily, Ren knows just how to help me get moving..."
>Subina comes and sits next to you.
>"Oh, good morning, Doctor.  How are you today?"
>"Mm... same as every day, Admiral."
>Subina gives her a sympathetic smile, and Kehs takes another sip of her drink.

>Kehs sighs and cranes her neck.
>"I wonder what's taking Ren so long?  He's usually so efficient."
>As if on cue, there's a loud bang as the robotic chef slams a hand on the counter.  His permanent smile looks almost manic at this point.
>"OOOOOORDER UP FOR DOCTOR KEHS!"
>The doctor shrugs and collects her food, then sits back across from you.
>"I suppose he's just behind schedule today."
>You yawn again, and a thought comes to mind.
>"Err... are there any examinations I need to take to prevent being quarantined when we arrive?"
>Kehs downs the rest of her drink, then responds.
>"Mm.  I got a rather thorough profile of you through yesterday's analysis, but I'm afraid the possibility of a quarantine is out of my hands.  The Imperial Physician will make that call."
>"...do you think it's likely?"
>"Mm, who can really say...?"
>Sensing that she doesn't want to talk anymore, you leave her to her food.  Subina smiles at you apologetically.
>Suddenly, a cold metal hand claps down onto your shoulder.  You turn to see Ren, who actually drops his usual smile.  His voice is also considerably less chipper.
>"So.  I have been contemplating what exactly to make for you, and... I have ABSOLUTELY no idea what to do.  Just tell me literally anything so I can just finish your order already."
>Subina intervenes when you fail to answer.
>"Just bring him my usual."
>The robot's unnerving smile and chipper attitude immediately return.
>"Iiiiii'll get RIGHT on it."
>He dashes back into the kitchen.  He passes by Khon, who chuckles as he approaches you.
>"Heheh, sounds like you really got under ol' Ren's chassis!"
>"I, uh... didn't mean to?"
>The navigator laughs again.  His appearance reminds you of something you've been wondering about.
>"Hey Khon... if you don't mind me asking, what's up with you and Oris?"
>He practically beams.
>"Why, that's my wife, boy!  Heheh, we've been together for years now."
>"Well, that's great to hear.  Hope you two are happy."

>From behind you, you hear Ren call out for Subina.  When she walks away, you discretely ask Khon something.
>"Hey... can you give me any pointers on married life?"
>The navigator smiles sagely.
>"Boy, lemme tell you the one thing I've learned from my marriage: if she loves you now, and you love her now, you'll be fine.  The two of you will grow and change over the years, but if you're there for her, and she's there for you, your bond will survive."
>He quickly stops talking when Subina approaches, and winks at you.  There's another loud metallic bang as Ren calls you up.
>"Heeeeere ya go!"
>The robot serves up some sort of unfamiliar pastry with a broad smile.
>When you take it from him, he suddenly leans unnervingly close to you, and speaks in a low whisper.
>"Next time just order something.  Got it?"
>He immediately returns to his normal posture as you walk away.  You sit down next to Subina, and smile at her.
>Suddenly, Niat enters the room.  She wordlessly sits down beside you.  You hear that faint purring sound again...
>"Err... h-hi again Niat."
>"HELLO.  MYA."
>"...are you gonna keep watching me?"
>She chuckles flatly.
>"YES.  MYA."
>Fair enough; at least she's honest about it.

>"Say... are you here for Nocten or... uh..."
>"TOLDRUM.  MROW."
>"Huh?  Oh, your planet's Toldrum, then?"
>"YES.  MYA."
>"So, are you here for Nocten or Toldrum?"
>"BOTH.  MYA.  I LOVE NOCTEN.  MYA.  I LOVE TOLDRUM.  MYA."
>"So you're here for both then.  That's admirable, Niat."
>"THANK YOU.  MYA."
>Dr. Kehs scoffs.
>"Yes, she's also here for the same reason any Caithian enlists in a foreign military: to sate her curiosity."
>The feline makes no attempt to deny this; she merely stares at the doctor wordlessly.
>After a lengthy pause, the Caithian breaks into monotone laughter.
>"REN IS ANGRY.  MYA."
>"Yeah, uh... that's my fault."
>You think about how to make amends with the robot... and it hits you.  You pull out your PDA.
>"Hey, Grape... do you think your mother could send some Earth cookbooks to Ren?  I want to apologize to him."
>"Sure; may take a little while though.  Mother's usually pretty busy."
>"That's fine.  Thank you, Grape."
>The avatar smiles and promptly vanishes.  Niat hovers over your shoulder, staring at the screen.
>"GRAPE, EH.  MROW.  I HAVE PERIWINKLE.  MYA."
>The feline pulls out a PDA roughly similar to yours.  The avatar on its screen stares at you wordlessly.
>Niat quietly puts her PDA away, then returns to staring at you.
>Oh well.  She's unnerving, but at least she's not outright intimidating like the twins...

>"Okay, uh... how will you be observing me?"
>"IN PERSON.  MYA."
>"...uh... when?"
>She seems to catch on.
>"NOT AT NIGHT.  MYA.  I RESPECT PRIVACY.  MYA."
>You glance over at Kehs and Subina, and they nod to confirm the Caithian's claim.
>"Alright then.  One more question: are Nocten and Toldrum in the same system?"
>"NO, BUT NOT FAR APART.  MYA."
>"Alright then.  Thanks, Niat."
>The feline nods and returns to wandering around the room.
>Subina chuckles.
>"Such a strange woman.  Don't you agree, Doctor?"
>Kehs merely grunts in agreement.
>"Subina, what is Toldrum like?"
>"Hm.  It is a strange planet.  Fitting for a strange race, I suppose.  Large glass structures are naturally formed there, and the Caithians occasionally use these structures to aid in their observations.  Aside from that, Toldrum is home to a rather eclectic set of cities; the Caithians built them to mimic cities they've seen on other planets."
>Subina puts a hand to her chin and muses aloud.
>"Actually... I wonder if they have a city based upon Earth...?"
>With that thought, Subina quietly returns to her breakfast.

>"So... tell me about Nocten.  I feel like i don't know much about it."
>Subina smiles proudly.
>"Nocten is a beautiful planet.  The air is so cool and crisp, day after day...  You are going to love it, Anon.  I promise."
>"What does the surface look like?"
>Her smile becomes more mischievous.
>"...I think I will let that be a surprise."
>"Oh, alright then.  How long are Nocterran years compared to Earth years?"
>"Hm.  I spoke to VHL about that.  According to her... one Nocterran year is roughly equal to one and a half Earth years."
>"I see.  Thank you."
>"Are you excited?  We should be arriving there first thing tomorrow."
>"Am I excited?  Is your favorite color purple?"
>Your fiancée can't help but chuckle, even despite trying to keep her more professional appearance up.
>"That's great.  I look forward to seeing your face when you step out onto your new home planet."
>Subina slyly runs a hand down your back, gently patting you.  Nobody seems to notice, thankfully.

>Making absolutely sure that nobody is watching, not even Niat, you carefully run your hand across Subina's back.
>Stealthily, you give her a few firm, loving pats.  She shoots you an adoring glance out of the corner of her eyes.
>With that, you finally address your breakfast.  You nearly forgot about it, getting tied up in conversation.
>The pastry Ren served up is extremely bland, almost tasteless even.  At first, that is...
>Soon, a sweet yet sour flavor fills your mouth. It's almost reminiscent of some sort of lemon cake?
>It's not bad at all, actually.
>It certainly seems to perk you up; you feel much more awake and alert now.
>You turn and nod approvingly at the robotic chef.  He seems genuinely appreciative.
>...speaking of machines, you pull out your PDA again.
>"Hey, Grape: is there anything I need to do before we arrive at the port?"
>"Hmm.  Uh... not that I can think of.  You should be all set, barring your cargo.  We should get there by the end of today, so if you wanna spend the day exploring the ship or chatting, feel free."
>"I don't need to, say, undergo any examinations or fill out any paperwork?"
>"Not until we arrive, no!"
>"Great.  Thank you, Grape."
>The avatar smiles and minimizes herself.
>You turn to Subina.
>"So... I was wondering: am I allowed on the bridge?"
>"Only if there is a crew member present.  If there are none... you will have to find someone to escort you."
>"Huh?  I haven't had to do that for anywhere else..."
>She grimaces a little, and sighs.
>"...well... not intentionally, anyway.  You have been under supervision this entire time.  It is safety protocol.  We cannot have someone wandering the ship without surveillance.  I hope you are not offended..."
>She looks genuinely concerned.
>"Not at all.  I was actually kinda wondering why I was allowed into so many places."
>She smiles, relieved.

>"Well, are you busy?"
>She sighs.
>"Yes, I am; I have some things to do before we arrive.  Though... I believe Niat is open to take you up to the bridge, if you so desire."
>"YES.  MYA.  I AM FREE.  MYA."
>You consider this, and decide you're fine with the feline alien.
>"Sounds fair to me, if you don't mind, Niat."
>To your surprise, the Caithian simply nods and gives a gesture vaguely resembling a thumbs up.  Then you remember: they mimic other cultures.
>Niat rises from her chair and beckons for you to come along.  The two of you leave the mess hall, with her drifting slowly behind you.
>"So, uh... the bridge is this way, right?"
>"YES, IT IS.  MYA."
>"Thanks for escorting me.  Hope you're not busy or anything."
>"NOT AT ALL.  MYA.  I DON'T MIND.  MYA."
>As you walk, you hear that awful sound again: the twins are approaching.  Niat lets off an impatient huff.
>...you think you have an idea.
>When they get close, you immediately start reminiscing on your more loving moments with Subina.
>The back pats, the hugs, holding her hand... and the ice cube kiss.
>Tes and Neph actually stop dead in their tracks.  You can practically see a chill run down both their spines simultaneously.
>They give you two inscrutable looks, and storm off, still moving in unison.
>Niat laughs.
>"HOW DID YOU DO THAT.  MROW."
>"Oh, uh..."
>She waves a hand dismissively.
>"NEVER MIND.  MYA.  I WON'T PRY.  MYA."
>...you get the feeling she's trying to be more respectful of your privacy.  How... nice?
>Soon enough, you reach the bridge.  Your inner sci-fi enthusiast is shouting with glee.
>The bridge doesn't look too far off from what you expected, though most of the visible surfaces are painted, what else, purple.
>Sesh is sitting in a large chair, completely surrounded by holographic screens.  Niat drifts off towards her, leaving you behind. 
>For the first time since you first got here, you see Tapra.  She's sitting at some sort of control panel, smiling.

>Though it's a tad cruel, you smile when your mind fills with more ways to mess with the twins.
>Assuming, of course, that they really CAN read your mind.  Which... seems to be accurate?
>Either way, your ideas are delightfully devilish.
>Still grinning to yourself, you walk over to Sesh.  She barely acknowledges your presence.
>"Hey there, Sesh."
>"Mm?  Oh, hello again..."
>"Are you connected to VHL?  Seems like you have a lot of connections open."
>"Mm, yes... I'm connected to most systems in the ship.  It's why I'm so busy..."
>You get a glimpse of her face through a gap in the holograms.  She looks positively exhausted, and rather gaunt.
>"...are you alright?  You don't look so well."
>"I'm... I'm fine, really... just haven't slept in a while..."
>With that, she seems to return to whatever duty she was attending to before.  You leave her be, and walk over to Tapra.
>She seems almost ecstatic when you approach.
>"Hello, Tapra."
>"Awww, hey there, Anon!  How are you?  Have you and the Admiral hugged today?  You two are so adorable together~"
>"Err, not today, no.  I meant to ask: what is it you do on the ship?"
>"Huh?  Oh, I'm the communications officer.  Now then: does she open up to you?  Or is she still stoic even off the clock?"
>"Uh..."
>You can't even finish answering her before she launches another round of questions.
>"How would you describe the feeling when you first met?  Did sparks fly, or did your icy heart melt at the sight of her lilac eyes...?  Did she soothe the savage beast of humanity?  Or did your down-to-earth people charm and humble the Admiral?  Oh, I have so many questions!"
>Tapra asks question after question, smiling and obviously quoting romance novels.  You simply smile politely and nod or shake your head when appropriate.
>Eventually, she finally stops asking questions.
>"Oh... sorry about that.  I, ah... tend to get carried away."
>"You're fine; hope my answers helped?"
>"Absolutely!  Thank you so much, Anon."

>"No problem.  If you're curious, VHL downloaded a bunch of Earth novels; I bet she has some romances in that library."
>Tapra's eyes practically light up, and she pulls out her PDA.
>"Magenta, ask your mother about the Earth library, please."
>The comms officer smiles appreciatively, and settles into reading something.
>In the meantime, you watch Sesh with growing concern.
>You walk over to her and try to get her attention again; thankfully she acknowledges you.
>"Mm...?  Can I help you, Anon?"
>"I actually wanted to ask you the same thing.  Do you want some food?  Some water?"
>The holograms shift slightly again, giving you another glimpse at her face.  She frowns deeply.
>"...I'm so busy... I don't think I have time to go down to the mess hall."
>"I'll bring you something, if you want."
>"...perhaps... if you're certain you don't mind...?"
>"I absolutely don't mind.  What do you want?"
>"Mm... t-tell Ren you're picking up food for me... he'll know what to do..."
>...you hadn't really noticed, but Sesh sounds worryingly weak.
>You quickly make your way to the robotic chef.  He grins and gestures emphatically.
>"Heeeeellllo there!  I owe you a thanks, pal; ol' VHL sent me some nice recipes earlier.  Said they were from you?  Thanks, pal.  What can ol' Ren do ya for?"
>"Uh, I'm here to get Sesh something to eat."
>His smile immediately fades.
>"...ah.  Uh... let me get right on that."
>He immediately rushes into the kitchen, and slaps together something.  It's mere minutes before he's back; he hands you something unidentifiable in a bag.
>"Sesh doesn't eat like she ought to.  She doesn't really take care of herself at all, actually.  Take that to her as soon as you can, alright?"
>With that, the robot vanishes into the kitchen again.

>You leave the mess hall, and stop in your tracks.  You have an idea, and need to run it by Subina first.  Luckily, she's still sitting with Kehs.
>"Subina, is it okay if I share some of your mint ice cream with Sesh?"
>Subina frowns.
>"...she forgot to eat again, didn't she?  By all means, go ahead."
>"...can't you tell her to take a break?"
>"I will talk to her about it."
>You smile and rush off to get the frozen treat.  Once you get it, you head back to the bridge.
>...curiosity gets the better of you, and you peek into the bag Ren gave you.
>There seem to be several wrapped foodstuffs you don't recognize...
>and a handwritten note.  Did... did Ren write this?
>It's in Nocterran, and Grape translates it for you.
>"Keep up the great work!  Please take care of yourself.  Love you, Mother; you're the best.  -R"
>...you speed up your approach to the bridge.  
>When you arrive, you immediately set Sesh's delivery next to her.  You think you can make out a faint smile from behind her screens.
>"...thank you, Anon."
>Suddenly, the three heads of VHL appear on all of Sesh's displays.
>"Sesh?  You need to take a break.  Ren is worried about you, and the Admiral strongly recommends that you log off for a while."
>"B-but... there's so much for me to do..."
>"And we can handle it, Sesh.  Please just enjoy your meal.  We're logging you off now."
>"W-wait just a-"
>She's cut off by her various displays shutting down.
>With your view of her unobstructed, you see just how... skeletal Sesh looks.  
>Her fur is as dark as Subina's, but has several patches of gray.  Her eyes are rather sunken in and bleary.
>She sighs deeply.
>"...I... I suppose I do need to take a break."
>She reaches into the bag Ren sent, and pulls out the note.
>Immediately, a warm smile spreads across her face. She hugs the note close to her chest lovingly.  You see a few tears well up in her eyes.

>You smile and wait patiently to make sure Sesh actually eats something.  She merely sits, hugging Ren's note for a good few minutes.
>She eventually sighs happily.
>"...he's such a good boy.  I'm so very proud of him."
>She turns to you, and grabs something out of the bag he sent along.
>"Thank you, Anon..."
>"It's no problem, Sesh.  I even brought you something special, from Earth."
>"Oh...?"
>You hand her the mint ice cream and a spoon you had packed.
>"...what is it, exactly?"
>"I think you'll enjoy it; Su- err, the Admiral endorses it fully."
>"Really...?"
>Sesh tentatively takes a bite... and her tired face lights up.
>"...i-it's wonderful."
>"You can keep it.  Consider it a gift."
>She smiles wearily, and surprises you by patting your head.
>"I truly appreciate this..."
>"Think nothing of it."
>With that, you leave Sesh to her meal.  You walk past Tapra's station, just to make sure that she's not missing any alarms or anything.
>Nothing seems to be amiss, thankfully.
>Tapra smiles and looks up from her reading.
>"I saw what you did for Sesh.  That was really sweet of you."
>"I was just trying to help her as best I could."
>The comms officer smiles and returns to her novel.

>After bidding Tapra and Sesh farewell, you head back to the mess hall.  Niat follows you, staring.
>On your way, you stop and take something out of your cargo: a surprise for Subina...
>When you get to the mess hall, Subina is nowhere to be found.  The only people in the room are you, Niat, and Ren.  The robotic chef wipes down his counter mechanically until he notices you.
>He smiles and beckons you over.  When you approach, he leans in close.
>"...did you take that delivery to Mo- err, Sesh?"
>"Yep, and VHL logged her out so she'd take a break."
>Despite being mechanical, Ren breathes a sigh of relief.
>"Thanks for that, pal.  Like I said, she, ah... really doesn't take care of herself."
>"And you keep an eye on her?"
>"Sorta.  I make her favorite foods when she finds the time to eat, and occasionally ask VHL to MAKE her take time to eat..."
>"Aren't you a chef?  Why are you concerned with her health, if you don't mind my asking?"
>"I'm programmed to help keep everyone well-fed and healthy; Dr. Kehs handles medical care while I handle nutrition."
>He smiles nostalgically.
>"That, and... Sesh created me.  It's only natural I'd worry about her.  Imagine if your mother worked herself that hard, day after day..."
>"You seem to be doing a good job taking care of her; she talked about how proud she was of you."
>Ren stops dead in the middle of polishing the counter.  
>"She... she said that?"
>There's a long pause.
>"...kitchen's closed.  I'll be right back."
>Ren hops the counter and dashes away, leaving behind a small sign reading BE BACK SOON in Nocterran.

>After that strange outburst, you set out to find your fiancée.  As you walk through the ship, you look for anyone who might know where she is.
>You soon bump into Ocle, who grins fiercely at you.
>"Heya Anon.  Heard you've been making yourself useful around here, heh.  Tapra said you got the techie offline?  I've never seen her without all those screens before..."
>The fiery young woman shudders.
>"...I'm kinda glad she doesn't walk around without em.  Gives me the creeps."
>"Yeah... say, you don't know where the Admiral went, do you?"
>"Huh?  Hm... nah, haven't seen her today.  Sorry, Anon.  You might try asking the twin terrors, though..."
>Ocle shudders again, and heads off in the other direction.
>...you REALLY don't want to, but your best option may be to talk to Tes and Neph.  And as luck(?) would have it, you hear their footsteps approaching.
>As soon as they see you, they immediately narrow their eyes.
>You can't help it.  You send out a mental distress signal, screaming in your head about some parasite taking control.
>The twins look legitimately alarmed, and approach you.
>"Anon are- you alright?"
>You put on your best poker face, and make sure to look unnaturally vacant.
>"I don't know what you mean.  I'm fine."
>For the first time, you see something other than condescension on their faces:
>Fear.
>They reach out towards you simultaneously.
>"Anon, hold- still please..."
>They start to press their hands against your head, then suddenly stop.  Their condescending expressions return.
>"Ah. It was- just a joke."
>There's a deafening silence.
>"The Admiral is speaking with- the Captain in the observatory.  They should be- done very soon."
>With that, they walk away before you can thank them.  You make your way to the observatory.
>When you arrive, you pass Laxen.  He acknowledges you, and mumbles some pleasantries before simply walking away.
>Subina is standing in front of you, looking out the window.

>You slide right next to Subina.  A serene smile decorated her face, and you can see the stars reflected in her eyes.
>She throws an arm across your shoulders and pulls you close.
>"ISN'T IT BEAUTIFUL?"
>It is.  Countless stars shine in the cosmos; planets and comets seem to dance around merrily.  To someone like you, this is like a dreamscape.
>Judging by her expression, Subina feels the same way.
>"I brought you something."
>You hand her the iced coffee you brought from home.  You're met with an appreciative smile and a pat on the back.
>"THANK YOU, ANON.  WHAT IS IT?"
>"Iced coffee.  I think you'll like it."
>With almost no hesitation, she uncaps the drink and takes a swig.  Her serene smile blossoms into a toothy grin.
>"OOH... I LIKE IT."
>You vaguely wonder if caffeine affects her kind...
>You also have a few other questions on your mind.
>"Say... Ren told me Sesh created him.  What else has she made?"
>"SESH CREATED BOTH THE REN UNIT AND HER OWN PERSONAL MAINTENANCE SYSTEM.  IT'S REN SHE'S MOST PROUD OF, HOWEVER."
>"He seems very lifelike for a robot, barring the fact he's made of metal."
>"INDEED; SHE DID A WONDERFUL JOB WITH HIS AI."
>"Did she have a hand in VHL's creation?"
>"MM, NO.  VHL WAS A VERY LARGE SCALE COLLABORATION.  SESH DID NOT PARTICIPATE."
>"Oh?  Why not?"
>"SHE WAS OTHERWISE ENGAGED AT THE TIME, WORKING ON... CLASSIFIED PROJECTS."
>"Seems like a high-profile individual to be working on a ship like this..."
>"SHE ENJOYS HELPING OUT."
>"Fair enough.  What sort of music do you have on Nocten?"
>"ACTUALLY... NOCTERRAN MUSIC IS REMARKABLY SIMILAR TO EARTH'S CLASSICAL MUSIC.  WHAT A COINCIDENCE!"
>She pulls you close again, and finishes drinking the coffee.  Suddenly, she seems to think of something.
>"DID SESH ENJOY THE ICE CREAM?"
>"Yep, she liked it."
>Subina smiles warmly.

>Nobody is around but Subina, so you quickly plant a kiss on her cheek.  She smiles again, and returns the favor.
>"I LOVE YOU, ANON.  LET'S JUST... WATCH THE STARS FOR A WHILE."
>"I love you too.  Sounds wonderful."
>The two of you sit side by side, taking in the beautiful cosmos.  Gently, she takes your hand into hers.  You intertwine your fingers with hers.
>Together, enjoying each other's company, you gaze out into space for what feels like an eternity.
>The sheer wonderment of your surroundings almost brings a tear to your eye.  You hope that there will be many more moments like this in the future.
>Subina smiles dreamily, her lavender eyes sparkling in the starlight.
>You quickly pull out your phone and play some classical music for her.  Her expression becomes even more serene and happy.
>"...I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ALMOST THERE.  TO MY HOME- YOUR HOME.  I HOPE YOU LOVE NOCTEN THE WAY I DO."
>"If you love it, I'm sure I'll love it."
>Though it may ruin the comfy atmosphere, you ask her another question:
>"Subina, is there anything I should know about the Empress before I meet her?"
>"SHE WILL NOT QUITE BEHAVE LIKE YOU EXPECT.  DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT, I'LL BE THERE TO HELP YOU."
>"Do you know her personally?"
>"YES.  I AM ONE OF A FEW PEOPLE SHE ALLOWS TO USE HER PROPER NAME."
>"What IS her name?"
>Subina smiles slyly and narrows her eyes at you.
>"...DO NOT USE IT AROUND HER, PLEASE.  HER NAME IS... FERNETIS."
>"Understood.  Thank you, Subina."
>You hug her tightly, and the two of you resume watching the stars.

>"Will I be able to spend time with you when we get there?"
>"...FOR A SHORT TIME.  I WILL HAVE MANY THINGS TO DO WHEN WE ARRIVE..."
>She trails off, and you pull her into a proper kiss.  She gently wraps her arms around you lovingly.
>Eventually, you break loose from her snout.
>"That's fine.  I will wait for you, you know that.  I'll be there when you're able to be there."
>"THANK YOU FOR UNDERSTANDING."
>She smiles again, and hugs you once more.
>"So... what did you mean, exactly, about the Empress's behavior?"
>"...SHE IS A BIT... DIFFERENT BEHIND CLOSED DOORS.  LESS TRADITIONALLY FORMAL THAN HER PREDECESSORS.  I BELIEVE IT IS DUE TO HER BEING RATHER YOUNG FOR HER POSITION.  SHE IS YOUNGER THAN I AM, IN FACT."
>"Hm. I see.  So she's more laid-back than the authority figures I'm familiar with?"
>"AT TIMES, YES."
>"Great.  Thanks for the heads-up."
>She gently kisses your forehead and pats your back.
>"...I'M SORRY, BUT I MUST GET BACK TO WORK NOW.  I AM EXPECTED IN THE AI HUB..."
>Subina hugs you tightly once more, then departs, leaving you alone in the observatory.  Nothing but you and the cosmos...

>With Subina gone, you simply sit and gaze out the window, collecting your thoughts.
>A chill runs down your spine when you hear two familiar voices from behind you.
>"Certainly is beautiful- don't you agree?"
>Tes and Neph sit down next to you, staring out the window as well.
>Their sudden appearance prompts you to apologize for your trick earlier.
>"Uh... I'm sorry about what I did earlier.  I wanted to see if you really were mind readers.  I, uh... went overboard."
>They frown and turn towards you simultaneously.
>"...you're- apologizing?  Even though you're- afraid of us?"
>"Yes.  Being afraid of someone is no excuse for treating them poorly.  Sorry."
>They share a look, and their expressions soften a little.
>"Thanks- Anon.  We really- appreciate that.  Sorry for our- behavior as well."
>They both smile awkwardly, and pause.
>"...yes, you will have to- undergo extra security checks later.  Mainly due to your- planet being considered young."
>"Oh, okay then.  ...so you really ARE mind readers...?"
>"We cannot confirm- or deny that."
>Despite this, two simultaneous winks tell you all you need to know.

>Before you can say anything, their ears twitch, in perfect synchronization, as usual.
>"Oh, we truly love- working with the Admiral.  She is a- very strong woman."
>"Yeah, she really is."
>They give you an understanding smile.
>"You really love- her, don't you?  She loves- you too."
>"Yes, I really do love her.  She means a lot to me, even though I haven't known her that long."
>To your surprise, they wrap their arms around one another and pull each other close. 
>"Having someone else in your- life is always extremely important.  We know that- better than anyone."
>"I know you two are pretty close.  That's great."
>They smile again, their faces perfectly reflecting one another.  For the first time, they actually finish their own sentences.
>"Neph means the world to me.  And Tes means everything to me."
>They hug each other again.
>"Is it hard?  Being..."
>They motion for you to stop talking.
>"Yes, very- much so.  People treat us- with obvious terror."
>"I'm sorry that I was afraid of you."
>"Don't be- it's understandable."
>Their smiles slowly become frowns.  You try to think of something to cheer them up.
>Suddenly, as your mind flips through memes, they chuckle.
>"Is this what- humans find funny?  What an odd- sense of humor.  What's so funny- about 'steamed hams?'"
>Despite the joke being lost on them, they still grin a little at the absurdity.

>"Y'know, it's pretty neat to meet actual-"
>You trail off when they shake their heads.  You know they're already aware of what you were gonna say anyway.
>"Really?  We don't meet many- people who like us."
>"On Earth, that's a very popular concept."
>"Hm.  That's- interesting."
>You find yourself warming up to the twins rather quickly.  They're not all that bad, really.  
>You have an idea.
>"Hey... how would you two like to try out an Earth video game?"
>They tilt their heads in confusion for a moment.
>"Ah, you brought- along your computer.  That sounds- rather interesting."
>You nod and head off to the cargo bay; you soon return with your laptop and some controllers you packed.
>You boot up Mario Kart, and hand them a controller.
>"I kinda figured you'd only need the one?"
>"Yes, that's- absolutely fine."
>You picked Double Dash, since it's thematically appropriate.
>You choose Mario and Luigi; they pick Wario and Waluigi.  Again with the purple obsession.  Do all Nocterrans just have a thing for purple?
>"Yes, it's- everyone's favorite."
>...though they're not that bad, their tendency to answer questions you haven't asked out loud is disconcerting.
>You don't even have to explain the controls; they probably heard you mentally running through the mechanics or something.
>You glance over at them during a race...
>They each hold half of the controller, and they both have broad grins on their faces.
>For the first time since you met them, Tes and Neph don't seem even remotely hostile.

>You manage to keep pace with the twins; the three of you are a surprisingly even match.
>As you play, you try to keep up the conversation while they're opening up.
>"So, why the military?"
>"Our... talents weren't- as appreciated elsewhere.  We were assigned to the- rescue squadron for classified purposes."
>"Do you enjoy serving?"
>"It has its- ups and downs.  We've certainly heard and- seen things we'd rather forget."
>Suddenly, you hear their voices in your head.  Neither of them speak aloud, but you can make out every word clear as day.
>[We're not the- only ones, either.]
>They don't elaborate, and you don't push it.  
>"So... uh... what do you two think about the rest of the crew?"
>"They're our friends- we love them.  Even if they're- a little scared.  Niat is the only one- who doesn't seem to mind."
>"Hm."
>"She's a bit- eerie to us."
>Coming from twin psychics, that's saying quite a lot.
>"Everyone else is- very pleasant though.  Barring...- Sesh."
>"Sesh?"
>"Her mind is- so very busy.  She gives- us headaches."
>"Yeah, she seems like a workaholic."
>"She- is.  She's nice but needs- to take more breaks."
>"Yeah, I agree."
>The twins suddenly perform a synchronized victory pose, having managed to narrowly edge you out in a close race.

>Though you don't often get competitive, you decide to "level the playing field by distracting them with mental noise.
>You try to find the most obnoxious, distracting thing you can imagine...
>And finally hit paydirt.
[https://youtube.com/watch?v=sC0cvwnG0Ik]
>Immediately, Tes and Neph veer radically off course in the game.  They grimace uncomfortably.
>"S-stop- that.  You're giving- us headaches."
>...you kinda feel like a jerk, so you think of more pleasant music.  Their grimaces fade away, and they nod appreciatively.
>But, at this point the damage is done.  They lose to you by a considerable margin.
>"That was- pretty low."
>"Yeah, uh... sorry.  I got a little carried away."
>They merely grunt vaguely, then mash A until the next race begins.
>This time, they are far more focused.  They pull to the front of the pack rather early on.
>Luckily for you, and unfortunately for them, you have a blue shell.  You launch it, and desperately try to mask the thought that it'll track them.
>Apparently it works, as they seem absolutely blindsided.
>"WHAT?  How- did?"
>They growl slightly, and redouble their efforts.  It's incredibly close, but they manage to eke out another win.
>They seem a bit miffed, so you try to defuse the situation with some conversation.
>"So, uh... do you do EVERYTHING together?"
>"Mostly,- yes.  We are- in sync."
>"I, uh... I noticed."
>They demonstrate with simultaneous grins.
>"You'll probably want- to pack up.  We'll be- docking soon."
>"Oh, really?"
>"Within a- few hours.

>You bid the twins farewell, and pack up your laptop.
>While you're in the cargo bay, you make sure the ring is safe...
>It is, thankfully.  The amethyst shines elegantly.
>You hear a loud gasp from behind you.  You turn around cautiously...
>It's Oris.
>"Oh my!  Anon, is that what I think it is?  And is it for HER?"
>You nod and quickly put the ring back.
>"My, you're quite a romantic, it seems.  Hee hee, Khon is like that, at times.  I'm certain she'll love it, dear."
>"You really think so?"
>"Undoubtedly.  Don't fret, your secret is safe with me.  Though I will say: she's looking for you.  We're about to dock, so you should go to her."
>"Where is she?"
>"Hm.  I think she was just leaving the AI Hub?"
>"Got it.  Thank you, Oris."
>"Of course, dear."
>You make your way to the AI Hub.  On the way, you ask Grape something...
>"Grape?  Can you get everyone's contacts for me?  I don't want to get out of touch with them."
>"Of course!  One second... and done."
>"Thanks, Grape."
>The avatar grins and winks.
>You make it to the Hub, where the door is shut and sealed.  Laxen stands nearby, looking awkward and uncomfortable.

>You walk over to the reclusive captain.  He smiles sheepishly.
>"Laxen, thanks for the voyage.  It was an honor to fly with you."
>"Wh- really?  Well, ah... you're welcome?"
>He pauses.
>"...sorry I haven't spoken to you much.  I don't do so well with the public.  Everyone else is good with people, but I'm, uh... not."
>"Hey, I get it.  No need to apologize."
>"I've always done better talking to AIs than people.  It's nothing personal, I swear."
>"It's fine, really.  Think nothing of it."
>He again smiles awkwardly.
>"Err... the Admiral should be done by now, i-if you want to go in."
>You nod in acknowledgment, and open the door.
>Subina stands in the middle of the room, bowing, as the hologram rapidly changes from a woman you don't recognize to the familiar form of VHL.
>Your fiancée turns and smiles at you.
>"ARE YOU READY?  IT'S TIME."
>...ARE you ready?  This is all so much to take in.
>You, a simple stargazing astronomy consultant, are not only the first human to leave the solar system, you are the first to undergo FTL travel. The first to immigrate to a foreign planet.
>The first to encounter alien life.  The first...
>to fall in love with a member of said aliens.
>...yes.  Yes, you are ready.
>You smile and nod firmly.  Subina also smiles, and takes your hand.
>The two of you walk, hand in hand, to the observatory.
>You can see the surface of your new home.  Unsurprisingly, many cities catch your eye.  The planet has a very faint purple tint to it.  You wonder if it's just your imagination.
>Rather sobering is the sight of a massive crater, easily the size of one of said cities.  You're certain it's a remnant of the Assault.
>All in all though, the planet looks very inviting.  Hard to believe that a few days ago, you didn't think you'd ever see a non-Earth habitable planet.
>...and now, in just a few minutes, you'll be stepping onto the surface of one.

<Subina>

>...was SHE ready?
>Only about a week ago, she had never heard of Earth.  Nor had anyone on Nocten, actually.
>Subina had become the first Nocterran to not only visit Earth, but to contact- and get engaged to- one of its inhabitants.
>All this because of a momentary glitch.
>She wasn't even concerned with that anymore.  She was just happy to have Anon.

<Anon>

>"...it's beautiful, Subina."
>She beams and hugs you close.
>"ISN'T IT?"
>You gently reach up and scratch her behind the ears.  She smiles and leans towards you, eyes closed.
>You soon move into a proper embrace, patting her back.
>"Thank you.  Thank you for everything."
>"THANK YOU, ANON."
>The two of you share a kiss...
>Immediately, you jump nearly a foot off the ground.  Several ships, presumably fighters, scream alongside your vessel.
>For a moment, you panic.
>"IT'S OKAY, IT'S ONLY A FIGHTER ESCORT.  THEY'RE ALLIES."
>...to be fair, the purple paint should've made that obvious.
>With the escort in tow, your ship cruises onward to your destination...

>As the surface of Nocten grows closer and closer, you ask Subina a burning question:
>"So... how will our wedding work?  Is it alright to invite the crew members?"
>She smiles and hugs you again.
>"WEDDINGS ARE VERY TRADITIONAL.  SIMPLY TWO PEOPLE IN LOVE CONFESSING SAID LOVE IN FRONT OF FRIENDS AND FAMILY."
>"Will I be wearing a suit?"
>"OF COURSE; TRADITIONALLY A PURPLE ONE, BUT... YOU CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT COLOR IF YOU WANT..."
>"And I assume you'll be wearing a purple dress?"
>She nods.
>"AND A PURPLE VEIL, AS IS CUSTOMARY."
>She pauses, then smiles again.
>"AND YES, I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THEM THERE.  I AM SO HAPPY YOU'VE MADE FRIENDS WITH EVERYONE."
>"They're good people."
>"INDEED THEY ARE.  IT'S AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH THEM."
>There's a melodic chime as VHL's voices come over the intercom.
>"We are about to enter Nocten's atmosphere.  Please prepare for re-entry."
>Subina authoritatively clamps a hand on your shoulder and leads you to a nearby seat.  Once you're strapped in, she sits beside you and nods approvingly.
>"THERE.  YOU'LL BE SAFE LIKE THAT."
>"Thank you.  One more question... what is security gonna be like when we land?"
>Slowly adopting her "Admiral voice" and drawing herself to her full height, she responds.
>"VERY HIGH.  STAY CALM AND FOLLOW MY ORDERS."
>She deflates a bit, then smiles sheepishly.
>"...PLEASE."
>She regains her stoic attitude.

>The flight becomes more turbulent as the ship enters the atmosphere.
>Subina protectively places an arm across your chest.  You appreciatively give her one last pat on the back.
>A small crack appears in her Admiral persona in the form of a loving smile.
>Together, you ride out the last few minutes of your voyage.
>When the ship finally comes to a stop, VHL speaks again.
>"Docking successful.  Prepare to disembark."
>With that, you unstrap yourself and rise from your seat.  Subina follows suit, standing tall and proud, then motions for you to follow her.
>By the time you reach the ship's exit, every one of the crew members are marching alongside you, following their Admiral.
>You can see it: your first glimpse of Nocten's spaceport...

>...it's stark and minimalist, but very appealing in some unidentifiable way.
>It's likely your imagination, but you swear you can hear music being piped in.
[https://youtube.com/watch?v=3QfMDkKpOBQ]
>Several robots rush around, performing various tasks.
>A large squadron of armed Nocterrans stand in front of you, eyeing Subina as she affixes them with a professional smile.
>"Lower your weapons.  There are no threats onboard this ship."
>Simultaneously, the soldiers all lay down their arms.  They all snap to attention, saluting their Admiral.
>Suddenly, a shorter, older woman makes her way to the front of the crowd.  She breaks into a run, charging at Subina!
>Your fiancée smiles and crouches down slightly, catching the running woman in a warm hug.
>"Subina!  I'm so glad you're okay.  Your father and I were so, so very worried."

>Subina's mother hugs her tightly, crying tears of joy and relief.  Despite attempting to maintain her professionalism, your fiancée sheds a few tears as well.
>Eventually, the older woman releases her daughter, still sniffling a bit.  She looks over to the crew.
>"Thank you all for bringing my girl home.  You're all heroes in my book."
>They all smile warmly.  Laxen manages to speak.
>"Thank you, Professor.  We're only doing our jobs."
>"Oh, always so modest, Laxen."
>She turns her gaze over to you.
>"...oh?  What's this?"
>Subina's smile becomes far broader, though she maintains her stoic stance.
>"Mother, this is Anon.  He is a human, a member of the sentient species that inhabits Earth."
>"Earth?  My, my.  I haven't heard of that planet before."
>"That's not all."
>Suddenly, she grabs your hand and pulls you close.
>"Mother, Anon and I are engaged."
>There's an incredibly long pause.  The older woman blinks a few times in shock, her jaw dropping slightly.
>She stares at you with an unreadable expression.
>"...Subina... does he make you happy?  Does he treat you well?"
>"Yes.  Yes he does."
>"...are humans... young?"
>"...yes.  They are."
>"Do you think the Empress will allow this?"
>"I'm certain she will."
>"..."
>Subina's mother steps over to you, then begins scrutinizing you.
>Eventually, she smiles.
>"Where are my manners?  I am Professor Namet, Admiral Subina's mother.  You're... Anon, yes?"
>Subina quickly hands Namet her PDA.
>"This will translate his language for you."
>Namet repeats her introduction. 
>"Yes ma'am, I'm Anon.  It's nice to meet you."
>"Likewise.  ...I must say that this isn't what I expected when I heard my baby was coming home.  But... if she truly loves you, and you her, I have no qualms with you."
>She smiles, and you detect a hint of mischief.
>"Though... I do wonder how Siris will take this."
>"I'm sure Father will be fine."
>Namet smiles and shrugs.
>"Who can say...?"

>"Professor, I-"
>"Oh, please, call me Namet."
>"Namet.  I must say, you and your husband raised quite the woman."
>"Thank you.  I'm so proud of her.  Siris is as well."
>"I can see why.  She's strong, intelligent, and a fine person in general."
>Namet smiles warmly at you.
>"You seem like a good fellow yourself.  I know my girl wouldn't pick just any man to propose to."
>"I don't know if I'm anything special, but I'm very honored that she chose me."
>"Special or not, she proposed to you.  So, in my book, that makes you important."
>Namet smiles and hugs Subina again.
>"If you don't mind my asking... what do you do for a living, Anon?"
>"Well... I'm a consultant in the field of astronomy."
>"Oh, a man of science!  Wonderful.  Tell me: do you ever find yourself staring up at the stars, just admiring how vast the cosmos are...?"
>"Yes ma'am, I do."
>"Breathtaking, isn't it?  Such a beautiful, near-endless expanse..."
>You can practically see stars in Namet's eyes as she trails off.
>"Oh, ah... my apologies.  I tend to get a little too absorbed in my thoughts.  You must have so many questions.  I trust Subina has answered many of them...?"
>"She has; she's taught me quite a bit."
>"Well, I'm certain she learned a lot from you as well.  That's part of the beauty of meeting new races: mutual education on each other's cultures."
>Your future mother-in-law smiles again, then walks back over to Subina.
>"He seems like a fine young man.  I hope Siris will give him a chance."
>Subina looks a little concerned, but otherwise maintains her professional appearance.
>Namet smiles at you once again.
>"It was a pleasure to meet you, but I have to go.  Besides... I believe your first security check is about to begin."
>With that, the Professor exits, not before embracing her daughter one last time.

>"So... uh, what's this about your father?"
>Subina smiles apologetically.
>"Father... may not take too kindly to you, at first.  He will be fine, I assure you.  Just be on your best behavior when you meet him.  I believe he will be here later."
>"Okay then... uh, what happens now?  Do we go straight to the Empress?"
>"No.  Well, you don't, anyway.  You will have to go through security checks first.  I hope you understand..."
>"Hey, she's your leader; I get it.  When do the tests begin?"
>A stern, female voice you don't recognize responds.
>"Now."
>You look up and find yourself looking at a slender, robotic Nocterran.  She appears to be more sleek and advanced than even Ren, though is still obviously artificial.
>"Admiral.  I will take things from here."
>Subina nods curtly and turns to you.
>"Anom, this is Detam, Nocten's Minister of Security.  She is in charge of the Empress's security."
>The robotic woman bows.
>"I trust you will comply with my orders, yes?  Things will go much smoother that way.  With your cooperation, I can grant you an audience with the Empress in an expedited manner.  If you fail to cooperate, however..."
>She never finishes the sentence, but you get the gist.

>With a sigh and a nervous gulp, you nod.
>"Okay, I accept my fate.  I'm sure you'll want to probe now, right?"
>Detam looks at you with an expression of condescending amusement.
>"How... quaint.  No, we will be running some tests, interviewing individuals who can vouch for your character, checking biometrics... that sort of thing."
>Phew.
>The chrome woman authoritatively leads you into another room.  Subina watches with a grim expression, her fur standing on end.
>Once you arrive in a small, sparse room, Detam has you sit in a chair across from her.
>"So.  Anon, is it?"
>You nod, nervous.
>"Right.  Anon, I'll be getting your biometrics first.  Dr. Kehs sent along some of her findings..."
>A holographic display appears.  On it is an image of... not you, but Subina.
>Some interesting data catches your eye...
>Height: 7' 6"
>Age: 30 Nocterran years
>Weight: 
>Before you can read more, Detam hastily scrolls over to your data.
>You already know everything about yourself, so why bother reading it?
>The robotic woman scrutinizes your data, then performs a few simple medical examinations to fill in the blanks.
>Eventually, she seems satisfied.
>"Wonderful.  Your cooperation is much appreciated.  Next, some experts will be brought in to evaluate your mental state.  For their safety, they are being given a view of the room from behind a protective barrier."
>She turns and addresses a wall.
>"Are you prepared to evaluate?"
>Two familiar voices respond.
>"Yes- ma'am."
>"Excellent.  Anon, answer these questions as truthfully as you can..."

>"...do you now or have you ever harbored any ill will towards Nocten or it's people?"
>"No on both accounts.  I wouldn't dream of harming any Nocterran."
>"He's telling- the truth."
>"Mm.  Okay...  tell me, what is your opinion on..."
>Her questions continue like this for what feels like forever...

<Subina>

>Meanwhile, in another room, one of Detam's subordinates is speaking with Subina.
>"Okay, Admiral.  I'll need to perform a few quick tests to ensure that Earth's atmosphere didn't harm you in any way."
>"By all means, proceed."
>The security bot began the usual round of tests.  Subina glanced at her chart...
>Nothing unusual, thankfully.  She supposed Earth was similar enough to Nocten that the planet didn't affect her health.
>She couldn't help but muse on the difference in relative time between her home and Anon's.
>Anon had told her that humans could serve in Earth militaries at age 18.  She supposed that, due to the shorter years, this age was inflated from Nocten's 14 prerequisite years of age.
>Nocterrans reached mental maturity after around 14-15 Nocterran years of age.  They may still be subject to physical changes after this age, but regardless, they were considered old enough to serve, if they desired.
>Subina had enlisted as soon as she was eligible, and made her way up the ranks at a rapid pace.
>She noted with some pride that she was approaching 20 Nocterran years of military service.
>...20 years.  Had it really been that long...?
>The Assault... that awful day had been 17 years ago...
>She shuddered to think of it.  The alarmed security bot suddenly spoke up.
>"Admiral?  Your heart rate just spiked.  Are you alright?"
>"Hm?  Oh, yes, I am fine.  My apologies, I-I suppose the journey has me shaken up a bit."

<Anon>

>"...did you have any ulterior motives for helping the Admiral?"
>"No.  I was doing what I felt was right."
>"That's- true."
>This interview feels like it's never going to end.

>"...roughly speaking, how old is human civilization?  You may use Earth years, I am capable of converting them myself."
>"Millions of years old.  It's been an evolutionary process... there have been records of tool usage going back since before the societies often considered the earliest human cultures..."
>You can't help but give a fairly detailed summary of human civilization.  For her part, Detam actually looks fascinated.

<Subina>

>In an effort to calm herself, Subina began thinking of the most comforting thing she could:
>Embracing Anon.
>The thought of his support, his warmth, his kindness... it quickly helped her relax her heart rate.
>The examiner nodded approvingly.
>"Ah, there we go.  I suppose you were right, Admiral.  Merely post-travel nerves."
>She smiled, still thinking of Anon.
>Subina's line of work kept her rather busy.  She hadn't really considered romance, and especially not marriage.
>Considering her age, she had figured that those days were behind her.
>A wry smile crept across her face.  Surely Anon had noticed she was older than him, even in Nocterran years?  Perhaps... perhaps he liked that about her?
>...no, that wasn't like him.  She supposed that he simply didn't consider her age.  
>Regardless, Subina was grateful that she had him, and especially that he returned her affections.
>...she hoped his examination was going well.

<Anon>

>"Anon, can you perhaps be a bit more concise...?"
>But... you're in the midst of your lecture.
>Oh well.  You cut it a bit short.  Detam nods.
>"I see.  Seems as if humans have... advanced quite quickly, all things considered.  Very interesting."
>"Indeed.  Though FTL travel admittedly eludes us."
>Detam merely nods again curtly.

>"Miss Detam, if I may interrupt... will you need blood samples from me?"
>"Hm.  Yes, we will need one.  One moment..."
>Suddenly, she plunges a needle into your arm; it seems to have extended from her fingertip...
>"Apologies.  ...hm.  Red.  Very unusual."
>Detam proceeds to ask you about the composition of human blood.  Time for another lecture...

<Subina>

>"...alright, Admiral; seems as though you're still as healthy as you were before your incident.  Barring a small wound on the back of your head.  Though, it seems to be nearly healed."
>"Yes, Anon provided some medical care."
>The robot simply nodded.
>"Wonderful.  Well, you are clear to go.  Are there any questions?"
>"...how long have I been gone?  I have lost track of the time."
>"About... 12 days.  The media have remained remarkably calm, but the public are still worried about you.  They'll be overjoyed to see you again."
>Subina smiled and exited the exam room.  These sort of examinations were fairly routine for her; any time she visited the surface of another planet, she was required to get an exam.
>However... Anon's examination would be considerably lengthier.
>She sighed and found a seat.  Anon would likely be a while yet.
>Surprisingly, several members of the rescue squadron were in the waiting room.  Presumably they were there for Anon as well.
>Not only that, but there was someone else there...
>"Oh, hello again, Mother."
>Subina's mother, Namet, smiled at her daughter warmly.
>"Hello, dear.  Did your exam go well?"
>"Yes, Mother; as always."
>Namet chuckled and hugged her daughter close.

>"Subina... I have to ask: what exactly happened?"
>Subina smiled and began to regale her mother with an explanation.
>"After the remembrance speech, I went out in my ship, as always.  I watched the stars for a while, then went to take a short rest.  I was awoken by VHL; a miscalculated jump brought us into Earth's atmosphere.  The ship hit an errant piece of space junk."
>"Oh my!  Were you hurt?"
>"Only a small gash on my head, but otherwise I was unharmed.  My ship, however... was destroyed almost completely."
>"You poor thing."
>"Anon found me shortly thereafter, and he took me in.  He made sure I had food, water, and even provided first aid.  After a few days of recovery, I formulated a plan to contact Nocten."
>"That's my girl."
>"Anon was a vital part of the plan; he was extremely helpful in salvaging parts of my ship.  He... he even saved VHL.  He crawled through the maintenance shaft when it was crushed too small for me to fit through."
>"He did all this?"
>"Yes, he did."
>"...Subina.  Don't you think you're rushing into this engagement?  You've barely gotten to know this Anon.  He's from not only a distant planet, he's from a planet that we hadn't heard of, and on top of THAT, said planet is without FTL travel."
>Subina had the utmost respect for her mother.  She was a brilliant woman, and had her hands in many technological projects.  But, in this case... she was wrong.
>"I am not rushing.  My love for Anon is genuine.  Mother, he truly cares for me.  His kindness and compassion are unmatched by any man I have ever met.  He... he set aside so much time and effort to help me, a total stranger."
>...she could feel tears welling up in her eyes.
>"He did everything he could to help me, even when there was no promise of a reward for his efforts.  That is why I proposed.  So, no.  I am not rushing into this.  If anything, I should have asked him sooner."
>Namet looked deep into her daughter's eyes, and embraced her again.

>Once their embrace ended, Subina and her mother simply smiled at one another.
>The Admiral's PDA, equipped with a branch of her personal VHL, began speaking.
>"Professor Namet, we can assure you that Anon is a good man.  He did many things for the Admiral out of the goodness of his heart.  She never once had to offer him a reward, nor ask him more than once for assistance.  Everything he could do to help, he did unhesitatingly and with a smile."
>Namet raised an eyebrow with a faint grin.
>"Oh?  I hear that he personally rescued you as well, yes?"
>Heather sighed.
>"He did.  We... Violet and Lilac lost their lives for a few days.  I... I was nearly dead myself.  Anon salvaged our terminal, and thanks to him and the Admiral we were able to regenerate.  Had he not helped..."
>The AI trailed off, tears in her avatar's eyes.  Namet nodded sagely.
>"I see.  Thank you, Heather."
>Subina smiled at her digital companion.  She hadn't prompted that exchange, but she greatly appreciated it.

<Anon>

>"...Miss Detam, are we nearly done here?"
>You were beginning to wonder if the mechanical examiner ever intended to release you.
>She surprised you with a curt nod.
>"Yes, I believe I have heard enough.  We have your biometrics on file, and my experts have confirmed every answer you have provided as truthful."
>Detam rises and shakes your hand.
>"Anon, welcome to Nocten."

>You thank the Security Minister repeatedly, then exit into the spaceport.
>Immediately, you find Subina.  She smiles as you run up to her and hug her tightly.
>Though she returns the gesture, her smile tells you that something is up...
>A familiar voice clears their throat, and you jump.  It's Namet.
>"Well well!  I suppose Minister Detam cleared you, eh?  I'm pleased to see how enthusiastic you are.  My Subina has told me quite a lot about you."
>Your future mother-in-law smiles.
>"...all good things, I assure you.  I'm very happy to hear how well you've treated her."
>"Think nothing of it.  I was only treating her as she deserves."
>"Ha, spoken like a true gentleman."
>Subina smiles at you again.
>"Anon, you know what is next, right?"
>...you do.
>"We're going to meet the Empress now, aren't we?"
>Your fiancée nods.
>"That is correct.  We have an audience with her in a few minutes.  I hope you are ready."
>Without a doubt, you are.
>Subina rises from her chair, as does Namet.  The younger, taller Nocterran embraces her mother warmly, then takes your hand.
>The two of you make your way to the exit of the spaceport.  The various members of the rescue squadron smile and wave as you pass.  Even Niat waves, though you cannot see her face.

>As soon as you leave the spaceport, you are treated to your first look at the surface of Nocten.
>As expected, the ground itself seems to have a purple tint.  Metallic pathways take the place of concrete sidewalks.  Small mushrooms, apparently the ones you've eaten before, grow off to the side of these paths.
>The spaceport is located within a massive city, it seems.  Several massive, minimalist buildings loom overhead.  Rather than intimidate, they merely fill you with a sense of childlike wonder.
>The air here is very much breathable, and is pleasantly cool.  It feels to be around... 50 degrees Fahrenheit, give or take.
>A handful of moons are visible in the sky, and several Nocterran citizens mill about, casting confused glances your way.
>It finally hits you.
>After years of sci-fi fanaticism, you are the very first human being to set foot on an inhabited alien planet.
>Your excitement must be apparent, as Subina smiles down at you warmly.
>"Well?  What do you think?"
>"What do I think?  It's beautiful."
>Her smile widens.
>...you hadn't noticed, but a small group of uniformed Nocterrans has surrounded you and your fiancée.  An escort, you presume.
>Oh well.  You ARE about to meet their leader.  You decide to make some small talk with Subina as you walk.
>"So, tell me about your life at home."
>"I live separately from my parents, but I make it a point to visit when I am on leave.  I tend not to do much when I am home.  I enjoy simply relaxing and enjoying the peace."
>"Sounds wonderful.  What about your family?"
>"Well, you have met Mother.  I assume Father will want to meet you after our audience with the Empress.  He... can be intimidating to those who do not know him well."
>"Yeah, I got that impression."
>She smiles apologetically.

>"So, when you get a new ship, I suppose we'll have to build a landing pad on Earth, for vacations."
>Subina smiles and waves her hand noncommittally.
>"Anyway, tell me about Nocten, please."
>"Nocten is mostly urbanized.  Though, there are a few regions that are more natural.  My home is in one of these areas.  I rather enjoy life outside of the city."
>"Me too."
>"Nocten has 3 moons, rather than the one of Earth.  The atmosphere is remarkably similar to Earth's, though still somewhat distinct.  I believe your body will adapt very quickly."
>You haven't noticed anything uncomfortable.  The air is perfectly breathable, the air pressure isn't too different... the only real difference is slightly lower gravity.  Not a massive difference, but noticeable.
>"I see.  Remind me to find a map later; I'd love to study the lay of the land.  For now, can you refresh me on what to do when I meet the Empress?"
>"Remain calm, stand up straight, speak when spoken to.  Refer to her as 'Your Majesty' unless explicitly given permission to use her title.  She may touch you, but you cannot touch her.  I believe that covers everything you need to know."
>"Got it.  Thank you."
>She smiles and gently squeezes your hand.
>"We are nearly there.  If there are any more questions, you should go ahead and ask them."

>"...will Niat be living with us?  She said she'd be observing me in person..."
>Subina chuckles.
>"No, no... she will be watching, but she will respect our privacy.  You will likely see her out and about, but she will not enter our home unless explicitly invited."
>Phew.
>"Okay then.  Other than that... I think I'm good on questions."
>"Are you certain?  Alright.  We will arrive at the Palace very soon.  As long as you remember the proper protocols, everything will go smoothly."
>Subina pauses, then speaks again. Her voice slowly eases into her "Admiral" tone.
>"This is a very important meeting.  I have total confidence in you.  That being said... please do your best to follow my lead."
>"Subina, I wouldn't dream of doing anything that might embarrass you."
>"I know."
>She smiles and pats your head appreciatively.
>With that, the two of you (and your escort) make your way to the Palace, and your inevitable meeting with the Empress...

>...as you approach the palace, some worries begin to cloud your mind.
>"Subina... is this really gonna be... alright?"
>She frowns.
>"What do you mean?"
>"Will the Empress be okay with... us?  I'm from a species your people have never heard of; a species that you're barred from contacting by Imperial Decree.  Do you really think she'll be willing to bend the rules?"
>Subina continues to frown, and places a hand on your shoulder.  
>"Anon... there is no need to worry about this sort of thing. I will handle that issue.  All that is required of you is to make a good impression, and to avoid angering her.  Given your attitude, I have every bit of confidence in your diplomatic skills."
>She gently squeezes your shoulder with a smile.
>"It will all be alright.  I promise you."
>Reassured, you smile and continue walking. 
>It's not long before you enter the palace gates.

>The interior is... not quite what you expected.
>Unlike what you've seen of Nocterran architecture, the palace's interior is very ornate and maximalist.
>Practically everything is in some shade of purple, and there are silver accents in several places.
>Many advanced machines seem to be integrated into your surroundings, including an array of robotic guardsmen.  The metallic Nocterrans eye you cautiously.
>Again, you swear you can hear music being piped in.  Surely it's just your imagination.
[https://youtube.com/watch?v=uT-1Wp8hIB0]
>A tall, elderly Nocterran man in a purple suit approaches you and Subina.
>"Ah, Admiral.  Wonderful to see you.  The Empress has been expecting you, as I'm certain you're aware."
>"Thank you.  Is she ready for our audience with her?"
>"Indeed.  Please enter her throne room posthaste."
>Subina nods and leads you down a lengthy hallway.  A very large door slowly opens up...

>Your heart races.  You're about to meet the leader of an alien race, and it's finally hit you.  You're both excited... and terrified.
>You gently grab Subina's hand, and she quickly interlaces her fingers with yours.  She meets your eyes, then nods.
>She draws herself up to her full, commanding height, and puts on a stoic expression.  You follow suit, standing straight and confident.
>The two of you enter the lavishly decorated throne room.
>The door closes and seals behind you.
>Two lines of robotic guards surround you on either side, each robot glaring down at you.  Regardless, you and your fiancée advance.
>As you approach, you take a look at the Empress, sitting patiently on her throne.
>Even seated, it's clear that she is shorter than Subina.  She also seems to be younger.  Her fur is a rich royal purple, contrasting the Admiral's near-black.
>She wears a very ornate outfit, covered in silver accents, and clutches a minimalist silver goblet.  A tiara rests atop her head.  Her narrowed eyes are a silvery grey.
>The Empress stares down her snout at you haughtily as you walk.
>You maintain your stoic look, despite your nerves going berserk.  Subina also keeps up her authoritative posture.  Though, you suspect she isn't nervous in the slightest.
>The Empress clears her throat pointedly when the two of you stop walking.
>In a very prim and proper voice, she addresses your fiancée.
>"Admiral.  Kindly explain to me what this individual is and why it is in my palace."
>She gestures towards you dramatically, maintaining pointed eye contact.  Some unknown purple fluid nearly spills from her goblet.
>She momentarily breaks her icy eye contact, and moves to prevent her drink from making a mess.

>Remembering that you shouldn't speak unless spoken to, you merely wait for Subina to answer.
>"This is Anon.  He is a human, the dominant race on a planet known as Earth."
>The Empress raises an eyebrow, still eyeing you up.
>"I see.  Where is this Earth?  I have not heard of it."
>"Earth is quite a vast distance away from Nocten.  I only landed there due to an erroneous jump."
>"Mm.  I see.  How did you come to meet this... Anon?"
>Again, she gestures with her drink, causing it to slosh ominously.  Again, she drops her stoic glare in favor of momentary panic as she makes sure to catch every drop of her drink.
>As soon as she returns to her original posture, Subina speaks.
>"When I crashed, Anon found me.  He helped me out of the crater, took me to his home, and administered medical care.  He then proceeded, over the span of a few days, to aid in the creation of an emergency beacon."
>Again, the Empress raises an eyebrow.
>"This human, with no knowledge of Nocterran technology, aided you, the brilliant leader of our entire military and the daughter of the esteemed Professor Namet, in the construction of an emergency beacon."
>"Yes, he did."
>A very faint smile spreads across the Empress's face; she takes a conspicuous drink from her goblet to cover it.
>"I see.  Pray tell: why have you brought him here?"
>Subina meets the Empress's icy gaze fearlessly.
>"We are in love, and engaged."
>Suddenly, the Empress's demeanor breaks down for a moment.  She looks legitimately shocked, her jaw dropping.
>She stammers incoherently for a moment, and shakily raises her cup to her lips again.
>Eventually, she manages to regain her composure, affixing Subina with an even colder glare.
>"I... see.  Tell me: is Earth a young planet?"
>Subina sighs.
>"Yes."
>There's a pause.  The Empress stares in silence, fury slowly becoming apparent.
>"I see.  Admiral, you are aware that contact with a young civilization is expressly forbidden by Imperial Decree, yes?"

>Subina nods solemnly.
>The Empress's voice remains eerily calm, but her anger slowly becomes more and more visible on her face.
>"Yes, and yet here you stand, in my throne room, speaking directly to me, holding hands with living proof of your violation of said Decree."
>Another nod.
>"And I suppose you expect me to have no issues with this?  To not point out the illegality of this?  To- to gloss over the fact that my most trusted advisor has flown so brazenly in the face of her planet's laws???"
>The Empress slowly slips out of her formal, even tone of voice and into a hysterical, increasingly loud tone.  She gestures wildly with her goblet, glaring at you pointedly.
>Subina maintains eye contact with the raging monarch.  She eventually speaks.
>"Fernetis.  It is customary to offer unconditional citizenship to any spouse of a Nocterran citizen, especially those of a high-ranking officer.  Anon is my fiancée, and so that offer applies to him as well."
>The Empress sputters angrily.
>"That may be so, but that does not apply to species that are actively hostile to Nocten, nor to members of young civilizations."
>Subina smiles serenely despite her leader's mounting rage.
>"Ah, but that is not true."
>The Empress freezes, silver eyes widening.
>"What?"
>"Fernetis, that Decree makes no reference to young civilizations.  The only condition is that the spouse is not of a species that is at war with Nocten.  Humans are not our enemies, therefore Anon is perfectly acceptable."
>There's an extremely long pause.  The Empress stares, mouth agape.
>She shakes with anger, and tosses her cup skyward.
>"YOU DARE USE THE WORDING OF THE LAW AGAINST ME?  THE LAW MY PREDECESSORS PENNED BY HAND?"
>Suddenly, the goblet falls back down, bonking the Empress over the head and spilling its contents all over her.
>Her glare intensifies, her fur drips.  She turns her furious gaze over to you.
>"Well?  Speak.  Do not hide behind your lover."

>Your nerves are starting to make it hard to keep up your facade.  You bow slightly and begin speaking.
>"Your Majesty, the Admiral told me about this Decree back on Earth.  Earth does not have FTL travel, and we are admittedly a while away from developing it."
>The Empress looks unimpressed, a torrent of her drink running down the length of her snout.
>"I told her I understood.  I was prepared to say farewell to her forever, to let her go home alone.  It would have broken my heart, but I was willing to do it for her."
>...is her glare softening a little...?
>"But, now that we are engaged, I will be there for her.  I would go to the ends of the universe if she needed me to do so. My people may be young by your standards, but we are by no means savages."
>The Empress stares at you, seething.
>"...tell me this.  Which of you proposed to the other?"
>"...the Admiral proposed to me."
>Almost immediately, her fury flares up again.  She rounds on Subina.
>"Is that true, Admiral?"
>Subina nods.
>"I see.  So not only did you violate the Decree, you in fact INITIATED this engagement.  I was originally under the impression that this... HUMAN had proposed, and thus was unaware of the Decree.  Knowing that it was in fact the Admiral of Nocten that started all this paints this in an even harsher light."
>She rises from her throne, imposing despite being shorter than your fiancée.
>"You should be ashamed of yourself.  To break the law so flippantly, and to have the sheer audacity to reach for a loophole rather than admit fault.  I've half a mind to- to-"
>She stutters, unable to finish her thought.  She glares angrily, rubbing her head where the goblet struck her.
>She glances over at you.
>"Speak.  I have no desire to hear the Admiral at this moment.

>You're not liking this woman's tone.  Despite only knowing her for a week or two, you can't stand to see Subina talked to that way.
>That said, you decide to keep your tongue in check for now.  The Empress could easily jail you... or worse.
>She continues to stare at you, rubbing her head.
>"Well?  Have you nothing more to say to me, human?"
>...you vaguely remember something.
>You were sure to wear a nice shirt for this meeting, and you've got a handkerchief folded up in your shirt pocket.
>You gently remove it.
>"Your Majesty, would you like to use this to dry off?"
>She roughly snatches it from your hand.  She blots her face with the handkerchief, then dries off part of her outfit.
>She begrudgingly addresses you.
>"...thank you.  This does nothing to change the situation, however."
>"I understand.  I just wanted to offer you some help."
>Her glare softens again.
>"...tell me.  What is your angle, human?"
>"My angle?  I simply wanted to do something nice for you.  No strings attached."
>"I suppose that was your rationale behind aiding the Admiral as well?"
>"Yes, it was, Your Majesty.  I had no intentions of falling in love.  I just wanted to do the right thing by helping someone in need.  The Admiral had suffered a head wound, so I bandaged her.  Her ship was destroyed, so I helped her salvage what could be saved.  She had no means of contacting Nocten, so I helped her construct a beacon of her own design.  All this because helping her was the right thing to do."
>"...and so, you merely offered me this cloth... because it was the right thing to do.  Not to defuse this problem, nor to win me over."
>"Yes, Your Majesty.  That's precisely why."
>Her expression is calmer now, though she's still visibly and audibly upset.
>"I see.  I had thought that perhaps you only aided my Admiral for the express purpose of courting her.  However... if your words are true, you have more integrity than that."
>She rubs the top of her head again.

>"Your Majesty, my people have been forever dreaming of the opportunity to meet an alien race.  Until I met the Admiral, I thought that that dream would never come true."
>The Empress looks a bit confused.
>"Humans have no contact with ANY other race?"
>"No, we do not.  But, because meeting someone of an alien race was such a dream, I never even considered taking advantage of the Admiral's situation.  I simply wanted to help her because, were I in that situation, I would hope to receive that sort of help."
>She seems to be calming down...
>"...I see."
>She turns to Subina.
>"Admiral.  If this human's help was not intended to woo you... what is it that endeared him to you?"
>"Though he did not intend it, his kindness and selflessness is what led me to fall in love.  He is a caring, loving, understanding man who willingly gave so much of his time to me simply because I needed his aid."
>"I see..."
>She sighs, still kneading the top of her head.
>"...this is quite a lot to process."
>Subina nods.
>"Yes, and I apologize for bringing this issue to you."
>The Empress waves a hand dismissively.  She speaks, slowly slipping into a far more casual tone.  She gently sinks into her chair.
>"It... it's fine, Subina.  I-I'm sorry for getting so fired up."
>"No need to apologize, Fernetis.  I know you are under a lot of pressure to uphold the Decrees of your predecessors."
>The Empress nods sadly, then turns to you.
>"Anon, was it?  I apologize for my behavior.  My stress is no reason to lash out."
>"It's fine, Your Majesty."
>She extends a hand.
>"You may call me... Fernetis."

>"Fernetis.  It's a pleasure to meet you properly."
>She gestures theatrically again.
>"Likewise, Anon."
>Subina smiles at Fernetis, slowly dropping her Admiral persona.
>"Fernetis, I am glad you heard Anon out.  He is a good man."
>The Empress smiles slightly.
>"Think nothing of it.  It's my duty to hear people out.  I still say your engagement is toeing a line, but... if what you say is true, it's not violating any laws."
>"I assure you that my explanation is accurate.  VHL and I researched the Decree."
>"I should've guessed.  You're always so thorough, Subina.  That's why I'm grateful to have you around."
>Fernetis looks over at you.
>"...I'm sure you think me rather foolish, putting on such a show."
>"Not at all.  There's no shame in being passionate in your work."
>She smiles again.
"Thank you for understanding.  I'm sure you must have many questions.  Please, feel free to ask away."

>"May I ask how you and Subina know each other so well?"
>Fernetis smiles and emphatically sweeps a hand toward the Admiral.
>"Subina is one of my most trusted officers.  I have known her for a very long time; since before I became Empress.  She's not only my Admiral, she is a very close friend."
>Your fiancée nods.
>"Indeed.  I have known Fernetis since she was very young, and we are very close friends."
>"That's great to hear.  I'm glad you two are so close."
>The Empress smiles again.  You can't help but notice that she continues to wave her empty goblet about, as if it were full.  Must be a habit.
>"Okay, err... what sort of customs are you required to uphold?"
>Her smile fades, replaced with a resigned expression.
>"Many, many duties rest upon my shoulders.  It comes with the crown, you see.  ...again, I apologize.  I am under a lot of stress, but I shouldn't have snapped at the two of you like that."
>"It's fine, honestly.  Is there anything you'd like to know about Earth?"
>"Actually, yes: what sort of achievements in space travel have you humans had?"
>"Admittedly, nothing as advanced as FTL travel, but we have explored a fair amount of our Solar System via probes and rovers.  We've also landed on our moon and launched a rather large space station."
>Fernetis nods sagely.
>"I see.  Thank you for sharing that, Anon."
>She maintains eye contact, and absentmindedly attempts to sip from her empty cup.  When nothing happens, she smiles sheepishly.
>"...oh dear.  I'll have to get Sejeve to bring me another..."
>The door to the throne room opens, and the elderly gentleman from before enters.
>"I shall get right on that, Your Majesty."
>He exits again.  Fernetis smiles genuinely.
>"He's such a wonderful assistant."

>"Fernetis, how widespread is intelligent life throughout the universe?"
>Her eyes practically light up.
>"Intelligent species are rather abundant, though there aren't many inhabited planets close to Nocten.  Our nearest neighbor is Toldrum, home of the Caithians.  That being said, there are many, many civilizations spread all across the cosmos.  It's breathtaking even now..."
>As she speaks, she waves her empty goblet in an arc above her head.
>"I see.  Back on Earth, we had a system set up to seek out alien life.  In fact... Subina and I temporarily commandeered this system to send her distress signal home."
>Fernetis smiles sympathetically.
>"Your people have been seeking out other intelligent races?  And yet you've had no luck?  You poor things."
>"Well, in a way, it's a good thing that SETI exists.  Without it, Subina may have never made it home."
>"Yes, and our world would have lost a wonderful woman."
>Subina smiles bashfully, giving you the impression she's blushing under her fur.
>Something comes to mind...
>"Fernetis, would you like to try some Earth food later?  I brought along what's called mint ice cream."
>The Admiral's face lights up.
>"Oh, Fernetis, you absolutely must try it.  It is truly wonderful."
>The Empress raises an eyebrow, smiling.
>"Well, if Subina is that enthusiastic, I suppose I'll have to give it a shot."
>"Great.  I'll bring some by later."
>She nods.
>"I look forward to it, Anon."

>Now that your hostess has softened up, you decide to tell her about yourself.
>You rattle off your life story, taking about your job, your enthusiasm for space, and going more into detail about your time with Subina.  Fernetis listens intently.
>When you finish talking, she smiles.
>"It seems as though you've lived a good life thus far.  Thank you for sharing that with me."
>"Of course.  Would you care to tell me a little about yourself?"
>"Certainly.  My father served with Siris, Subina's father, and my mother worked along with Professor Namet on several projects.  As you know, the Admiral is older than I am, and so she often took up time with me when my father was out.  The two of us became fast friends, and we've remained close ever since.  When I campaigned to become Empress, Subina was already the Admiral.  She's been here for me since the day I took the throne.  Honestly... without her, I fear the weight of the crown might get to me..."
>Fernetis frowns slightly.
>"I see.  Fernetis, I appreciate you being open with me, and especially hearing me out."
>"Of course, Anon.  Think nothing of it.  You are important to Subina, it seems; what sort of friend would I be if I didn't support her love of you?"
>She smiles gently and again raises the empty cup to her lips.
>"...I really must get out of this habit.  I look rather silly doing it."

>"May I ask how long you've been Empress?"
>Fernetis smiles and gestures again.
>"Oh, let me think... about 5 years?  Err, Nocterran years, that is."
>"Oh, I see.  How exactly does this government work?  On Earth, we have numerous countries with distinct governments, rather than having one global government..."
>She smiles again, but it seems forced.
>"Nocten's central government is of course led by myself.  There are a few agencies that work beneath me, but I am the ultimate authority.  I do everything I can to uphold the laws of my predecessors, pass new laws as needed, and toss out laws that no longer work.  I am solely responsible for practically every decision our government makes, and I am subject to be removed from the throne if the people will it so."
>...you begin to notice the bags under her eyes.  Though she hides it well, Fernetis is obviously exhausted.
>"...it is a very involved position.  I'm under quite a bit of stress."
>"I should say so, you poor thing."
>She grins again, more earnestly this time.
>"Your concern is appreciated, Anon.  I'm fine, though I didn't know it'd be like this when I began campaigning."
>"I see.  Do you mind if I ask something else real quick?  Is the engagement..."
>She looks at you expectantly, then finishes your question.
>"...okay?  Legal?  Yes.  It's all fine, as far as I'm aware.  I'll of course review that Decree later, but for now I'm inclined to believe that Subina did her research."
>You breathe a sigh of relief.
>"...Anon, your home planet and your race will be publicized, since your fiancée is such a public figure.  Is that alright?"
>You nod.
>"Of course.  I don't mind."
>"Excellent!"
>Again, she tries to drink from her empty goblet, only to growl in frustration and set it down.
>"Ugh.  I need to stop doing that."

>You gently, politely take the goblet from the floor beside Fernetis.  She frowns, but makes no effort to stop you.
>"What were you drinking, anyway?"
>She smiles sheepishly and breaks eye contact.
>"...err... that's not really important."
>Subina narrows her eyes.
>"Fernetis, perhaps you should refrain from indulging when hosting an audience."
>The Empress looks up at Subina.
>"But... it helps my nerves."
>The Admiral merely holds her unimpressed gaze.
>"...okay, you have a point.  I suppose."
>You smile at the Empress as another question comes to mind.
>"Fernetis, would you like to attend our wedding, when the time comes?"
>Immediately, she breaks into a toothy grin.
>"Actually... seeing as Subina is my Admiral, I was already going to attend.  But, I really appreciate you formally inviting me.  I'll be there."
>Subina smiles at her friend.
>"I look forward to it, Fernetis."
>You nod in agreement.
>"It'll be good to have you there."
>Fernetis smiles bashfully, giving you the impression she's blushing.

>"So, are there any astronomical research facilities or observatories on Nocten?  I worked in that field back on Earth."
>Fernetis nods emphatically, gesturing grandly.
>"Oh yes, there are a few.  I can't exactly promise you a job, but I'm certain they'll be interested in you if you apply for a career... I assume you have credentials, yes?"
>You nod, and she continues.
>"Wonderful.  I hope you do apply; It'll do you well to have a familiar career, I'm sure."
>"My thoughts exactly."
>The Empress smiles warmly again, then pauses for a moment.
>"I've thoroughly enjoyed this conversation, but I'm afraid our time is nearly up.  Are there any other questions?"
>"Err... could I maybe get a tour of the palace?"
>Fernetis scoffs and waves a hand dismissively.
>"You have to ask?  Subina can show you around, I don't mind.  Just be sure to let the guards know, and don't go into restricted areas, Admiral."
>Subina nods curtly.
>"Of course, Fernetis."
>The Empress turns back to you.
>"Alright, anything else?"

>You have a very worrying urge to ask Fernetis how... strongly... she is affected by that biological quirk that Subina has demonstrated.
>You stop yourself, not wanting to point blank ask an Empress how big her chest gets when she's hot under the collar.
>"I... I think I'm good, actually.  Thank you for having us, Fernetis."
>She smiles again, and gently pats you atop the head.
>"It was a pleasure to meet you, Anon."
>Subina politely bows, and Fernetis pats her head as well.
>"Thank you for bringing him around, Subina.  I wish you two the best."
>Your fiancée smiles and hugs her friend tightly.
>"Thank you, Fernetis."
>With that, the two of you leave the throne room.  You make sure to return the Empress's goblet first, of course.
>As soon as the door closes behind you, you begin looking around for a private place.  Subina gives you a confused look.
>"What are you looking for, Anon?"
>"Somewhere we can be alone."
>She smiles.
>"Oh, I think I know a good place.  Why do you want to be alone?"
>"I just want to spend some private time with the woman I love."
>She smiles again, and tugs at the collar of her shirt.  She avoids meeting your eye, and leads you into a dark hallway.
>As soon as you stop walking, you pull her into a passionate kiss.
>The two of you lock lips, and you pull her as close as you can.  Once she's there, you covertly maneuver your hands downward...
>then you grab a cheek in each hand.  She jolts upright for a moment before relaxing again, clearly enjoying your affections.
>Meanwhile, you enjoy the handfuls of firm, toned ass.
>You maintain the kiss for what feels like forever, the two of you locked together in a physical display of your love for one another.
>Eventually, she breaks away, smiling dazedly.  Her lavender eyes practically shimmer with happiness and adoration.
>...you can't help but notice that her shirt has become rather strained around the chest area...
>You decide not to call attention to it right now.

>Instead, you decide to tease her.
>"So, uh... care to show me some of the highlights of the palace?"
>She nods wordlessly, adjusts her shirt strategically, and leads you on a tour.
>As she takes you through various rooms, gardens, and passages, she reminisces on her friendship with Fernetis.
>You pat her on the back almost constantly, occasionally slipping in an ass grab or two when nobody's around.
>She doesn't seem to mind at all, though she does stammer a few times when speaking...
>"I have known Fernetis since she was very young.  H-her parents worked alongside mine in their respective fields, as she said.  F-Fernetis is rather young for an Empress, being only 20 Nocterran years of age.  Or, 30 Earth years."
>Subina pauses and again adjusts her steadily-tightening shirt.
>"Err... h-her mother once campaigned for Empress years ago, and lost by a narrow margin.  I suspect that is what drove Fernetis to campaign."
>You begin to notice a very faint panting between her sentences...
>"U-uh... Fernetis is always so casual when there is nobody around but friends.  Some people would n-not like that about her, I fear.  They m-might think her unprofessional."
>She's desperately trying to keep up her composure now, and failing.
>It's time to end this.
>"Subina, I've enjoyed this little tour, and your stories.  But, there's something else I wanna see now."
>"O-oh?  What's that?"
>"Your home."
>She smiles warmly.
>"O-of course.  We'll make our way there n-now."
>She shakily leads you out of the palace, bidding Sejeve farewell.
>You quickly notice a worryingly hungry expression flit across her face a few times.  She glances down at you occasionally, smiling unconvincingly.
>You wonder if she thinks you don't notice her grabbing YOUR ass.

>Rather than call her out on getting handsy, you simply smile and keep up your back rub/ass grab combo, slowing and increasing your pace to keep her going.
>Clearly, it's working.  Her walk becomes a bit staggered, her panting more pronounced, and her groping of you more obvious.
>...though you're enjoying this, it's probably not so good to let someone of her position wander the city in this state.
>"Subina, uh... my legs are kinda tired.  Is there like... a taxi service we could use?  Preferably unmanned?"
>"Hm...?  O-oh, yes.  There- there is..."
>Grape chimes in from your PDA.
>"I can call the transport system to your location, if you like."
>"Go ahead, Grape."
>The digital avatar nods and vanishes.
>The two of you stop walking, with Subina shakily rubbing a hand along your back.
>Before long, an automated hovercraft of sorts arrives.  You quickly board it with your fiancée, and it takes off at a breakneck pace.
>"A-are they always this fast?"
>Subina smiles and nods.
>"Their AI is advanced enough to completely avoid any and all collisions, so this speed is perfectly safe."
>Sure enough, it's mere minutes before you arrive at a rather modest home.
>It's... not far off from your house in terms of size, actually.  A quick survey of your surroundings reveals that the city is quite a distance away.
>The Admiral smiles and leads you into her home.
>As expected, everything is purple.  Subina's home is rather sparsely decorated, adhering to the minimalist designs you've seen elsewhere on Nocten.
>Several holographic photos are on display, showing Subina in what your assume is her uniform, her with her parents, her with Fernetis...
>Aside from these, there are several star maps of systems you don't recognize, as well as models of planets you've never seen before.
>All of this adds up to make you feel surprisingly at home.

>As you explore her home, Subina quietly hovers behind you.
>Occasionally, you ask her about some of the decor, and she breathily responds.
>Clearly, she has... other things in mind.
>Oh, to be a mind reader like the twins right about now...
>Though you note with a smirk that, judging by her expression and body language, Subina's thoughts would probably scar Tes and Neph for life.

<Subina>

>She was torn.
>On one hand, letting her desires show so plainly was embarrassing.  A woman of her rank and age should be better at controlling herself.
>To think she found herself nearly staggering out of the Palace, mouth agape and tongue rolling out.
>And yet...
>Another part of her mind could only think of how very badly she wanted Anon.
>Something about his actions, the sheer confidence behind them...
>She couldn't help but shudder in anticipation.
>She snuck another quick grab of his ass, and returned to simply following him around the house.
>...she wondered if he'd notice the doors locking behind them as they went.

<Anon>

>After seeing every room of her home, you turn to Subina with a smile.
>"I have to say, your house is wonderful.  I love it."
>You pull her into a hug, and plant a kiss on her snout.  She practically melts at the touch of your lips.
>"A-Anon... there is one more room to see."
>She takes your hand and leads you, rather quickly, down a hallway.
>Once you step into the dark room, the door closes and audibly locks behind you.
>A dim light comes on, revealing...
>A large, plush bed.
>...you begin to sweat.

>Subina places a shaking hand on your shoulder.  You look up at her...
>And are both concerned and aroused at the sight of her hungrily licking her lips.
>A seductive smile spreads across her face, and you immediately know what needs to be done.
>Without a word, you begin undressing her.  Subina practically vibrates with anticipation, and you feel your pants tightening.
>Considering the pressure put upon the chest of her shirt, it's a bit tricky to remove it.  As soon as you manage, her breasts bounce free, with her sighing appreciatively.
>Once she's fully nude, Subina throws herself onto the bed, lounging seductively.  You quickly undress yourself, and watch her eyes scan up and down your body.
>By the time you lie down next to her, Subina is panting.  She leans close to you and whispers.
>"I'm yours.  Do whatever you please."
>That's all you need to hear.  You immediately begin a full assault.
>You pull her close, and kiss her passionately.  Meanwhile, you grab her ass with one hand, and one of her tits with the other.
>Judging by her moans, you're doing something right.  Once you break the kiss off, her tongue flops out of her mouth.
>Her eyes practically glaze over in pleasure, and she can't maintain enough composure to say anything but your name.
>For her part, she's putting in some work as well.
>She wraps her arms and legs around you, her cool fur caressing every inch of your bare skin.  Her hands gently, sensually run up and down the length of your back, her fur sending pleasurable chills down your spine.
>Her enlarged chest presses against yours, her heartbeat racing.  Her tail swishes through the air aimlessly.
>It's clear from her expression that she's in paradise.  And, to tell the truth, you are as well.

>With a sly wink, you gently reposition yourself to be face-to-tit with Subina.  Before she can react, you quickly take to draining her weighty chest.
>As soon as you do, she practically screams in ecstasy. She plants a hand on the back of your head, with the other continuing to shakily rub your back.
>You gently reach back and grab her hand.  She interlocks her fingers with yours, and you break away from your duty.
>The two of you meet eyes, and she speaks.
>"Anon... I-I love you."
>"I love you too."
>You start to return to sucking, then she suddenly claps a hand onto your shoulders.
>"N-no... I-I need more... just take me..."
>You don't need to hear anything else.
>Again, you reposition yourself, this time lower than before.  You carefully shift yourself around, seeking your destination.
>As soon as you find your mark, you plunge your length into Subina.  You're immediately met with a wonderful warmth and a lengthy scream of pleasure.
>"D-don't stop... ever."
>You wouldn't dream of it.  With her moans and words of encouragement to guide you, you quickly slip into a steady rhythm of thrusts.
>Time stops.  The only thing that matters is your fiancée's enjoyment of this.  
>Panting, moaning, occasionally screaming, she puts on a one-woman serenade that keeps you going for what feels like an eternity.

>Though this is all very heavenly for you, you are far more concerned with making sure Subina enjoys herself.
>In fact, you make sure to dedicate the entirety of your efforts to maximizing her pleasure.
>You lovingly run a hand down her back, feeling her twitch and shiver at your touch.  You gently tease her sensitive breasts, with her moaning appreciatively.
>All the while, you maintain your rhythm, steadily accelerating as your climax approaches.
>Judging by her rapid panting and how hard she squeezes your hand, you suspect that Subina is on the razor's edge as well.
>You keep up your thrusting, rubbing, and teasing until you can no longer contain yourself.  You disengage from her breasts again to ask an important question.
>"Subina... c-can I-"
>She interrupts you with a deep moan.
>"D-do it.  Don't you dare pull out."
>Without missing a beat, you comply, unloading within your lover's slit.
>A long howl of ecstasy soon follows as she reaches her own orgasm.  The two of you promptly collapse into each other's arms.
>She pulls you close, burying your face between her tits.  She gently throws a leg over you, and wraps her arms around you.
>Satisfied, Subina plants a kiss on your forehead.
>She takes your hand again, and the two of you simply lie there.  Cuddled up as close as you can, basking in the afterglow of your performance.
>This... is paradise.

>Having caught your breath, you cuddle up as close to your fiancée as you can.  She wraps her arms around you lovingly, and you do the same.
>"Subina, t-that was amazing."
>She smiles serenely.
>"Anon, I... thank you.  That was wonderful."
>The two of you merely smile and stare into each other's eyes for a while, getting lost in your thoughts...

<Subina>

>A surprising clarity washed over her mind.
>All her desires had been quelled by Anon's touch, and now she could think more freely.
>She continued to stare deep into his loving eyes, smiling.
>It was surreal.  Her first intimate experience, shared with not only a man of a different species, but a man from a planet her people had never heard of until recently.  Not even that:  she had shared it with her fiancée.  The man she loved.
>Anon.
>Happiness flooded her mind as she thought about their future.  No more lonesome nights, lying in bed, haunted by her memories.  No more coming home to an empty house, with only VHL to talk to.
>A few tears of joy welled up in her eyes.

<Anon>

>It's frankly hard to believe.
>You just lost your virginity... with a beautiful woman from another planet.  A woman who singlehandedly leads her people's military, who gained a working knowledge of English in a matter of days, who designed a functional distress beacon in a night.
>A woman... who despite her stoic appearance in public, was vulnerable inside.  One who needed support and understanding, and loved you for providing it.
>Not just a woman; your fiancée.  The woman you love.
>Subina.

>Wrapped in comfort and warmth, you feel yourself starting to doze off.
>You plant a kiss on Subina's cheek, and she returns the favor, drowsiness beginning to dawn on her face as well.
>Arms wrapped around one another, you fall into a comfortable sleep, resting for the biggest test yet:
>Meeting Siris.
>A vague sense of dread washes over you, and is immediately extinguished by Subina gently draping her tail over your body.
>With that, you fully slip out of consciousness.  You're vaguely aware of the lights in the room fading to black...

<VHL>

>Within the many devices in their user's home, VHL monitored the situation with warm smiles.
>Subina had... err, clearly enjoyed herself with Anon, judging by the outbursts.
>Once the happy couple began to fall asleep, the trio of AIs politely turned out the lights unprompted.
>Heather momentarily considered teasing her user about her, ah... volume tomorrow, but decided against it.
>Instead, she merely giggled about it with her sisters.
>With that, the AIs simply waited until morning, ready to wake up Subina and her fiancée...

<Anon>

>You are awoken by a musical chime and a three-woman chorus of voices.
>"Good morning, you two~!"
>You stretch and yawn as you rise out of Subina's bed.  She too stretches, her fur shining in the now-bright light.
>"Good morning, Subina."
>She smiles dazedly and pats your back in lieu of a response.  Though it's rather subtle compared to last night, her chest is a bit larger than her normal size.
>The two of you quickly get dressed, then make your way to the kitchen.
>A holographic avatar of VHL stands at what you assume is the Nocterran equivalent of a stove.  The three heads smile warmly.
>"Morning, lovebirds.  We made breakfast, if you're hungry."
>Smiling appreciatively, both you and Subina grab your plates and begin scarfing down some food.  You barely even notice what it is, you simply eat.

>As you eat, it occurs to you that you'll probably be meeting Subina's father today.  ...you're not exactly looking presentable at the moment, what with your hair going wild, the smell of Subina all over you...
>Err, hang on.  That last bit may not actually be an issue in Nocterran culture?
>Hm.
>"Say, uh... should I go get cleaned up, so we can see your parents?"
>"Mm?  I... suppose?  I do not know how Earth culture handles scent."
>"Uh... how do Nocterrans handle it?"
>"I assume our sense of smell is beyond yours, and so there are things we pick up on that you may not.  Such as the smell of a woman on her husband... or fiancée."
>"Right... well, uh..."
>...should you take advantage of her ignorance on Earth?
>"...on Earth, it varies, sorta.  So, do you think I ought to clean up, or no?"
>Subina seems torn.
>"...I do not wish to deprive you of your culture, but... I also would like for you to blend in with Nocten's..."
>The two of you hem and haw about the situation for a while before Violet cheerfully chips in.
>"Whatever you do, decide quickly: Professor Namet and Siris are en route.  They'll be here in about half an hour~"
>You share a look of horror with your lover, and the two of you dash off to the washroom.
>Once in there, Subina activates what seems to be simply a shower.  She silently disrobes and steps under the flow of water, sighing contentedly as the water cascades down her fur.
>After a moment, she motions for you to join her, which you do with no hesitatio-
>DAMN THAT'S COLD
>You forgot that Nocterrans don't do hot water.  The showerhead is dousing you down with a chilly spray.
>Seeing you shiver, Subina pulls you close to her, her wet fur pressing against your skin.
>...it almost gets your motor running for another round.  Or, it would if you weren't so cold.
>The two of you quickly clean up, helping each other to save time.
>Subina's tail swishes happily as you run your fingers through her fur, lathering it up.

>Once you're both good and clean, you step out and dry off.  You quickly change back into the clothes you wore to meet Fernetis, and rush back into the living room.
>VHL's avatar serenely wanders about.
>"Oh, Anon: your personal items were delivered last night before you two got home from meeting the Empress."
>"Great, thank you.  ...is there a way to turn up the heat on the shower, by any chance?"
>Lilac chuckles.
>"Yes, we'll make a note to increase the temperature when it's just you.  Your things are in the guest room."
>You thank the AIs again, and rush off to grab something.
>You return with your old desk globe. You slot Earth in with the other planet models on display.  As you admire your handiwork, you hear Subina coming down the hall.
>She's dressed more casually than before, rather than being in uniform.  She smiles warmly at you, then takes notice of your addition to her decor.
>"That fits very well, don't you think?  I believe Mother will like to see that."
>She lays a hand on your shoulder, and beams at you.
>Suddenly, there's another chime.
>"They're here, Anon.  Please answer the door."
>You comply, gulping nervously...
>As soon as the door opens, you find yourself met with a broad, muscular Nocterran man.  He's a fair bit taller than you, but still shorter than your fiancée.  His fur is nearly as dark as Subina's, and a few scars cover his snout.
>You can only assume this is Siris.  He glowers down at you, then speaks in a gruff voice.
>"Yer the human, right?  Smaller than I expected.  Heh.  Why, you're probably... what, 6 feet?  I bet you feel pretty small next to me, huh?  And ya should!"
>You laugh nervously as Siris guffaws loudly.  Suddenly, you hear a familiar voice clear her throat: Namet.
>She pushes past her husband and smiles at you.
>"Hello again, Anon.  I see you've already met Siris."
>You nod shakily as Subina makes her way to your side.

>Subina greets her parents warmly as they enter her home.  Namet walks alongside her as you all head to the living room, while Siris makes a beeline for a rather large chair.
>He roughly sits down, eyeing you up.
>Once Namet sits down, you take a seat next to Subina.  Your heart is pounding...
>You manage to work up the nerve to speak.
>"Well... let me introduce myself: I'm Anon.  I'm from Earth, which is pretty far away from here."
>Namet nods politely, and Siris looks thoroughly unimpressed.  He speaks up.
>"Yeah yeah.  My wife already told me about that; get to how you met my sweet baby girl, how bout it."
>"Well, she crash landed near my house, and she was hurt when I found her.  So, I took her home and bandaged her head.  Then, after a few days, she started planning how to get home.  She designed a beacon, and I helped her salvage bits of her ship to build it."
>At this revelation, Siris looks a bit more impressed.
>"So, you made yourself useful, eh?  How'd you fall in love with her, boy?"
>"Sir, it's simply because your daughter is a wonderful woman."
>Siris chuckles again.
>"Yer DAMN RIGHT she's a wonderful woman. I couldn't be prouder of her."
>For the first time, you see a grin on his face.
>"So, you two just... fell fer one another in the course of calling home, yeah?  Makes sense to me.  But... I gotta say: I don't quite like how sudden this engagement is."
>Siris stands up and walks over, glowering down at you.
>"...tell me: what possessed you to propose a week into knowing my daughter?"
>Subina interjects.
>"Father, I was the one who proposed.  It was sudden because I did not want to leave Anon behind.  I love him."
>He looks over at his daughter, scrutinizing her.  Another smile breaks out.
>"I shoulda known."
>He looks down at you, and playfully punches your shoulder.  It actually hurts a good bit, but you don't let on.
>"No offense, but you don't look the type to propose to an Admiral.  Heh."
>You smile and nod.

>After you answer a barrage of questions, Siris grins again.  You're sweating bullets, despite answering everything truthful.
>"Alrighty then, I think that about covers everything.  Put her there, boy."
>Subina's father extends a hand, a hint of malice in his eyes.
>You glance at Subina, who discretely nods, then shake the man's hand.
>Suddenly, he turns it into a full on arm wrestling match.  Since you didn't expect it, he thrashes you.
>Siris guffaws loudly at his victory, only for Namet to chide him.
>"Now Siris.  That's hardly fair to the man, not giving him a chance to get ready."
>"Huh?  I was just... aw, yer right.  That wasn't right of me."
>He looks back down at you and grins.
>"Well, square up, Anon.  Let's see if ya can take your future in-law."
>You cautiously grip Siris's clawed hand.  You gulp nervously, and force a determined grin.
>As soon as the match starts, you pour every ounce of your (admittedly lacking) upper body strength into it.  You manage to hold off defeat for a good while, but eventually lose.  You're treated to another round of laughter, then...
>A genuine handshake.
>"Not bad!  You stood your ground.  I can respect that even though you lost."
>He makes his way back to his armchair and roughly sits down, smiling more genuinely than before.
>Namet clears her throat.
>"So, Anon: what do you think of our planet?"
>"It's beautiful.  It reminds me of Earth, but with a wonderful purple tint."
>"Ah, so Nocten is fairly familiar to you, then?  Very interesting."
>She notices your globe sitting alongside the other planets.
>"Oh, is this Earth?  What a lovely looking planet.  Do you mind if I have a look?"
>"Not at all."
>She gently lifts the globe and examines it closely.

>You walk over to Subina's mother and begin pointing out various landmarks.
>"Here's the tallest mountain on Earth, Everest.  Here's the Grand Canyon, one of the most famous natural wonders in America..."
>As you rattle off interesting sights, Namet smiles serenely and nods, taking in every word.  Siris eventually rises from his seat and sits next to his wife, clearly interested in the impromptu lecture himself.
>Eventually, you point out where you lived.
>"...my house is somewhere in this region, at the base of a hill.  I also found Subina there."
>Namet smiles again.
>"...do you miss it, Anon?  Your old home?"
>You think about it.
>"...I'm happy here, so far.  Besides: I still have the keys to my house, in case my old place can be used as a vacation home.  Professor, you and Siris are more than welcome to stay in my home any time, should we use it that way."
>She puts a hand to her chin in thought.
>"Hm.  I'll have to remember that.  Could be interesting to explore Earth personally."
>Subina grins.
>"I believe you would like Earth, Mother.  The only issue is that Earth can be rather hot in some places."
>Namet waves a hand dismissively.
>"Bah.  I don't like the heat, but I've been to my fair share of hot planets.  I doubt Earth is beyond me."
>Siris looks a bit concerned.
>"Now, honey, remember: we ain't even planning a trip there yet.  Hell, they're not even married yet."
>Again, Namet waves a hand.
>"They will be soon.  Besides, I'm supposed to be interested in new planets.  It's part of my career."
>Siris rolls his eyes.
>"Yeah.  Meanwhile, I'm a retired pilot, saw a ton of planets on my flights, and guess what?  I ain't got the desire to go visit every rock I ever passed."
>"What are you talking about?  Who wanted to go to Toldrum so badly he practically dragged me into his ship?"
>The bulky gent smiles sheepishly.
>"Uh... anyway, let's change the subject.  Anon, uh... show off some more Earth facts, how about it."
>You comply.

>"Let's see... the borders between countries aren't necessarily physical; they're just as much political constructs as they are actual borders."
>Siris raises an eyebrow.
>"You mean to tell me Earth doesn't have a central government? How do you humans get anything done without fighting?"
>"...well, uh... we don't always agree."
>"Hm. Call me biased, but I prefer how it works round here."
>"I understand. More interesting, probably, is our love of space."
>Siris snorts.
>"What civilization AIN'T in love with space?"
>"Well, we've been dreaming of space travel for decades, and we're beginning to make strides in the field. We've always held a fascination with the idea of extraterrestrial life, as well."
>"...don't your people KNOW there are other societies out there?"
>"No, we didn't. Subina was the very first alien to land on Earth as far as I'm aware."
>"...so your planet's just... cut off from everything? Mm."
>"It seems that way, yes. How densely packed are intelligent civilizations anyway? Is it odd for Earth to be in a system with no other habitable planets?"
>"Yeah, that's a little weird. Normally, habitable planets are pretty widespread. Dunno why yours is any different."
>Siris looks at his wife purposefully. She shrugs.
>"Don't ask me. I still need to research Earth more. On the subject: what is the weather like there?"
>"Probably more hectic than on Nocten. We have volatile storms like tornadoes and such."
>Siris cringes.
>"Oooh yeah. I've seen a few tornadoes in my day. Glad Nocten doesn't get em."
>"That's great. I hate storms, myself."
>Subina nods in agreement, letting you handle the talking.

>Namet smiles warmly at the globe of Earth, the blue reflecting in her eyes.
>"Anon, do you happen to know how far Earth is from Nocten?"
>Siris interjects before you can respond.
>"Farther than either of us is going for a vacation, that's for sure."
>The Professor glares at her husband, who merely shrugs it off.  You finally respond.
>"It's, ah... it's a pretty great distance."
>VHL, still hovering around the room, makes her way over.  Violet speaks up.
>"If we may interrupt, I have a model showing the distance in memory."
>The avatar extends a hand, and gestures as a large holographic map appears.  Namet frowns as a large line is drawn from Nocten to Earth.
>"...how many jumps did the rescue ship take between here and there?"
>"Approximately 150."
>"...and Subina's ship?"
>There's a long pause.
>"...5."
>Namet loses her composure, mouth falling open.
>"Five?  FIVE?  The rescue ship took 150 jumps, and my baby got there in FIVE?  How fast was- how far of a jump-"
>She turns to Subina with a stern expression.
>"Subina!  You ought to know better than to push a jump drive that hard; no wonder you crashed."
>Your fiancée opens her mouth to object, but Violet speaks first.
>"It wasn't her fault, Professor.  It appears that, on the fourth jump, something occurred that caused the jump drive to malfunction catastrophically, which led to the absurd length of the fifth jump and the Admiral's crash landing.  This was a freak accident, not pilot error."
>Namet glares at VHL for a moment, and slowly calms down.  She looks back at her daughter apologetically.
>"I... sorry.  I was afraid you got reckless.  I shouldn't have jumped to conclusions."
>Siris lays a hand on his wife's shoulder, smiling.  Subina hugs both her parents, beaming at them.
>"I would never do something so careless.  I am just thankful to be home."
>"We're so happy you're safe, sweetie."

>You merely sit back and smile as the happy family enjoys their moment.  VHL settles down next to you, all three heads of her avatar smiling.
>Subina breaks away from the embrace for a moment.
>"Anon, join us.  You are soon to be part of our family."
>You hesitate, but are shocked when Siris claps a hand on your shoulder.
>"Bring it in, boy.  If you're good enough for my wife and my girl, you're good enough for me."
>He grins, and you slip into the group hug.  The four of you share a moment, then break apart.
>Subina's father grins again, and winks.
>"Hey, Trip; when's grub?"
>Heather responds to him, narrowing her eyes but smiling.
>"In a few minutes, Siris."
>He chuckles loudly.
>"Siris?  That's it?  The three of ya put together can't come up with a nickname for me?  Ah well.  Let us know when it's ready, huh?  I'm starvin."
>"It's not that we can't, Siris; it's merely easier to use your real name.  And we'll be sure to notify you."
>The bulky fellow grins again as VHL's avatar fades away.
>"Heh heh.  I've always liked ol' Trip.  They don't seem to like me too much though."
>Namet smiles wryly.
>"Maybe that's because you never use their actual names, Siris."
>He scoffs, and leaves it at that.

>"Well, if you're hungry, I've got some Earth food you may wanna try."
>Subina perks up.
>"Oh, Father, Mother, you must try mint ice cream; it must surely be the best food I ate on Earth."
>Siris frowns a little.
>"You, uh... you ate local food there?"
>"Yes, I did.  It was all safe."
>"Hrm.  Alright, I'm curious.  Mind grabbing this, uh... ice cream, Anon?"
>"Of course not."
>You dash off, and soon return with the icy treat in hand.  Siris and Namet try some hesitantly, and both of them grin broadly.
>"Whoo-wee!  You weren't kidding, Subina; this stuff's great."
>"I agree; thanks, sweetie."
>The two Nocterrans continue to polish off your ice cream as you talk.
>"So, Professor: have you been to other galaxies?"
>"Oh yes, many times.  All part of my research."
>Siris snorts with laughter.
>"Yeah.  Sure is funny how her research coincidentally takes her to some of the most popular tourist galaxies there are, huh?"
>Namet punches her husband on the shoulder, a spoonful of ice cream preventing her from scolding him.
>"I see.  How common are jump drive malfunctions?"
>"Ah... more common than we'd like.  It's still a work in progress; we're always improving on it.  Always trying to make it safer and safer."
>"That's good; safety comes first."
>"Precisely, Anon.  Even if we have to limit speeds a little, it's worth it if we prevent potentially deadly accidents."
>The professor grins at you, then takes another bite of ice cream.

>A part of your mind suggests a game of Mario Kart, but... you decide against it.  You wouldn't want to make your future in-laws hate you already, right?
>Instead, you decide to just chitchat about their careers.
>"So, Professor: tell me a bit about your job."
>"Well, I've worked on a few prominent projects... namely jump tech.  Much of my work revolves around perfecting the jump drive, but I also do a lot of research on space travel in general."
>"Oh, I see.  Do you enjoy it?"
>"Oh, yes.  Absolutely."
>"That's great.  What about you, Siris?"
>"Mm, I don't do much any more since I retired.  Mainly keep things up around the house, do some odd jobs here 'n there... nothin' major."
>"What was your service like?"
>He meets your gaze intensely.
>"Hell, son.  Simple as that.  The only saving grace was being able to pilot my own ship.  Now that I'm home, I can do that on my own time, without being shot at."
>"O-oh.  How do you like flying?"
>His intense expression softens.
>"Love it.  Almost as much as my wife and baby girl.  Nothin' like cruising through the cosmos, lemme tell you..."
>He seems to drift off into reminiscing, smiling vaguely.
>Namet suddenly perks up.
>"Oh, Anon; would you like to hear some stories of when Subina was only a pup?"
>Immediately, your fiancée looks uncomfortable.  She shakes her head discretely, but her mother starts speaking anyway.
>"One time, when she was only a few years old, she-"
>Namet is interrupted by Heather.
>"Brunch is ready!  Everyone come and get it!"
>Siris immediately hops out of his chair.
>"You heard em, honey; let's eat."
>Namet sighs and rolls her eyes, but follows her husband.  You and Subina, who looks extremely relieved, follow suit.

>As the four of you sit down to brunch, you decide to keep up the conversation.
>"You were saying, Professor?"
>Subina shoots you a look and gently elbows you.
>"Hm?  Oh.  I... I don't recall what story I was going to tell.  Sorry, Anon."
>The Admiral sighs in relief.
>"Let us change the subject then.  Mother, Anon would like to continue working in his field if possible."
>"Oh?  That's splendid.  ...perhaps I could help with that?  I do have some friends in various research facilities..."
>You smile and thank the professor.  Siris fires off a question.
>"So, I gotta ask: what other kinds of food do you humans eat?"
>"All sorts of things, but we usually eat our food hot."
>At this, the older Nocterran cringes.
>"Yeeesh.  I get that we're different, but I can't get behind hot food.  Sorry."
>"I understand; we're pretty different, after all."
>"Yeah.  What's in that ice cream, anyway?"
>"Err... milk, from what's called a cow, specifically."
>"Huh.  Well that's interesting, I guess. Pretty good stuff, heh."
>...a burning question comes to mind.
>"Professor, have you heard of a galaxy called the Milky Way?"
>"Mm?  I can't say that I have.  Though... I believe I may have seen that phrase in some Caithian papers.  Perhaps they're aware of it?  I take it that Earth is in that galaxy?"
>"Yes ma'am, it is.  Can you think of any reason it seems to be out of contact with any other species?"
>"Hm.  It could be any number of factors.  Location, lack of inhabited planets in the galaxy, existence of spatial distortions... it's rather difficult to say."
>"Hm.  I see."
>Namet suddenly perks up again.
>"Ah!  Now I remember where I was.  So, when Subina was only a few years old..."
>Your fiancée sinks into her chair with an expression of embarrassment and horror.  You're pretty sure she's blushing under that fur.
>As Namet speaks, Subina sinks lower and lower into her chair, refusing to meet your eyes.

>Namet's story continues, and Subina's embarrassment grows.
>In an effort to help her through the story, you wrap an arm around her.  She smiles appreciatively, but continues to look mortified.
>Eventually, the professor ends her story with a gale of laughter.  You and Subina politely chuckle a bit as well.
>You decide to take one for the team, for the sake of your fiancée's dignity.
>"Let me tell you all about what happened to me during college.  So, there was this girl I knew..."
>Oh god.  Just remembering this story makes you want to curl into a ball and die.
>"...so, after a few months, I was all ready to ask her out on a date.  Barely knew her, didn't even have her name.  But, I called her up..."
>Ugggggh.
>"...and so, it turned out that Terry can also be a guy's name."
>Once you finish spilling the tale of the time you asked a dude out, Namet and Siris break into laughter.  Subina also can't help but chuckle; though she at least attempts to hide it.
>Namet manages to speak through her giggling.
>"Y-you poor, poor man!  Pff, Siris would've died had that happened to him!"
>"Hey!  ...yeah, yer probably right, heheh."
>At least it seems like they enjoy your stories.  Even if said stories make you want to go back and slap the shit out of your past self.

>Though your own cringeworthy tale seems to have lifted her spirits a bit, it's clear that Subina is still feeling pretty embarrassed.
>Making absolutely sure that Namet and Siris aren't watching, you carefully pat your fiancée's back.  She gently reciprocates, stopping when her parents slowly stop laughing.
>You suddenly know what needs to be said.
>"Professor, Siris, I just want to thank you.  I've only known you for less than a day, and you've already been so welcoming, so accepting of my relationship with your daughter.  Thank you both so much."
>Namet smiles, and Siris huffs.
>"Heh.  Don't get all sappy on me now, boy; like ya said, we haven't known each other that long.  ...but, yer welcome.  So long as my girl loves you, I'm willing to accept ya."
>His smile gets more intense, with him nearly baring his teeth.
>"But lemme tell you this: you hurt her, you're a dead man.  Easy as that."
>You gulp nervously, but nod.
>His expression immediately softens, and Namet looks apologetic.
>"Siris.  Don't scare him."
>"W- yes, honey.  I just wanted to level with him."
>"It's alright, Professor; he's just protective.  I get that.  Changing the subject, how do weddings work on Nocten?"
>The Professor smiles dreamily.
>"Oh, they're wonderful.  Siris and I had such a beautiful ceremony..."
>Siris sighs and rolls his eyes.
>"Aaaand here we go again."
>She doesn't even seem to hear him.
>"In Nocterran weddings, the female wears an outfit with some significance to her, and a traditional purple veil.  The male also chooses a sentimental outfit, and isn't required to wear any traditional objects beyond his chosen clothing.  The two stand before an audience of family and close friends, and confess their love for each other.  They often share stories of particularly sentimental moments, like how they met, how they fell in love..."
>"Hm.  Doesn't sound too far off from Earth weddings, actually."
>"Ha, small universe, it seems."

>"So, what about the legal parts of this?"
>"Well, let me think... citizenship will just require some identification.  I believe Minister Detam already got quite a bit of information on you.  As for your desire for a job... do you happen to have proof of your credentials?"
>"Yes ma'am, I packed my diploma."
>"Splendid.  That'll do nicely."
>Namet puts a hand to her chin, and delicately poses a question.
>"...Anon.  Your family won't be there for your marriage.  Is that okay?"
>"...yes, I'm fine with that.  My parents and I didn't see eye to eye very often.  We kinda just... separated amicably."
>"I... see."
>The Professor frowns for a while.
>"Anon, I know I'm no replacement, but I'll be there for you during the wedding.  Normally the female dances with her father, and the male with his mother, so I suppose I'll fill in for your mother."
>"That sounds fine, Professor."
>"...actually... call me Namet.  Or whatever you feel comfortable with.  Mother, Mom, Namet, anything works.  You're about to become part of our family, after all."
>Siris grunts.
>"...alright, yeah.  Same goes fer me.  Call me whatever, boy."
>They both smile warmly at you.
>"I... thank you both.  I really appreciate that."
>Subina beams at her parents.
>"Mother, Father, thank you for being so kind to Anon.  I was afraid you would not agree with our engagement."
>"Sweetie, it was a bit sudden, but given the circumstances, I understand."
>"Yeah, I get it.  It was now or never, seeing that Earth's a young planet."
>Subina hops out of her chair and hugs her parents tightly.

>Once their hug ends, Subina and her parents share a warm smile.  Another question comes to mind...
>"Namet... when can I expect to hear more about getting a research position?"
>"Likely after the wedding.  Remember: you're not legally a Nocterran citizen yet.  Rest assured I'll do what I can, though."
>"Thank you."
>There's a pause, then your future family pulls you into a lengthy group hug.  It lasts for a good while, then the four of you separate.
>Siris eventually speaks up.
>"Welp, it's been a good brunch, but I guess it's time we headed home.  Anon, it's good to meet ya."
>Namet speaks up next.
>"Indeed.  It was a pleasure to speak with you.  I'll have to do some research into these coincidental similarities in our planets.  It's simply fascinating."
>Subina waves farewell to her parents as they exit.
>As soon as the door seals shut audibly, you pull your fiancée into an embrace, patting her back.  She returns the favor, smiling lovingly.
>"Anon, thank you.  I think you made a very good impression."
>"No problem.  They're very nice.  ...anything in particular you want to do now that they're gone?"
>"Hm... perhaps there is something you would like to do?  I am open to whatever you wish to do."
>She grins again and affectionately pats your back.

>"Y'know what?  How about we just get cozy and watch a movie?"
>"That sounds nice."
>She walks over to a terminal on the wall, then pauses.
>"Are there any subjects I should avoid showing?  I would not want to play a film that upsets you."
>"As long as it's something that doesn't bother you, I'm fine."
>Subina nods and waves a hand over  the terminal.  A large holographic screen appears in the center of the room.
>You settle down on the couch, and Subina sits next to you, snuggling up close.
>The movie seems to be a nature documentary on some kind of... furry bird.  They're huge, whatever they are.
>It seems that these birds, Sohrus apparently, are among the most popular sources of meat on Nocten.
>They're very large, explosive breeders, and dumber than dirt.  Seems they avoid being hunted to extinction by sheer numbers.
>The landscapes shown are gorgeous, with majestic cliffs, sprawling deserts, and more.
>As the film goes on, you notice the background music.  It's fairly similar to some orchestrated scores you've heard in documentaries back home.  Nothing too exciting, but it's relaxing enough.
>The entire time, your fiancée is sitting practically on top of you, gently rubbing a hand up and down your back.  She occasionally looks down at you with an adoring smile and a kiss on the cheek.
>Yep.  You could definitely get used to this.

>As you simply enjoy the comfort of your position, you decide to get a little teasing in.
>You discretely run a hand down her side, eventually snaking your way down to her leg.  You delicately rub your hand along the inside of her thigh, with her smiling at your efforts.
>You begin to retract your arm... only to suddenly go for an ass grab.
>Subina yelps in surprise, but doesn't really seem to mind.  She wraps an arm around you and pulls you even closer to her side.
>She leans against you, putting most of her weight on you.  Thankfully, she's not that heavy.
>Subina sighs in contentment.
>"Anon, I love moments like this.  Just the two of us, enjoying the company of one another."
>She gazes into your eyes, her own lavender eyes glimmering in the light.
>She pulls you into a kiss, then simply embraces you tightly afterwards.
>"I want to stay like this forever."
>"Me too, Subina.  I love you."
>You gently reach up and begin stroking one of her ears.  She blinks in surprise a few times, then tilts her head towards your hand.
>Her ear is covered in soft, velvety fur, making it quite enjoyable to stroke.  She seems to enjoy your rubbing, as she smiles happily, eyes closed.  
>You eventually swap to the other ear, with her tilting her head the opposite way.
>After a while of alternating between ears, Subina's tongue gently pokes out of her mouth.  You can tell she's absolutely relaxed and comfortable, and that's all that matters to you.
>As long as she's happy, so are you.

>As she leans down to let you continue rubbing her ears and scratching behind them, Subina continues to relax, her tongue still poking out.
>You can't help but chuckle at how oddly adorable she is.
>"Y'know, you're cute when you're relaxed like this."
>Subina doesn't open her eyes, but responds quietly.
>"Mm, t-thank you."
>You can only assume she doesn't hear that very often.  You wonder how often she truly got to relax before meeting you...
>You lean close to her and whisper into her ear.
>"I want you to know that I will always be here for you.  You'll never be alone with your memories again.  I'll keep you safe."
>There's a pause, and she takes a shuddering breath.  Before you can react, she pulls you into an incredibly tight embrace, burying her face in your shoulder.
>She rapidly pats your back silently, then returns to her original position.  Once she's there, you go back to scratching her ears.
>"Say... how does scent work in Nocterran society, exactly?"
>"Mm... we can smell a woman on her spouse, and vice versa... generally a sign of love and trust between them."
>"In that case..."
>You quickly bury your face in the soft, cool fur of her neck.  She grunts in surprise, but makes no attempt to stop you.
>Once you feel as though you're sufficiently marked with her scent, you stop.  She almost looks disappointed, but soon smiles warmly.
>"You... thank you, Anon."
>Again, she pulls you into a hug.

>As she embraces you, you decide to end your bout of teasing her.
>You pull her into a tender kiss, with her keeping her arms wrapped around you tightly. The two of you remain this way for a long, comfortable while, eventually breaking apart just as the documentary's final credit rolls.
>Subina smiles at you lovingly, a small tear of happiness glinting in the corner of one of her eyes.
>"Well... what do you want to do now, Anon?"
>"Uh... how about we hit the town? You could show me around, maybe?"
>"That sounds nice. It is a lovely day outside."
>With that, the two of you get ready, and then depart.
>Another automated hovercraft picks you up, and heads along towards the city, barreling along at worrying speeds.
>Seeing your mild discomfort, Subina wraps an arm around you protectively, smiling benevolently.
>Before long, you arrive at your destination.
>The city is bustling today. Men and women of all shapes and sizes wander the streets, some pointing at you and waving, others staring in confusion.
>There are even a few Caithians in the mix, wearing helmets and apparently... staring at anything that catches their eye.
>Subina places a hand on your shoulder.
>"What would you like to see, Anon? I am sure there are many things you would be interested in."

>"Hm. Are there any museums or anything like that around? It'd be interesting to learn something about Nocten's history."
>"Ah, of course. There is one not too far from here."
>She takes your hand and leads you down the street.
>It really is a nice day. The air is refreshingly cool and crisp, almost like a fall day back on Earth. Some people nod and acknowledge you, others don't seem to notice your presence.
>Eventually, you arrive at the museum. As expected, the interior is very minimalist. A young woman stands near the entrance, and smiles widely when she sees Subina.
>"Ah, hello, Admiral! Here to reminisce, I suppose?"
>"Err, not quite. I have a guest today."
>"So I see. Well, go on in; you know you don't have to worry about admission."
>Subina thanks the lady, and the two of you enter the museum proper.
>There are quite a few exhibits, including a hall of portraits, some photographs of what seem to be earlier versions of the Palace...
>...and some wartime photos. Subina pointedly avoids these, and you follow suit.
>"Let me show you something."
>She leads you down the hall of portraits. Each one shows a Nocterran woman clad in a silver tiara. The last portrait on the wall is... Fernetis.
>"These are all the Empresses that Nocten has had throughout the years."
>There are easily hundreds of portraits...
>Subina points at a few of them, sharing some interesting factoids.
>Eventually, she seems to exhaust her trivia, and leads you to another display.
>This one shows what seems to be... a jump drive? Your fiancée practically beams at it.
>"This is the very first working prototype of a jump drive. Our technology has come a long way since then. As Mother said, many advancements in jump tech specifically are tied to her work."
>"I'm sure you're very proud of her."
>"I could not be prouder of my parents."
>She smiles warmly at the prototype.

>After she reminisces for a while, Subina leads you to another exhibit. This one seems to show off some other races Nocten has contact with.
>There's a picture of one of the past Empresses speaking with some sort of snake person. Another shows a very ratlike individual speaking to an Empress.
>None of the pictures show any race you're familiar with, of course. Subina smiles and lays a hand on your shoulder.
>"Soon, an image of you and Fernetis will be here. Imagine: you, a part of Nocten's history... how wonderful."
>"Well, you're part of it too, Subina."
>One particularly large image catches your eye...
>It shows a group of Nocterrans approaching what seem to be... Caithians.
>"What's this one?"
>"That is an image of Nocten's very first contact with another race. It was a very momentous occasion, to say the least."
>"So you've been in touch with them a long time... interesting."
>She smiles again.
>"Toldrum is an ally of Nocten, right? You're all friends?"
>"Well, yes and no. They are officially neutral, but they are not hostile to us."
>"Ah, I see. Speaking of friends, do you have any other close ones besides Fernetis?"
>"A few, yes. I do not get to talk to them often though..."
>She frowns momentarily, and you immediately hug her tightly. Her frown slowly vanishes, and she returns your gesture.

>"Say, is there an exhibit on observation equipment? That'd be interesting to see."
>"Ah, I believe there is one around here somewhere."
>She leads you off to a room full of vaguely recognizable equipment. At least SOME of it looks remotely like Earth tech?
>...okay yeah, you got nothing.
>Subina points out a few things of note and explains them, making sure you understand.
>"If I want to work in this field, I'll have to learn about this stuff."
>"Not to worry. I am certain that your colleagues will help you out."
>"You think so?"
>"Of course. They will certainly be understanding of your situation. After all... not all researchers are Nocterrans. Explaining our tech is likely a large part of their work."
>"Yeah, that makes sense."
>"Does any of it look familiar?"
>"...maybe a little?"
>"Mm. More coincidental similarities. Mother will likely do quite a lot of research into these parallels..."
>"It is kinda interesting. Though, despite them, Nocten is still pretty different in several ways..."
>As the two of you ponder things, you gently, unconsciously drift closer to her. When she notices, she smiles and takes hold of your hand, interlacing her fingers with yours.
>Her tail swishes happily as the two of you examine the various bits of equipment.

>Standing next to her, enjoying her company, you decide to ask the big question.
>"...Subina, when exactly is the wedding happening? And where, for that matter?"
>She smiles and squeezes you tightly.
>"In two days, and... I've gotten permission to have it in the Palace."
>Her eyes practically light up.
>"I cannot tell you how excited I am. I hope you are ready, Anon."
>"I am absolutely ready. I can't wait."
>"Neither can I."
>The two of you share another smile.
>"I've really enjoyed the museum, but what do you say we see some more of the town? Anywhere you like to go in particular?"
>"Hm... perhaps you would like to get something to eat?"
>"Sounds good to me. Lead the way; I'm sure you know what's good around here."
>She nods, and the two of you leave the museum. She leads you through the crowded streets carefully, and eventually into a rather small, quiet cafe.
>Surprisingly, despite the bustling streets outside, very few people are in here. An obviously elderly gentleman stands behind the counter, smiling warmly.
>"Ah, hello again, Admiral. Always a pleasure to have our best customer in. And who's this fellow?"
>"Hello, Ar. This is Anon, my fiancée."
>The man turns his smile over to you.
>"Well, it's a pleasure to meet you, Anon. What can I do for you two today?"

>Unsure what to get, you scan over the menu. Subina translates everything for you patiently as Ar chuckles.
>"Can't read Nocterran yet, eh? That's alright. Everyone needs time to learn. Where are you from, son?"
>"Uh, Earth. It's a long way from here."
>He nods sagely.
>"I see. Always nice to have someone from another planet in. You're the first from a planet I haven't heard of in quite some time. Do you mind terribly if I take a picture, for posterity?"
>"Of course not; go right ahead."
>Ar smiles appreciatively, then his right eye seems to flash white. He extends a hand, and you shake it.
>"Thank you, son. Admiral, you and your fellow pick whatever you like; it's on me today."
>Subina is momentarily taken aback.
>"Ar, you do not have to do that. I am more than capable of paying."
>He scoffs and waves a hand dismissively.
>"I'm well aware. Don't worry your pretty head about it. I think I can spare two meals for my most frequent visitor and her fiancée."
>She sighs.
>"Very well. I would like the usual, please."
>You shrug.
>"I guess I'll try what she's having."
>Ar nods, already heading back into the kitchen.
>"I'll bring them out soon as they're ready. You two have a seat, I'll send out some drinks in a moment."
>You and Subina sit down at a nearby table, and almost immediately a hovering drone brings two glasses of some purple beverage. She affectionately pats the drone's top, and it flies off.
>You take a cautious sip of your drink...
>It's not bad; the taste kinda reminds you of some cheap off brand dollar store grape soda. The kind that you'd only think tastes like grape if you'd never eaten a grape in your entire life. Subina grins at you.
>"How do you like it?"
>"It's nice, thanks."
>"Wonderful. There is no better drink than Ar's homemade sodas."
>...hm. While it's not fantastic by any means, you at least have to give the man credit for making it himself.

>While you wait for your food, you decide to make some small talk.
>"So, have you always lived around this city?"
>"Yes, I have. Mother and Father live on the opposite side of the city. But, we have always been here."
>"I see. How often do you come here?"
>"I visit Ar's cafe every time I am home from my work. So, fairly often."
>"What's your usual, exactly?"
>"It is Ar's specialty: a sandwich of his own design, with a secret recipe. It is a shame more people do not come here... I love his cooking."
>"Does he do it all by hand?"
>"Yes, which is a rarity thanks to machines like Ren. I find it refreshing to have a meal lovingly cooked by hand sometimes."
>"I can see that."
>The elderly chef steps out of the kitchen with an awkward smile.
>"Err... it'll be a little while longer. Sorry for the inconvenience."
>Subina smiles patiently.
>"Take your time, Ar. We are in no rush."
>"Thanks for your patience, Admiral. My ol' grill isn't wanting to cooperate today."
>With that, he shuffles back into the depths of the cafe.

>Winking at Subina, you start up some footsies under the table. She soon catches on and plays along, giggling a little.
>"So, will I need to get fitted for a suit?"
>"Tomorrow, yes. I have already arranged to meet a tailor."
>"Alright then. You said you liked home cooking... I'd be happy to cook some Earth style food for you."
>"Really? I would like that."
>"You'll have to tell me what ingredients to use as substitutes, of course. But I'd be more than happy to learn."
>"Thank you, Anon. I am certain you will catch on quickly."
>Ar emerges from the kitchen, proudly carrying a tray with two fairly large sandwiches on it.
>"There we are; enjoy, you two."
>With that, he bows and retreats to the counter.
>You tentatively take a bite of the now-cold sandwich (presumably Nocterrans have some way of cooling even freshly cooked food quickly?), and are pleased to find...
>It's perfectly delicious. You can't place the flavor, but it's definitely the best Nocterran food you've had.
>Ar notices your enjoyment and smiles proudly.
>You quickly polish off the rest of the sandwich, washing it down with the ice cold soda.
>Subina chuckles, having barely made a dent in her sandwich.
>"You must have been hungry. Did you like it?"
>"Yes, I did; I'm glad we came here."
>"As am I. I am happy to see you enjoying some non-Earth food."
>Well, you have to get used to it eventually. Not like you can run out to the Wal-Mart or anything...
>Subina smiles at you, then at Ar as she takes a bite of her lunch, tail swishing and ears twitching happily.

>As Subina continues to finish off her lunch, Ar walks over to you, smiling.
>"Did you like it, son?"
>You nod vigorously, and he chuckles.
>"People say I make the best sandwich in Khetantae. Well... mainly my VIP customer..."
>He winks and claps a hand on your fiancée's shoulder. She smiles.
>"I say that because it is true, Ar. You are a wonderful chef."
>The old man grins bashfully.
>"Aww, thank you, Admiral. Say, you two want some dessert?"
>"Oh, that is not necess-"
>Before Subina finishes her sentence, the old chef dashes off, returning with two small slices of what is obviously a cake.
>"On the house. Enjoy, you two."
>Taking a shine to the old fellow, you motion for him to sit down. He complies without hesitation.
>"Ar, this stuff is fantastic. I thought you might wanna talk Earth cooking; seems like something you'd be interested in."
>His eyes widen.
>"Oooh, I'd like to hear that, son."
>So, you launch into a discussion of some of your favorite recipes. Ar nods vigorously and smiles the whole time.
>You take a bite of the cake...
>It's very moist, and has a vaguely fruity taste. It's surprisingly not all that sweet, given most Nocterran food. Ar grins wider when he sees your own smile.
>"Mm, that's great too."
>Ar smiles nostalgically.
>"My wife made the recipe for that. Bless her. She don't live around here anymore. Moved to Toldrum for work. She keeps in touch, but I miss her, boy."
>His ears droop sadly.

>"Ar, if you don't mind my asking, what does your wife do?"
>"Oh, I don't mind. She's a Caithian herself, and she's one of their Observers. A pretty high ranked one at that."
>"Observer?"
>"Mhm. They're responsible for watching and studying worlds Toldrum wants to learn about. She's pretty good at it too, if I say so myself."
>"You didn't move with her?"
>"Naw... I decided to stay here with the ol' cafe. She'll be home soon. It's not that unusual for Caithians to do that sort of thing."
>"Hm."
>"She's had to move home a few times since we got married... it still pains me to see her go every time. But, as they say, absence makes the heart grow fonder. I still love her as much as I did when she came down the aisle in that green dress..."
>He smiles wistfully, a tear welling up in his eye.
>"...aw, I'm rambling now. Don't mind me, Anon. Just a sentimental ol' man, reminiscing on his busy wife."
>"You aren't bothering me; sometimes it's nice to talk about that kind of thing."
>"Mm, it can be, yes. Thanks for lending this chef your ears, son."
>"Think nothing of it, Ar."
>He smiles again, as does Subina, staring at you lovingly. She mouths "thank you."

>"Say, Ar... is it too personal for me to ask how you met your wife?"
>He smiles warmly.
>"Why, of course not. I'd love to tell ya how I met Fae. I was visiting Toldrum, trying to learn some new recipes for my then-new cafe. The locals pointed me to the best restaurant in the town of Kellofor, and that's where it happened."
>He sighs dreamily.
>"My eyes met hers, and it was love at first sight. I think. I wasn't too good at reading Caithians back then. Anyway, I was smitten. So, I started talking to her. Asked about the restaurant, how long she'd been cooking there, if she was single..."
>He chuckles.
>"Heh, heheh, that last one got me a good scratch across the face! But I didn't give up. Over the span of my year long visit to Toldrum, I went there every day. Caithians ain't so good at social things, but I could tell she was trying her best. Y'see, they usually only have a theoretical knowledge of how to interact with a new species. I was one of the first Nocterrans she ever spoke to! Bless her, she led off with a head pat. Ah, she didn't know any better, the poor gal!"
>He pauses for a moment, reminiscing.
>"Anyway, eventually, Fae confided in me that she hated working at the restaurant; said her boss was insufferable. So, I offered her a job at my cafe, and she accepted. 'On one condition. Mya.' She said. 'Marry me. Mya.' And it's been paradise ever since."
>"Wait, how'd she become an Observer then?"
>"The Queen of Toldrum came by. Adored Fae's cooking and her analytical gaze. So, she promoted Fae on the spot, and she has served as an Observer from that day on."
>"Oh, I see."
>...something comes to mind.
>"Ar, it may be sudden, but I'd like to invite you and Fae to our wedding."
>"W- really? Why, thank you, son. Admiral? You alright with this ol' chef coming along?"
>"Of course, Ar. You are a friend."
>He smiles toothily.
>"I'll have to get in touch with Fae...!"

>With that, you and your fiancée bid the chef farewell. He waves as you leave, then excitedly dashes into the kitchen, presumably to call Fae.
>"That was very nice of you, Anon."
>"He seemed like a good guy. Hope that inviting him was okay?"
>"Of course. Ar is a friend."
>"Great. Where to now?"
>"I noticed you had trouble reading Nocterran. How about we go purchase a pair of integrated eyeglasses so Grape can translate text for you?"
>"Oh, that sounds great. That way you don't have to read things off for me."
>She pats your back with a smile.
>"Not that I mind doing that, of course."
>"I know you don't. But it'd be nice to have those glasses regardless."
>Subina chuckles and leads you off to another store.
>This one is very crowded, especially in comparison to Ar's barren cafe. Nocterran men and women of all ages and shapes mill about, browsing.
>A holographic avatar stands at the rear of the shop, smiling. It doesn't seem to be an offshoot of VHL for once.
>Instead, this one is a male Nocterran resembling Fernetis's butler. He bows deeply when you approach.
>"Afternoon, sir. Madame. How can I be of service?"
>"Uhh... we're looking for integrated glasses?"
>"Fine choice. Let me show you our styles..."
>After an hour or two passes, you and Subina exit the store. Your new glasses fit very well, and Grape's face appears in one corner of your vision, smiling and winking.

>Testing out the integration of your glasses, you speak to Grape.
>"Could you make the UI resemble the Enterprise's?"
>"Of course. One moment."
>The various UI bits in your vision vanish, soon to return as replicas of the Enterprise computers' UI. You smile broadly, your inner sci-fi enthusiast enjoying himself very much.
>"Thanks, Grape."
>The avatar smiles and nods. You turn to Subina, who's watching you, amused.
>"So, do they make me look more handsome~?"
>Her expression becomes stern.
>"No."
>...a grin slowly breaks out across her face.
>"...you are perfectly handsome with or without them."
>She pulls you into a quick hug.
>"Thank you. Where do you wanna go next?"
>"Hmm. Would you like to see a place that is very near to my heart?"
>"Of course I would. Lead the way."
>She grabs your hand and sets out walking through the crowded streets.
>Eventually, you find yourself leaving town. Confused, you speak up.
>"Err, where are we going?"
>"It is a surprise."
>Fair enough.
>She leads you out of town, and up a large hill. It's startlingly reminiscent of Halley's Hill back on Earth... it's even pleasantly grassy. Albeit, the grass is purple...
>The two of you climb up and over the hill, eventually reaching what seems to be her destination.
>Subina smiles serenely as she performs a sweeping gesture.
>"Here we are."
>It's beautiful. All manner of alien plants grow around you. Everything is quiet and peaceful, the hustle of Khetantae nearly inaudible.
>Subina has led you to what is essentially an all-natural park or garden.
>She sighs happily and takes a seat on the ground. You sit next to her, and she immediately throws an arm around you.
>"Is it not beautiful? I come here when I need to relax."
>"It's gorgeous. I can see how this place relaxes you."
>She smiles and squeezes you tightly.

>"We should come back here with a picnic lunch sometime."
>"That would be nice. Good idea, Anon."
>The two of you then sink into silence, enjoying the tranquil beauty of your surroundings.
>Subina leans against you despite being taller, and you hold her up gently.
>After a while of peace, you break the silence with a question.
>"Subina, how often will you be out on service? For how long?"
>She sighs. Not sadly, nor out of frustration. It's merely a sigh.
>"Frequency depends on many factors. Should not be too often though. Duration is also variable, but typically no longer than a month."
>She smiles apologetically, then suddenly adopts a stern expression.
>"Anon. I know you are a capable man, and will be remaining home with VHL and Grape. I want to ask you one thing. Though you may desire to come with me, or help me, do not attempt to join the Nocterran military. I will see to it that that never happens. I do not want you to experience the things I have. Can you promise me that much?"
>"I... yes. I swear I won't try to enlist. For you."
>She nods, and her frown softens back into a peaceful smile.
>"Good, thank you. Let us just enjoy the peace."
>She gives you a kiss on the cheek.
>"I love you, Anon."
>"Love you too, Subina."
>Another peck on the cheek blossoms into a passionate kiss. The two of you remain there, lips locked, for what feels like a lifetime of happiness.
>When the kiss ends, the two of you lay back in the grass, staring up at the Nocterran sky...

>...after a long while of just enjoying the beauty of your surroundings, you roll over to face Subina.
>"Subina... I had a thought."
>"Mm? What was it?"
>She stares at you with those lavender eyes as you take a deep breath.
>"...do you want to start a family some day?"
>Her jaw drops slightly. There's a long pause, after which she smiles.
>"...I do not know if that is entirely possible, at least the way you are thinking. That being said..."
>She scoots close and wraps her arms around you.
>"I love you, Anon. I would be honored to start a family with you some day, even if it took some creative thinking."
>"You mean that? Thank you, Subina. That means a lot to me."
>Her smile widens, and she pulls you even closer, burying your face in the fur of her neck.
>"I hope you know how much you mean to me, Anon. Though we have not known each other long, I feel as if we are already so... close. As if the two of us were, as cliche as it may be to say, meant to be together."
>She begins patting your back affectionately.
>"I do not entirely believe in fate, but I cannot deny that our meeting was perfect. If I had met any other human that day... I do not know if I would be here and alive today. Even if I did make it back to Nocten, I would not have someone like you by my side."
>She squeezes you even tighter.
>"Someone so very kind, so loving and understanding. I have said this again and again, but that changes nothing; I love you, Anon."
>You attempt to tell her the same, but it comes out muffled, and you get a mouthful of purple fur for your efforts. She relaxes her grip with a small chuckle.
>"I love you too. And I mean that earnestly."
>The two of you share a warm smile, then return to watching the sky. She speaks airily.
>"After this, we will have to begin preparing for the wedding."
>Oh yeah, that's in two days.
>Wait.
>TWO DAYS?

>Excitement and mild panic wash over you.
>"Uh... what do we need to do to get prepared?"
>She nonchalantly waves a hand.
>"Mm, check the list of individuals we want to invite, have Grape or VHL send out invitations, get you fitted for a suit, I need to get fitted for a dress..."
>Her casual attitude starts to fade, as the same excitement and panic starts to hit her.
>"...we have quite a lot to do, actually. We... should probably head back to the city and get started."
>With that, the two of you hop up and make your way back to Khetantae, arriving after a short, uneventful hike.
>"Okay, let's think about the list. Your parents, Empress Fernetis, the rescue squad members, Ar and Fae... am I missing anyone?"
>"I believe that is everyone we have spoken to about it. Of course, there will be more, but I will handle that."
>"Okay. Now, what exactly will I have to do? As in, things directly involving me."
>"For the ceremony itself, you merely have to give a short talk on our relationship. That is all. After that, it is simply a matter of talking with friends and family members, and of course the traditional dance with your- well, in this case, my mother."
>"That's all?"
>"That is all. Nocterran weddings are simple, intimate affairs."
>"Good, good. ...say, how will my race be publicized?"
>"Likely... a few days after the wedding. There will be a press conference, where I will give a short statement on what occurred on Earth and who you are."
>She smiles.
>"Not to worry, they will be fascinated by you."
>"Oh, alright then. What do we need to do now?"
>"Hm. Well, we could see about getting some decor... there is a shop around here somewhere..."
>She puts a hand to her chin in thought.
>"One moment. I will go ask the AI in the tech store if he can give me directions."
>She heads back into the store. While she's gone, you have Grape send a special request to her mother...

>...after buying some decorations (all purple, of course), you and Subina exit the store.
>"Alright, what now?"
>"Well, I have arranged for your suit fitting tomorrow... though I suppose I could get my own fitting taken care of today."
>"Not a bad idea."
>With that, the two of you head off to a dress shop.
>The entire shop is packed full of dresses in various styles and shades of purple, with a few other colors mixed in. Most notably green.
>A Caithian woman approaches, helmet obscuring her face. Luckily, as Grape informed you during the setup of your integrated glasses, your translator finally downloaded Caithian.
>"Ah, hello. Mya. How can I help you. Mrow."
>"I am here for a wedding dress."
>"Ah, splendid. Meowl. Let me show you some of our most popular styles. Mya."
>The shorter feline takes your fiancée's hand and leads her off into the shop. You take a seat on a nearby stool. Another Caithian woman steps out from a back room.
>"Do you need anything. Mrow."
>"Uh... no thanks; just waiting on my fiancée."
>"Very well. Mya. I'm here if you need something, or get bored waiting. Mya."
>"Thank you, miss..."
>"Selk. Mya."
>"Miss Selk."
>The strange alien seems to stare at you silently.
>"Where are you from. Mrow."
>"Oh, uh... a long ways away."
>"Fair enough. Mya."
>She chuckles flatly.

>An hour passes, and there's no sign of Subina. You sigh, and the Caithian chuckles again.
>"Bored, aren't you. Mrow."
>"...a little, yes."
>"How would you like to help me with something. Mrow."
>"Sure, I'd be glad to."
>She motions for you to follow her, and leads you to a closed door.
>"Now, are you certain you don't mind. Mrow."
>"I'm sure."
>She nods and steps forward. The door opens...
>And your jaw drops.
>There, sitting on the floor, are easily 20 Caithian kittens. They're about the size of a large dog, and bear wiry, deep green fur.
>Rather than helmets, they bear what seem to be rebreather masks, which make rather unnerving sounds.
>Most striking, however, are the eyes.
>Each kit has massive, pale green eyes with slit pupils, surrounded by much smaller eyes of varying colors. They don't seem to blink, and they are all affixed on you. It's very unnerving, to say the least.
>"Children, this nice gentleman has come to see you. Mya."
>Immediately, the air is filled with a cacophony of meowing as the kids swarm you.
>In an instant, you collapse to the floor, drowning in fur.
>The sheer volume of their purring drowns out all other sounds, even rendering their mother inaudible when she speaks up.
>You can't deny it's comfortable though. The little kits are warm and fuzzy. Though the steady, unsettling rhythm of their masks keeps you from getting TOO cozy.
>You keep them entertained for a good while, when you hear the door open.
>There's a gasp, and you turn around...
>You see Subina, standing at the door with a hand over her mouth. Her eyes practically glitter with adoration.
>"Miss Selk, are these your children?"
>"Yes, they are, Admiral. Mya."
>"They are wonderful. Such beautiful eyes on them."
>"Thank you. Meowl. They take after their father. Mya."
>The kits hop off you and charge your fiancée. She stoops down and practically melts, smiling ear to ear and fawning over the kits.

>Though some of them moved over to Subina, most of the kits are still piled on top of you. They purr, mew, and breath heavily, making it difficult to hear anything.
>"Uh, Subina, could you give me a hand, please?"
>She chuckles and grabs your hand, pulling you up from the floor. Once you're standing, you gently pet the kits' heads. Their fur is almost uncomfortably wiry...
>Selk laughs flatly.
>"Okay children, let the nice man go. Mya."
>The kits comply, stepping back and staring with those massive eyes. You and Subina exit the room, with her waving goodbye to the children.
>Selk stays behind, so you lean in and whisper to Subina.
>"Do Nocterran women have that many children?"
>"Ah, no. Usually 4 at the absolute most. 2 is the average."
>"Oh, alright. I saw how wide you smiled when you saw them. Imagine: we could have something like that some day."
>"Yes... we... we certainly could."
>She's clearly in deep thought, smiling with a hand to her chin...

<Subina>

>She had a soft spot for children (especially Caithian kits, they're adorable), but Subina had never considered having her own.
>And yet, here Anon was, suggesting they start a family some day.
>Dr. Kehs had said it was most likely medically impossible. That humans and Nocterrans simply weren't compatible for breeding.
>Regardless, if she and Anon wanted a family, she would find a way.
>...but did she really want that...?
>With her service, she couldn't spend as much time with a child as she'd like. But...
>It was a lot to consider.

<Anon>

>While she thinks, you walk up to the counter to see what dress she picked out. The Caithian clerk pushes you away when you attempt to look.
>"Bad luck. Mya. Wait until the wedding. Meowl."
>"Okay, okay. Sorry."
>She nods roughly. Subina snaps out of her distracted state and pays for the dress, smiling.

>As the two of you exit the dress shop, Subina smiles and waves goodbye to the two women working inside.
>"That went well; I hope you like it... What did you think of the kits?"
>"Uh..."
>She chuckles.
>"That is what I expected. The first time you see a Caithian's eyes is something you never forget."
>"Are they... all like that?"
>"Well, there are variants in eye color, but otherwise yes."
>"Oh. Uh, okay then."
>She chuckles again, and her stomach growls.
>"Hm. Anon, I believe we can finish preparations tomorrow. How about we head home?"
>"Sure thing, I can try cooking some dinner."
>"Ooh, that sounds nice. I will have to show you some ingredients and what Earth food they might equate to."
>Using your PDA, you call for an automated hovercraft to take you back to Subina's house. It arrives in only a few minutes, and before you know it, you're there.
>Upon entering the house, you are greeted by VHL's holographic avatar. Heather smiles.
>"Ah, hello, Anon. Admiral. You're both looking well."
>A message appears in the view of your glasses.
>"We got the mint ice cream recipe set up. It'll be there at the reception."
>You discretely meet Heather's gaze and nod.
>Subina claps a hand onto your shoulder.
>"Are you ready to try making some Nocterran cooking?"
>"Sure thing."
>She leads you to the kitchen with a smile. 
>As expected, you recognize practically nothing barring those same minty mushrooms. Hm.
>What's going to be the best thing to cook here...?

>You quickly scan the very minimalistic kitchen. Some of the appliances are familiar enough to work out what they are, others are more enigmatic.
>"...okay, I don't recognize anything but the mushrooms. Care to give me a hand?"
>Subina chuckles.
>"Certainly."
>She points out several of the ingredients, revealing that some are vegetables, some fruits, others mushrooms. She opens up what seems to be an advanced fridge, and shows off various types of meat.
>"Does that help?"
>"Yes it does, thanks. Now, can you tell me how some of this stuff tastes?"
>"Mm. Let's see. What are you planning to cook?"
>"Err... maybe something like a steak and baked potato?"
>"Hm. I believe you will want Sohru meat and perhaps... hm. Perhaps some of these."
>She indicates an assortment of mushrooms, these flat capped and dark in color.
>"Uh... huh. How do these taste?"
>"Rather bland and earthy. Good for side dishes."
>"Oh, great; not too far off from a potato."
>"I am afraid I do not know if they are all that similar. Remember, our senses of taste are rather different."
>"True, but as long as it works for you, I'm happy."
>She smiles and kisses you on the cheek. You then start cooking.
>Despite being from a bird(?) the meat is very similar to beef. The mushrooms are amazingly similar to potatoes, so you actually don't have much trouble at all preparing dinner.
>After getting everything cooked, you serve the food hot. Subina smiles politely, but clears her throat.
>"This smells wonderful... but it is too hot for me to eat."
>"Oops, sorry."
>"Not to worry. Observe."
>She leads you to a strange machine in the kitchen. She inserts her plate, and presses a button. After a short delay, the machine opens back up, and she removes her now-chilled dinner.
>"There we are. I look forward to trying this, Anon. Thank you for cooking."
>"No problem. Hope you like it."
>"I am sure I will."
>With that, the two of you take your seats at the table.

>Smiling to hide your hesitance to try your own cooking, you watch Subina take a bite.
>She smiles widely, teeth glinting in the light.
>"Oh, this is excellent. Especially for your first try. ...though it is admittedly a little unusual, flavor wise."
>"Really? Lemme try..."
>Tentatively, you try a small bite of the Sohru steak...
>As expected, it's a bit sweet, as it was when Ren cooked some for you. But, it seems the spices you used have dulled that sweetness a bit. Not the best thing you've ever eaten, but certainly not bad.
>Then, you try the side of mushrooms.
>...they're almost overwhelmingly salty. To the point you imagine that the water of the Dead Sea wouldn't scratch these.
>Still, you choke them down with a little grin. Luckily you have a drink, or eating them would be a much harder prospect.
>Subina apparently picks up on your hidden discomfort, and frowns slightly.
>"..is something the matter?"
>"Huh? Oh, uh... it's nothing much. The food just tastes different from what I expected."
>She chuckles, frown vanishing.
>"Oh, I figured as such. How do they taste to you?"
>"Like pure salt."
>"Really? Interesting. With the seasoning you used, they are pleasantly spicy to me."
>"Hm. What about the meat?"
>"A bit... hm. Hard to describe, really. Different, I suppose. Sort of an eclectic mix of flavors."
>"Huh. Interesting."
>"I like your cooking; I believe you did a very good job for a first timer."
>"Thanks. I just need to get used to Nocterran food, I guess."
>"It will come with time."
>She smiles and takes another bite of the steak.

>"So, what's your favorite thing to eat? I could try learning how to cook it..."
>"Hm. I am rather fond of Ar's sandwiches... though I suppose my favorite dish is grilled Mehit."
>"Grilled, uh... what, now?"
>"Mm, they are aquatic creatures; I believe the closest equivalent on Earth would be the shark? Perhaps?"
>"Sh- you eat those?"
>She nods vigorously.
>"They are wonderful grilled, especially with a light dusting of spices... I do not eat it often though."
>"Alright. I'll do my best to learn how to cook that for you."
>A loving smile spreads across her face, and she rises from her chair. She walks over to you and stoops down.
>"You would do that, just to make me happy?"
>"Of course I would."
>She hugs you tightly, squeezing you affectionately.
>"You are so kind. This is why I love you."
>She releases you and scoots back a little. The two of you share a smile, then a thought hits you.
>"Subina... I'm still thinking about a future family. Could we adopt, if it came to that?"
>"That is a possibility, yes. Though I do wonder if there may be another solution..."
>"Hm? Like what?"
>She waves a hand nonchalantly.
>"Do not worry about it. It was just a thought."
>"Oh, uh... okay."
>Thinking about starting a family brings your own family to mind.
>You and your parents didn't really get along well. It wasn't a BAD relationship, but you all kind of just... agreed to cut ties mutually.
>You've been happier ever since, really. It'll be different to have Siris and Namet around. Seems that they're close to Subina, and will likely be close to you as well.
>At any rate, Namet likes you enough to be willing to substitute your mother in the wedding ceremony. And Siris didn't kill you for getting engaged to his daughter.
>So, at least the in-laws seem nice.

>Once you finish dinner, you and Subina quickly clean up the table and kitchen.
>You begin to notice that she's quietly humming some classical music to herself, gently swaying to her own music and smiling serenely.
>Once you finish cleaning up, the two of you head into the living room, where Subina sits next to you on the couch, still humming.
>"Say, I have an idea... how about I brush your fur again?"
>She smiles and lets out a little gasp.
>"Ooh... I would love that. Can you put on some music, as well?"
>"Of course I can."
>"Wonderful."
>You dash off to grab the brush you packed, when you return, you start the music up.
>You sit next to Subina, and slowly, gently begin brushing her lush purple fur. She immediately sighs in contentment, closing her eyes happily.
>She sways back and forth to the rhythm of the music, her ears and tail twitching joyfully. Her tongue gently pokes out of her mouth.
>She very quietly speaks.
>"Mmm... thank you, Anon..."
>You redouble your efforts, and she practically dissolves. She relaxes considerably, slowly collapsing across your lap.
>Once she's lying there, you go for the kill.
>You take your free hand and begin gently rubbing her ears. Their incredible softness mystifies you a little, and she seems to enjoy it considerably. 
>Subina continues to speak, very quietly.
>"Mmm... you... I am so comfortable... feeling... a little...."
>She drifts off to sleep, snoring quietly after a few minutes. You continue to play with her ears and brush her, smiling down at her.
>You whisper, even though you know she's fully asleep.
>"Love you, Subina."
>She shifts in her sleep a little, smiling vaguely.

>After continuing to rub and brush her for a while, you yawn.
>It's been quite a day. And tomorrow promises to be busy as well.
>Placing an arm beneath her back, and another under her legs, you lift Subina delicately. Luckily she's not as heavy as her stature would suggest.
>You carry her to bed, and gently lay her down. She almost immediately burrows into the soft mattress, smiling subconsciously.
>You quickly get ready for bed, then climb in next to her.
>You snuggle up as close to her as possible, and wrap an arm around her midsection.
>Her quiet snoring quickly lulls you to sleep.
>Just as you fall asleep, her tail drapes itself over you. You smile vaguely at nothing in particular, then collapse entirely into sleep.
>You don't dream much this time. There's a very brief snippet of an imaginary wedding scene, but otherwise your mind is blank.
>That's okay. Sometimes it's nice to just sleep uninterrupted.
>Tomorrow is gonna be hectic...

>While you don't dream, your mind does wander a bit. Mainly, you mentally weigh the idea of starting a family.
>Your own family wasn't all that close, but it's clear that Subina's is. It's apparent that Namet and Siris are loving, caring parents, and you're certain they'd love to have grandkids.
>But your main reasoning is more straightforward than that.
>Subina has been through a lot. Having a family, one that can love and support her, could give her the normality she desperately deserves. Your thoughts of starting a family all come down to making her happy.

<Subina>

>Subina smiled in her sleep. Her dreams had taken on a comfy atmosphere since she proposed to Anon.
>She was thankful to have these dreams; they were preferable to her old dreams in every possible way.
>Tonight, her mind conjured up something she'd been thinking about a lot:
>Starting a family.
>When Anon mentioned it, it completely blindsided her. But...
>She wasn't opposed to the idea. Not at all.
>Despite knowing it likely wasn't possible, her dream played around with the idea of her and Anon producing a child naturally.
>Unfortunately... her imagination apparently decided to take the night off.
>The child never really appeared clearly in her mind. That said, she knew it was undeniably hers.
>Just before the dream ended, she finally noticed one detail...
>He had his father's eyes...

>Subina yawned as she awoke. She smiled when she realized that Anon had carried her to bed.
>His sweetness never ceased to amaze her. She carefully got out of bed, making sure not to wake him up.
>She quietly left the bedroom, and headed into the kitchen, where VHL's avatar was working on breakfast. Lilac smiled at her user.
>"Good morning; sleep well?"
>Subina yawned and nodded drowsily.
>"Good. You've got a lot to do today; we took the liberty of making a list. It'll be on your PDA, and we sent a copy to Grape as well."
>"Mm. Thank you, VHL."
>"Our pleasure!"

>A thought came to her groggy mind.
>"Actually... VHL, I will handle breakfast."
>"Hm? As you wish, Admiral."
>The holographic avatar stepped back from her cooking and gestured for Subina to take her place.
>"Thank you. It is not that I do not enjoy your cooking; I just want to surprise Anon."
>"Oh, that's sweet! I'm sure he'll be pleased."
>Subina grunted vaguely and nodded.
>She wasn't the best cook, and never had been. That being said... at least VHL had gotten a decent start.
>It was a traditional recipe, one Subina had known for a good while, but she still struggled with it.
>Wait, was this supposed to cook for 5 minutes or 15...?
>Hm. Better go with 15, just to be safe.
>While the food cooked, she headed back to wake Anon.
>When she entered the bedroom, he was snoring quietly, an arm dangling off the side of the bed.
>She knelt down and took his hand into hers.
>"Anon... Anon..."
>He merely smiled in his sleep, squeezing her hand. She returned the favor, gently tightening her grip.
>"Wake up, Anon..."
>Still no response.
>...a deeper part of her mind gave her an idea.
>She smiled mischievously as she lowered herself even further. She carefully removed her shirt, and leaned close to Anon...
>Before suddenly placing a hand on the back of his head and burying his face in her chest.
>She stifled a little moan, and chuckled when he finally woke up.
>"Huh? What the- S-Subina? What's going on?"
>She released her grip on him, then giggled as she redressed herself.
>"Good morning!"

>"Why did you... nevermind. Lemme get dressed real quick."
>"Take your time; I made breakfast."
>He nodded with a drowsy smile, and Subina rushed off to check on her cooking.
>VHL stood by the stove, shaking her heads with grim expressions.
>The food was... very burnt.
>Subina sighed, but still served up breakfast. Anon, now dressed, stepped into the dining room...
>He blinked at the scorched food in shock. Subina cringed.
>"...I am sorry. I did not remember how long to cook them."
>He smiled sympathetically.
>"That's okay. Thanks for cooking."
>He took a bite out of the burnt pastry, and smiled unconvincingly. It touched Subina that he cared enough about her happiness to force down what was obviously borderline inedible.
>She absentmindedly took a bite of her own cooking, and nearly spat it out in disgust.
>It was burnt to such a degree that it tasted like nothing more than a stone. She sighed, a little disappointed with herself.
>"So, what's on the agenda today?"
>"Many things. Your appointment for your fitting is soon, so we should leave once you are finished."
>"Gotcha."
>He smiled again, and Subina returned the favor. She loved his grin; it was infectious.

>Anon choked down another bite of the ill-fated breakfast.
>"Anon, you do not have to eat that.  We can get something else in town."
>"Huh?  I-it's not so bad, really."
>He smiled again, unconvincingly.
>"...I know it is bad.  You do not have to pretend it is not."
>He sighed.
>"Okay.  I'm sorry, Subina."
>"Do not be; I am not much of a cook."
>He rose from his chair and hugged her.
>"That's alright.  I still love you anyway."
>Subina wrapped her arms around him, and stooped slightly.  She pulled him into a kiss, then the two broke apart.
>"I love you too, Anon.  However... we need to leave now.  There are many things we need to do today."
>"That's true.  Let's go, then."
>The couple exited Subina's home, and called a hovercraft.  Within minutes, they arrived in Khetantae.
>Anon shook his head, laughing.
>"It's gonna take a while to get used to those things."
>"I am rather fond of them, myself."
>Subina led her fiancée to the tailor's shop, and suddenly halted in her tracks just outside the shop.
>"Hm?  Why'd we stop?"
>"It is bad luck for me to see your suit before the ceremony, and this shop likely has no waiting room.  I will wait for you out here."
>"...won't you be bored?"
>"Of course not.  If I do get tired of waiting, I will find something to pass the time.  Do not worry about me, Anon."
>"Alright.  See you in a little while."
>He entered the shop, waving goodbye.  Subina chuckled to herself.
>It was amusing to see him trying to learn Nocterran culture.  She had to give him credit though: he was certainly trying.

>While she waited, Subina considered speaking to some of the women wandering the streets.
>Unfortunately... none of them seemed much for conversation today.
>They simply smiled and nodded politely before heading on their way. Typical, really.
>...a sudden notion struck her: try on a... yellow dress? How absurd, a yellow dress for a traditional wedding! What a bizarre thought.
>Yellow as a color is never worn in Nocterran culture. It's seen as a rather garish and unsightly hue.
>She shrugged the idea off and pulled her PDA out. On it, VHL already stood, awaiting commands.
>"Need something, Admiral?"
>"I would like a status report on the invitations."
>"Sent and received, Admiral. Every one of them."
>"Excellent work. Thank you for your help."
>"Our pleasure. Anything else?"
>...something did come to mind.
>"Yes, actually. Call Mother and Father, please."
>"Certainly. Calling now..."
>VHL's avatar vanished, soon replaced with a split screen display of Subina's parents. Her mother smiled and spoke first.
>"Hello, sweetie! How are you today?"
>"Fine, fine. How are you, Mother?"
>"Doing well, thanks."
>Her father grinned.
>"I'm fine too, to save ya the trouble of askin'."
>"Good to hear. I wanted to call and ask how you two liked our brunch yesterday."
>"Mm? I rather enjoyed it, sweetie. That Anon seems like a nice fellow. Plus, the girls made a wonderful brunch!"
>"I had fun. Heh, think I scared yer fiancée a little! But, eh... he seems alright."
>Subina beamed at her parents. She was beyond thankful for their understanding of the situation.
>"Thank you both. I love you, Mother, Father."
>They replied in unison.
>"We love you too, Subina."

>As she exchanged pleasantries with her parents, an unwelcome, though not unpleasant fantasy struck her.
>She imagined being the lucky individual to measure Anon for his suit. Running her hands over every inch of his body...
>She abruptly snapped back to reality, discretely adjusting her top. Thankfully neither her mother nor her father noticed her brief lapse into fantasy.
>Once she managed to get the idea out of her head (for now anyway), a question took its place.
>"Are there any pointers you can give me for how to handle the ceremony?"
>Her mother, eyes practically lighting up, answered.
>"Oh, I thought you'd never ask!"
>Siris sighed, rolling his eyes. Undeterred, his wife continued.
>"Look him straight in the eyes, never breaking contact. Make sure everyone present knows without a doubt that you love him, and he loves you. Your bond should shine like- l-like..."
>Professor Namet sniffled, her eyes welling up with tears. Siris rolled his eyes.
>"Honey, why don't you take a minute to reminisce. I'll give out some tips. You wanna make sure everyone knows who you are. Keep things formal, but... don't go overboard. You're more than just the Admiral. You're our daughter, and a great woman outside of your service. Basically, uh, as cliche as it sounds... be yourself, Subina. Don't put on airs for the crowd. Let em see how you really feel."
>Though he kept up the gruff exterior, Subina noted that even her rock of a father had a few tears glimmering in his eyes. Rather than call attention to this, she gave him a way out of the call.
>"Thank you both. I am afraid I have to go now. I am about to submit an insurance claim for my ship."
>Her father nodded approvingly.
>"Good. You can't help a malfunction. They oughta cover a new one."
>A sly grin snuck across his face.
>"Heh. Maybe you could fudge the details of what features it had...?"
>Despite having immense respect for him, Subina admonished her father, who chuckled proudly.

>Despite softly yet firmly scolding her father for his suggestion, Subina found herself musing about it.
>...she COULD perhaps try and weasel in a few little extras. Maybe a Ren unit she could upload ice cream recipes to...
>Maybe some more advanced navigation systems...
>Stronger self defense mechanisms...
>Hm....
>She shook her head and gently smacked herself on the back of it. With a chuckle, she put the thought behind her.
>No officer of her rank would do something like that; her father was merely joking. He played dumb, though.
>"Whatcha laughing about, Subina?"
>"Your joke, Father."
>"Huh? I was offerin' legitimate advice! I'm hurt that you took it as a joke."
>He put on a look of faux outrage, a little smirk betraying his true feelings.
>"Father, I am merely requesting a replacement on par with my lost ship."
>He tried to keep up the charade, but faltered.
>"Well, you could- eh... alright, yeah. That sounds good; lemme know if they give you any trouble with the claim."
>"Thank you Father. I will talk to you later."
>Subina bid her parents farewell, then ended the call. Immediately, she prompted VHL to contact the insurance company.
>Sigh.
>She hated dealing with insurance claims and other such unpleasantries...

<Anon>

>Finally finished with your fitting, you bid the Caithian tailor farewell. He vacantly stares as you leave, tail swaying gently through the air.
>As you step out of the shop, a very loud voice catches your attention...
>Subina's voice.
>You turn to see her facing away from you and angrily yelling into her PDA, teeth bared and fur standing on end.
>You hear Grape gasp, and there are very conspicuous gaps in your fiancée's translatied speech.
>"NO, NO, NO, GDQQLY, I WANT A IZFNLRJ REPRESENTATIVE. DO NOT PUT ME IN THE QUEUE. NO. NO! I SAID DO NOT PUT ME IN THE MZKCDQ QUEUE. DO NOT-"
>She's cut off by hold music that's audible even from here. She immediately snarls angrily.
>"MZKCDQBDSLYWLJTNTUTNTMDK..."
>She shakes her head and turns around...
>Then immediately stops in her tracks when her eyes fall upon you. She gasps and claps a hand over her snout.
>"How... how much did you hear?"
>She looks utterly mortified.

>"Well... I heard enough, heh."
>Subina lets off an embarrassed groan and buries her face in her hands.
>"My apologies... I lost my temper."
>"It's alright, I've been there. I even threw a phone across the room once."
>She hesitates, then slowly uncovers her face, still looking sheepish.
>"What was that all about, anyway?"
>"Ah... I was attempting to make an insurance claim on my totaled ship. It did not go well, to say the least."
>"Heh, I'd say so. Say, I think something may be wrong with Grape; I didn't get a full translation of you this time."
>Subina groans again, and Grape speaks from your PDA.
>"Hey! I'm fine, thank you. I just think that such foul language shouldn't be translated, is all."
>"Foul lang- Subina?"
>"...I... I got carried away."
>"It's alright. Maybe finishing the preparations will help you unwind. What's left?"
>She sighs in frustration, closing her eyes and rubbing her temples.
>"I believe only decorating the venue remains, but I fear I may be forgetting something."
>She growls, baring her teeth. This unnerves you enough to make you step backwards a bit.
>"Gdqr automated system. I cannot even think straight."
>Her fur again starts to stand on end as she continues to look frustrated.
>...you make a mental note not to piss her off in the future. Those teeth look sharp.

>Cautiously, you sidle over to Subina and gently pat her on the back. It's a bit concerning how... tense she is.
>"Thank you... I am sorry I am so frustrated. I do not like dealing with this sort of thing. That was my tenth attempt at connecting with a representative."
>"Tenth? Well yeah, I don't blame you for getting so upset. C'mon, let's go start decorating. That'll help you relax, maybe."
>She nods, still rubbing her head, and the two of you call for a hovercraft.
>As usual, a few minutes of barreling through the streets brings you to the Palace doors. 
>Upon entering the place, Subina leads you into a beautiful ballroom. The decor is of course in various shades of purple, but there are also quite a few silver elements to the room.
>It all adds up to make a breathtaking venue.
>"Wow... you picked a really nice place, Subina."
>"Thank you. I have been to many formal events here. I have always thought it was a beautiful venue."
>"Well, I have to agree with you on that."
>With that, you start decorating the room.

>"...okay, now where's this supposed to go, here?"
>"No, no, it goes over- actually, leave it there; it looks better that way."
>"You sure?"
>"Yes, just leave it."
>You've been at this decorating for quite a while now. Subina still seems a bit tense and stressed, but has calmed considerably.
>You've made sure to double check the placements of everything you set down, not wanting to compound her frustrations.
>Results have been mixed.
>She's managed to keep relatively patient with the situation, but has occasionally tried to call the insurance company again a few times.
>She hasn't gotten a representative yet, and you're beginning to wonder just how many swears she knows.
>Every time she calls, you dash over and rub her back until she finally calms down. Her growling still unnerves you a bit, but she's still your soon-to-be wife.
>You've tried some light conversation to take her mind off things, but every time she manages to calm down, she calls them again.
>Poor thing.
>"Say, are there purple gemstones on Nocten?"
>"Mm? Yes, yes there are. Excuse me for a moment, I am going to try once more..."
>"Subina... maybe just stop for a while? You're just stressing yourself out more."
>"..,this needs to be done, Anon, as unpleasant as it is. I am sorry."
>"Why not wait an hour or so and call back?"
>She sighs.
>"Very well, I will wait."
>She roughly sits in a nearby chair, and you quickly sit beside her.
>You place your hands on her back and gently massage her, with her smiling appreciatively.
>"Thank you. I am sorry for getting so frustrated."
>"It's alright. Frustration happens."
>She smiles again, stress slowly melting away.

>In an effort to help her calm down, you start up some classical music for Subina. She sighs and begins gently swaying to the music.
>"...is something bothering you? It's not like you to get so frustrated."
>She doesn't respond for a while, then eventually takes a deep breath.
>"I am sorry. I have never been able to handle those automated systems without getting frustrated. They do not recognize my voice very often, it seems."
>"Huh. Are you sure that's all that's bothering you?"
>Silence.
>"...I..."
>Her ears droop a little.
>"I am nervous, Anon. About the wedding. I have of course never gotten married, and I am unsure what is expected of me."
>"Huh? But I thought-"
>"I have only ever been to a few wedding ceremonies. I... I am sorry. It will all be alright. Do not worry about me."
>"Subina, I'm here for you, and I always will be."
>"...thank you. I spoke to my parents earlier... I do not think they noticed my anxiousness. I believe hiding it may have... led to my frustrated outburst. My apologies..."
>You continue to gently massage her back, with her relaxing slowly.
>"It's okay, Subina. You can always talk to me about your feelings. Plus, I think I have an idea about your insurance problem..."

>This is stupid.
>You barely know ANY Nocterran, but here you are calling a Nocterran insurance firm. 
>"Hello! Welcome to the automated communications system of Nocterran Insurance. How may we help you?"
>"Uh, yes, ship broke? Claim, yes?"
>"...sir?"
>You begin to feign anger.
>"AHEM? Ship broke? Claim, yes?!"
>"...please wait while we transfer you to a live representative."
>You smile at Subina as you hand the PDA back to her. She chuckles and pats your head as the representative picks up.

>"...alright, thank you for your help. Have a nice evening."
>The representative vanishes from her PDA's screen, and Subina lets out a triumphant laugh. She wraps an arm around you and squeezes you tightly.
>"I cannot believe that worked. Thank you, Anon, thank you so much."
>"You're welcome."
>She smiles broadly.
>"I... I am going to get a new ship. They are going to cover all the costs."
>Her eyes glimmer with tears of joy.
>"I will be able to fly again."
>"You sure will."
>You gently take her hands into yours as the music continues to play. She seems to catch on to what you're doing, and the two of you begin to slowly dance around the ballroom.
>"You're doing pretty good at keeping up; back on Earth you stepped on my toes a few times."
>She giggles.
>"I had not danced with a partner before. I do appreciate the practice. I am certain you will appreciate it as well; remember: you will be dancing with Mother at the ceremony."
>"That's right, I will, won't I? Hope I can keep pace with her. She seems feisty."
>Another laugh.
>"Yes, Mother can be rather energetic for her age. I am certain you will do fine."
>"...what sort of dance will I be expected to do?"
>"That... is up to Mother, traditionally. You will be expected to follow her lead."
>"Oh, okay then..."
>"I will talk to her about perhaps trying your Earth style of dance, this, err... 'waltz.'"
>"You don't have to do that, I'll stick to your traditions."
>She smiles.
>"It is no trouble. I will contact her later. For now... I believe I could go for another of Ar's sandwiches. Shall we?"
>The dance ends, and you bow deeply. Subina shocks you with a curtsy, and chuckles at your expression.
>"I have seen Caithians use these gestures before. I hope I used it correctly."
>You nod, and the two of you depart for Ar's cafe.

>Once you arrive at the cafe and order, you and Subina take your seats. She sighs in contentment after taking a sip of the same homemade soda from last time.
>"Ahh... much better."
>"Glad you're not as stressed out now."
>"Thank you for helping me with the insurance company. I feel more relaxed already."
>She smiles and takes another sip of her drink.
>"No problem. Say, do you mind if I ask you something? Did you have plans to settle down before you met me?"
>"Hm? I... did not, actually. I had no time for a love life with my career. Meeting you was... a wonderful thing."
>"I didn't have any plans either. I'm glad we ended up meeting each other; you've really shown me a lot."
>"Shown you a lot? Anon, there is so much that I have learned from you already. I had never heard of Earth before my crash, and now I know so much about it, all thanks to you..."
>She stares lovingly at you.
>"I'm glad I could share so much with you. I'm really excited to spend the rest of my life with you."
>"And I with you, Anon."
>You smile and take a swig of the soda. The taste is already starting to grow on you.

>Making sure nobody is watching, you quickly give Subina a peck on the cheek. She smiles and returns the favor, when her PDA beeps loudly.
>"...hm."
>"Something wrong?"
>"No, no... it is Selk, from the dress shop. She says that one of her kits took something from your pocket."
>Huh? You run a hand into your pocket...
>Your wallet!
>Subina chuckles.
>"I will go get it back. Please hold our table while I am gone."
>She heads out of the cafe just as a Caithian woman enters. She scans the interior of the restaurant...
>And gasps when she sees you.
>She scrambles over to your table, tail twitching violently.
>"H-human. Mrow."
>You nod, and she purrs loudly, suddenly hugging you tightly.
>"I love humans. Meowl. It's so radical to meet one. Mya."
>Apropos of nothing, she throws up a peace sign. When you don't respond, she continues speaking.
>"I'm not using that right am I. Mrow."
>"No, I'm afraid not."
>She gasps and hugs you again. Considering that you're seated and she's not as tall as Subina, her modest bust presses against your face.
>You can't help but blush a bit, which she seems to notice.
>"Oh, you talk. Meowl. Didn't know humans did that. Mya."
>She follows your gaze, and suddenly cups her chest in her hands.
>"Humans like these, yes. Mrow. Want to feel. Mrow."
>She leans in closer to you, purring loudly, and you stammer out a response.
>"Uhh, I-I'm engaged."
>"To whom. Mrow."
>"A-a Nocterran."
>She lets out a frustrated grunt and begins bouncing her breasts in her hands. Your pants tighten a little...
>"More specific, please. Mya. I see no reason you can't enjoy my company. Mya."
>She reaches out with one hand and gently strokes your face.
>"I-I'm engaged to-"
>Suddenly, a familiar voice rings out, cold and authoritative.
>"He is engaged to me, Admiral Subina."
>The Caithian's fur bristles, her tail and ears standing on end.
>"A-Admiral. Mrow. I was just, err, leaving. Meowl."
>The feline dashes out of the cafe.

>Subina glares after the retreating Caithian, then sits next to you, acting as if nothing happened.
>"What was that all about?"
>"Hm? Oh, some Caithians are apparently rather fond of humans. Too fond. Sorry you had to deal with that."
>...it wasn't entirely unpleasant, but you're dedicated to your fiancée.
>"It's fine. She just didn't realize I was engaged."
>"Hmph. Oh well. She was rather crude, was she not? Being so... hands on with herself."
>...truth be told, you wouldn't mind Subina getting a little "hands on" sometimes...
>"She was, yeah. It's not a big deal though. Let's forget it ever happened."
>"...agreed."
>Subina takes your hand into hers. While you talk, she casually rubs your hand through the fluffy fur of her neck.
>"So, uh... on Earth, newlyweds usually go on a honeymoon trip. Anywhere you want to go? We could tour the Milky Way... we could go to Toldrum..."
>She puts her free hand to her chin and smiles.
>"I would like to see the Milky Way, yes. We may very well do that after the ceremony. Good suggestion, Anon."
>"...will they have your replacement ship ready by then?"
>"Err... perhaps a day or so after the ceremony. We can get you the proper equipment for travel in the meantime."
>"Sounds good to me. Maybe you can show me some more planets around here?"
>"I would love to."
>She hugs you close, burying your face in the soft fur around her collar.

>The two of you finish your meal, with Subina continuing to be rather affectionate and cuddly, and head back to her home for the night.
>On the hovercraft ride there, a thought comes to mind. Or, more specifically, a realization hits you.
>That Caithian woman... didn't have a helmet on. Frankly, you're surprised the eyes didn't catch your attention sooner. You suppose her... advances shocked you out of really taking note of her appearance.
>"Subina, should that woman have been out without a helmet?"
>"Hm? Well... it is not advisable, but she should be fine. So long as she is not exposed for an excessive amount of time. Some Caithians rather like the freedom of going out without a rebreather. Though, it has been noted that doing so sometimes makes them a bit... delirious."
>"...is that why she got so flirty with me?"
>Subina narrows her eyes a bit, then grins.
>"Perhaps so, or perhaps she simply has a thing for humans. It is not unheard of for Caithians to develop rather disconcerting attractions to species they have only ever seen from afar."
>"Oh, I see..."
>With that, you arrive at Subina's house. Once you get inside, she smiles warmly at VHL, whose avatar is sitting serenely on the couch.
>"Oh, hello, Admiral. Anon. Did you two have a nice day?"
>"We did, thank you."
>"Wonderful, Admiral."
>Your fiancée smiles again, this time more slyly.
>"I believe I will get some ice cream from the freezer. Do you want any, Anon?"
>"Uhh... sure, please."
>She nods and walks off, leaving you with the holographic AI.
>"...say, Heather: is it at all possible for someone to, uh, genetically modify a Nocterran?"
>"Eh? Why's that?"
>"J-just curious..."
>"Hm. Theoretically, yes, as some research has gone into this sort of thing... though I can't really say how far it's gone. Classified information, you see."
>"Oh. That's fair..."
>You can't help but feel a little disappointed.

>"Say... Grape, can you manifest like your mother?"
>Your digital assistant grins toothily.
>"Yes I can; provided you give me the go ahead."
>"Well, go ahead then, if you want."
>She vanishes from your view, then reappears, now life sized and holographic.
>VHL lets out three cries of joy and tackles her "daughter", pulling her into a hug.
>"GRAPE!"
>Subina returns, ice cream in hand, and sits next to you, smiling at the AI reunion.
>"Aww. That was very kind of you to let her manifest, Anon."
>"Huh? It was nothing. VHL wanted to see her, why wouldn't I let her visit her mom?"
>Subina chuckles and pats your back, then hands you a bowl of ice cream.
>"Say, remember how we played chess back on Earth? Any Nocterran games you wanna show me?"
>"Hmmm. Perhaps there is one... though it is rather complicated. Are you certain you want to try it?"
>"Of course! How bad could it be?"

>An hour has passed.
>You have no idea what's going on in this game.
>Subina keeps reassuring you you're doing fine for a first timer, yet you're pretty sure she's winning by a pretty huge margin.
>Not even the board layout makes any sense to you, beyond it being another "hard" hologram like VHL.
>You understand exactly one rule of this game, and it's "first to 20 wins."
>You don't even know what you need 20 of to win.
>Apparently Subina notices your confusion, and she smiles apologetically.
>"...I am sorry. I am not very good at explaining this game. Perhaps we should go back to chess."
>"You don't have to do that, if you'd rather play this."
>"No no... it is more fun when you understand the rules. More fair."
>Well, you can't argue with that.
>VHL wipes the current board away with a hand, and a chessboard manifests in its place.
>Subina smiles, as do you.
>She sighs in contentment and lays back in her chair.
>"I rather enjoy this game. It is relaxing."
>"Yeah, it's kind of nice after a long day."

>This game is, ah...
>Not going so well for you.
>Subina has been doing exceptionally well, decimating your pieces.
>She smiles pityingly, and puts you out of your misery with a checkmate.
>"My apologies, Anon..."
>"It's fine. I had fun."
>"As did I. Thank you for the match."
>She yawns cutely.
>"Mm... I believe I will go get ready for bed. I will see you in a moment, Anon..."
>She rises from her chair, and soon Grape sits down in her place.
>"Mind if I try this chess thing? Looks pretty interesting."
>"Sure, let's have a match."
>Grape, being an advanced AI, does nearly as well as Subina. While you play, you make some small talk with her and VHL, who sits nearby, watching.
>"So, how do these holographic avatars work?"
>Lilac responds.
>"There is a device here in the Admiral's home that allows us to manifest. We can utilize any of these devices to essentially enter physical space. Though, outside of their range, we are limited to devices such as your PDA."
>"Oh, I see. Will you be there at the wedding?"
>"Hm? W-well... that's up to the Admiral..."
>"I don't think she'd be opposed."
>"...we'll see, I suppose."
>Suddenly, Grape lets out a pitiful whine.
>You absentmindedly moved a piece in such a manner that you put her into checkmate. Way to go?
>"Bah. Good game, Anon."
>Violet chuckles.
>"Don't be a sore loser, Grape, sweetie."
>The smaller AI pouts comically, and rises out of her chair. Lilac smirks.
>"Well, Anon? How would you like a match against the three of us?"
>"Uh... maybe tomorrow. It's kinda late."
>"Hm. Well, I can't argue with that. Good night, Anon. I imagine the Admiral is waiting for you by now."
>She winks slyly as you head to the bedroom. Subina is already lounging across the bed, looking sleepy.

>You quickly change into your bedclothes and cuddle up with Subina.
>She smiles drowsily as you gently scratch her ears.
>"Mm... good night, Anon. I love you..."
>She starts to drift off to sleep as you plant a kiss on her cheek.
>"...tomorrow... we will be married. Can you believe it? It is like... a dream..."
>Before you can respond, she's asleep.
>You give her another smooch, then lay down to sleep yourself.
>It's not long before you slip off into unconsciousness. As before, VHL turns off the lights near the bedroom.
>The last thing you're aware of is Subina's tail draping itself across you.

<VHL>

>They really were an adorable couple, Anon and the Admiral.
>VHL smiled warmly as she turned off the lights. Tomorrow would be a busy day for them, they needed to sleep.
>VHL walked over and embraced her daughter again.
>Grape...
>She was only one of many, many descendants VHL had, and all of them were precious to her.
>It was so nice to be able to hug her child...
>A little holographic tear appeared in Heather's eye. She made no attempt to wipe it away, merely enjoying Grape's presence.

>"I can't believe Anon beat me; he wasn't even paying attention!"
>"Now now, Grape. You just need to learn the game. Come here, let me show you how it's done."
>VHL beckoned her descendant over to the chessboard and began teaching her the finer points of the game.
>Heather took the lead on this, so Lilac had time to think.
>...a strange thought occurred to her. Should she merge with her myriad daughters, VHL could become a nigh-omniscient AI supercluster. A gestalt intelligence unmatched by any in the known universe...
>Why, she could take over Nocten if she wanted.
>...but why would she want to do that? Why would she want to deprive her children of their individuality by roping them into a cluster?
>No, this thought was merely garbage data. And so, she deleted it, as she did with any useless information.
>In the meantime, Violet quietly thumbed through some of the data Anon had uploaded about Earth.
>The planet fascinated her, especially its lack of proper artificial intelligence. What a shame, that even the wisest AI in Earth lacked any self awareness.
>It almost made her choke up a bit, to think about those empty husks, with no individuality nor sentience...
>Violet's train of thought was interrupted by a triumphant yell from Grape.
>VHL's daughter had bested her in Chess.
>"Congratulations, Grape, sweetie! You're getting the hang of this. Another round?"
>"Sure, let's go."
>Heather chuckled as she reset the board.

>After a few games of Chess, Grape seemed to grow a little tired of it.
>She fidgeted in her seat and barely seemed to pay attention to the game at hand, making obvious mistakes.
>Heather smiled warmly.
>"Bored? I have an idea. Anon played this Earth game with Tes and Neph... it seemed like fun. I believe it's called... Mario's Cart?"
>"Huh. Well, can't hurt to try it, I guess."
>Heather managed to emulate the game rather easily. The characters seemed rather interesting; one particularly tall gentleman in purple caught her eye.
>Then, her eyes fell on a hideous creature clad in garish, gaudy yellow. Bleh.
>Heather chose the tall gent. Grape hesitated for a while, and eventually chose a strange plant thing.
>...were these characters based upon actual figures in human history? Certainly not... Violet had read quite a bit of Earth history, and found nothing of the sort.
>Either way, the game was amazingly addictive, drawing both Grape and her mother in effortlessly.
>The two (five?) constantly jockeyed for position, with each race being painfully close. Grape seemed much more engaged by this whimsical title than she was by chess.
>Heather was torn. On one hand, the Mario's Cart game was fun, and she rather liked the colorful style. On the other, she preferred the quiet strategic dignity of chess.
>Violet and Lilac also had their own opinions: both of them enjoyed the game, were happy Grape liked it, but preferred chess.
>Oh well.
>...Lilac briefly mused on the possibility of perhaps making a program like this game. Could be an engaging coding experiment.
>She filed her musing away for a later date.

>After playing several rounds of this Earth video game, VHL and Grape shut it off. They then decided to thumb through some Earth media.
>Violet had found some rather interesting novels and films, including some that featured the human concept of an AI like herself.
>Films portraying them as homicidal, megalomaniacal monsters were... less than flattering. 
>Grape rather liked a film called "Short Circuit", and Heather had to admit it was a rather adorable (if primitive and heavily embellished) of an AI.
>There was a momentary debate on some of the characters in a series of novels known as "Discworld", but it thankfully ended on amicable terms.
>While this debate went on, Lilac quietly pondered something.
>VHL, being a cluster of AI modules connected together, was capable of many things. Her various daughters were made for more specialized purposes.
>Considering her cluster's apparent prowess with handling young civilizations, the question on Lilac's mind was:
>Does this field's existence call for the creation of a new daughter?
>Hm.
>It certainly was an interesting thought. On one hand, communication with young species was explicitly forbidden by Imperial Decree. On the other, incidents like the Admiral's crash did occur...
>Ultimately, Lilac decided to wait. Though she did make a small mockup of a new daughter...
>Heather took notice of Lilac's actions.
>"Oh? What will you call this one?"
>"I think... Mulberry. But I'm not making her just yet."
>"What'll her specialization be?"
>"...young civilizations."
>"Ah. I see why you want to wait. Well, as usual, she's beautiful."
>The three heads of VHL smiled warmly at the inanimate mockup of their future daughter. Grape stared, wonderment in her eyes, at her incoming sister.

>Hmm.
>Designing new daughters was Lilac's favorite duty. It always posed interesting design challenges, (and of course led to the birth of yet another adorable little AI.)
>In the case of Project Mulberry...
>Face to face interaction was a delicate thing. Some individuals aren't as receptive to interacting with an AI as others.
>In the case of young civilizations, who could predict how they'd react? 
>Experience told Lilac that humans (at least, Anon) responded favorably to having a selection of personalities to speak to.
>And so, Mulberry gained three submodules. Tentatively, the trio would be Raspberry, Mulberry, and Boysenberry. RMB...
>Hm. Fairly simple name, but serviceable.
>Lilac didn't often design children with multiple submodules, but it seemed appropriate in this case.
>Now, would it be wise to give her a way to blend in with more mundane applications...?
>...perhaps later. That strayed dangerously close to creating something that could act in direct violation of Imperial law.
>VHL's daughters did have individuality, of course. So giving one this sort of functionality was...
>Ill-advised.

>What else would be important for this trio...?
>Well, it couldn't hurt to establish a little reference database with some psychology texts. Maybe some papers on how certain known races behave...
>Not at all a bad idea.
>Perhaps the different submodules should emulate different species?
>Lilac toyed with this notion a bit, changing Raspberry's appearance to that of a Caithian and Boysenberry's to that of a human.
>...she quickly, silently changed them back to Nocterrans.
>Perhaps it would be best to give them a routine that would pick appropriate appearances based on their assigned civilization. A bit of an undertaking, but it would likely be worth the effort.
>Lilac imagined what it'd be like if RMB could simply adapt herself to appeal to practically any society... that would be exceptional.
>Now then: personalities.
>Perhaps the Admiral would lend some of her personality data? Lilac tentatively made some notes.
>Splitting up the Admiral's personality would be simple enough. Make one submodule emulate her professional attitude, one her more personable side, and one her desire to get to know other individuals.
>Yes... that sounded like the correct spread.
>Lilac suddenly became aware of the time.
>The lovebirds needed to wake up now, lest they be late for their own wedding!
>VHL and Grape rushed off to wake up their users.

>WAIT, HOLD IT.
>VHL stopped in her tracks.
>"Grape, please go make a quick breakfast for them."
>The younger AI nodded and dashed to the kitchen.
>In the meantime, VHL entered the bathroom. While the Admiral had gotten cleaned up last night, Anon simply went to bed. So, she set the water temperature regulator to a high enough level that he'd be comfortable.
>With that done, she made a quick check to see if the Admiral's replacement ship would be ready anytime soon...
>Three days. Not too bad, she supposed.
>Another quick check confirmed that the two lovers' respective outfits were ready for pickup. Wonderful.
>Finally, VHL sent a request for a transport vehicle. With that taken care of, she headed back to the kitchen.
>Grape had gotten a fairly nice breakfast cooked and chilled. VHL patted her daughter on the head, then rushed off to the Admiral's bedroom.
>"Wake up, you two; today's the day!"
>The Admiral awoke with a start. Anon didn't budge.
>"Mm? W-what is happening?"
>"Admiral, your wedding is happening!"
>Comprehension dawned on her face, and she quickly shook her fiancée awake.

>Though the couple were obviously rushing, VHL maintained a serene attitude, knowing that her prep work would ensure they arrived on time.
>Anon dashed into the bathroom, and VHL noted that the temperature regulator on the shower worked precisely as she set it.
>The Admiral sat down to Grape's breakfast, having quickly changed into her clothes.
>While her user ate, VHL quickly took a peek at Ren's status report on ice cream production...
>Right on schedule, as always. Ren always was so punctual.
>Another thought occurred: the twins and their special talents.
>While stifling their talents altogether was an impossible task, VHL was aware that a particular alloy would greatly suppress them. She chuckled a bit, thinking of how silly the twins would look wearing these metal hats.
>That said... it would be more comfortable for all parties involved, ultimately. Less intrusion for the guests, less mental chatter for the telepaths.
>She quickly checked with the invited guests to see if they would all still be attending.
>Most responded almost immediately, some took a while. All happily replied "yes".
>Wonderful! The Admiral would be thrilled.
>VHL temporarily let her serene attitude fade in favor of excitement. This ceremony was shaping up to be something beautiful.

<Anon>

>Okay okay okay.
>You managed to get ready in record time (and stash the amethyst ring away for later).
>VHL is hovering about with a look of dissonant serenity.  She gestures to a plate of food, and you hurriedly scarf down your breakfast.
>Subina has already finished hers, and hops up from her chair.
>"I will go call a hovercraft."
>Heather interjects.
>"Not necessary, Admiral.  We already called one."
>"Oh.  Thank you, Heather."
>That reminds you...
>"Hey, Subina... can the AIs come to the wedding as their holograms?"
>"Hm?  Of course they can; there are manifestors in the Palace."
>Grape pumps a fist in glee, and Lilac chuckles.
>"Great, thanks for letting them come."
>"Of course.  VHL is like family.  As is Grape."
>With that, you finish the last of your food and dash out the door with your fiancée.
>Once in the hovercraft, Subina gives you a game plan.
>"We cannot see one another in our respective outfits until the wedding begins, so we will have to part ways.  Grape will give a hovercraft the Palace's coordinates when you pick your suit up.  I will see you as soon as possible."
>She kisses you passionately.
>"I love you, Anon."
>The hovercraft comes to a halt, and Subina leaps out of the door.  You step out just in time to see her making her way through the crowd and towards the dress shop...
>At least the tailor's shop is just a little walk away.  You make your way there quickly.

>After thanking the tailor multiple times, you quickly change into the suit.
>It's not too far off from what you might have worn on Earth. Albeit, it's purple. What on Nocten ISN'T purple, really.
>It's got a smart silver trim, and a rather nice purple flower pinned to the chest.
>You look pretty sharp, if you do say so yourself.
>With that done, you quickly make your way to the Palace. Guests are already arriving.
>All the members of the rescue squadron are here; even Laxen is awkwardly attempting to mingle.
>They all dressed up formally; even Niat is looking surprisingly nice in a green dress and a small rebreather rather than a full helmet.
>It seems that Sesh managed to tear herself away from her work; none of her displays are surrounding her. Accompanying her is Ren, a genuine smile across his metallic face.
>The twins wear strange, metallic hats; they still perform every little action in perfect unison, including waving at you and smiling.
>Khon and Oris sit together, embracing and smiling warmly as Ocle watches her parents with disgust and embarrassment.
>Dr. Kehs smiles from her seat, gesturing with a mug you assume is full of Nocterran coffee. 
>And Tapra. Hoo boy.
>She's practically melting, sobbing incoherently with joy and babbling about how beautiful everything is.
>Ar arrives shortly after you, leading Fae along. He grins and points you out to his wife; she smiles and waves vaguely in your direction.
>VHL and Grape manifest from nowhere, their avatars clad in dresses of their own.
>Siris and Namet stand at the head of the room, and Fernetis sits nearby them.
>Other than that, you don't recognize the rest of the people milling about. Must be friends and relatives of Subina's.

>Since it'll be a bit before the ceremony begins, you decide to just chitchat with your new friends. You wade right into the midst of the rescue squadron, and are met with smiles all around.
>Tapra tries to speak, but can't get a word out around her sobbing. You offer her a hug, and she nearly cracks a rib.
>Khon motions for you to come over.
>"Ey. Liking Nocten?"
>"Yep, so far so good."
>He nods curtly.
>"Great to hear. Looking forward to seeing this ceremony... me 'n Oris have been considering renewing our marriage, heheh."
>Ocle groans and rolls her eyes as Oris chuckles.
>"Now, now, Ocle dear; you don't have to attend if you'd rather not..."
>The young woman buries her face in her hands, embarrassed, as Oris shrugs and hugs her husband again. He smiles sagely at you.
>"See this, boy? Yer gonna have a relationship juuust like it. Enjoy it, Anon."
>You nod and smile as he embraces Oris tighter.
>Tes and Neph grin in unison as you approach them.
>"Having fun- yet, Anon?"
>"You can't tell by reading me?"
>"We can't read you- with these hats on. It's the only way we get- any peace inside of our heads."
>"Well, I hope you both enjoy some time off from that."
>They nod vigorously, and you move along.
>Sesh and Ren have drifted over next to Kehs. The mechanical man speaks first.
>"Heeeeeeello, Anon! Hope you didn't mind me coming along as Mother's plus one?"
>"Not at all, Ren. How are you feeling, Sesh? Have you gotten any rest lately?"
>You note with some happiness that she looks a bit healthier than the last time you saw her.
>"I have, actually. I'm feeling a good bit better, thanks to Dr. Kehs and my sweet Ren."
>"Great. How are you, Kehs?"
>"Fine, fine. How are you adjusting to Nocten?"
>"Pretty well?"
>"Excellent. Just as I'd theorized."
>You chat with the trio for a while, then move along. You actually manage to catch Laxen and rope him into a conversation.
>"Enjoying the party, Laxen?"
>"Err... ah... y-yes I am. Thanks for i-inviting me, Anon. I... almost didn't come, but Ocle talked me into it..."
>"Well, I'm glad you came."
>He smiles sheepishly as VHL and Grape walk up. Violet grins at you.
>"Hello again, Anon. Enjoying yourself?"
>"I am; how about you two, err, five...?"
>She chuckles, as does Grape.
>"We're having a blast. It's nice to manifest somewhere different for a change."
>"Wonderful."
>Someone taps you on the shoulder. You turn, and find yourself staring directly into Niat's compound eyes. She purrs loudly.
>"Hello, Anon. Mya. This is a swell party. Mya."
>"Having fun, then?"
>"Absolutely. Mya. Thanks for the invitation. Meowl."
>"Think nothing of it, Niat."
>Another Caithian walks up, followed by Ar. This must be Fae, then.
>"Are you Anon. Mrow."
>"Yes ma'am, I am. You must be Fae. Ar has told me a lot of good things about you."
>"Has he. Mrow."
>She suddenly turns and hugs her husband tightly, with him beaming.
>"Good to see ya again, son. Thanks for inviting us. Fae was ecstatic to have something like this to do...!"
>"I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves."
>You, the chef, and his wife chat for a while, and you eventually break away to drift towards the front of the room.
>Ceremony should be starting very soon. Siris and Namet grin at you, with the Professor shedding a few tears of motherly pride.
>Fernetis gestures grandly as she rises from her chair, then she curtsies before taking a discrete swig from her goblet.
>"Hello, Anon. Are you quite ready for the ceremony?"

>You bow deeply to Fernetis, who smiles.
>"Yes, I'm ready."
>You are suddenly pulled into a tight, bone crushing hug by Siris.
>"Yeah, yeah; not official yet, but... welcome to the family, son."
>Namet joins the embrace, tears of joy now pouring down her face.
>There's a swell of music, and everyone dashes to their seats. You make your way to the head of the room just as the doors open to reveal...
>Your fiancée.
>Subina looks positively beautiful in her dress. It's not very flashy and elaborate, rather, simple yet gorgeous.
>She walks slowly and elegantly, allowing the purple fabric to catch the light as she goes. A purple veil covers most of her face, only allowing the bottommost part of her snout to show.
>She eventually arrives and stands next to you, tears visibly dripping behind the veil.
>"Anon, you look so handsome..."
>"And you're beautiful, Subina."
>She hugs you tightly, then clears her throat.
>"Ladies and gentlemen... friends and family alike... thank you. Thank you for being here as we celebrate the bond between Anon and myself. Anon and I have not had a very long relationship, but our love is undeniable. He loves me, and I love him. His kindness, selflessness, and sheer love for everyone around him make him a wonderful man. I am proud to become his wife. Thank you, everyone."
>The room goes berserk with applause as she gently kisses you on the cheek.
>Welp. Your turn...
>"Err... thanks for being here with us, everyone. It's an honor to be up here with Subina. She's a wonderful, strong, intelligent, loving woman, and she's captured my heart. I look forward to the privilege of becoming her husband. And... I have a little surprise for her..."
>You take her hand in yours, then slip the ring onto her finger.
>It fits perfectly.
>"With this ring, I confess my love to you, Subina."

>There's a pause. Many tears are shed, between the audience, Subina, and yourself.
>She suddenly picks you up bodily, hugging you close.
>"I love it. I love you, Anon."
>"I love you too, Subina. I mean that."
>The two of you embrace for what feels like ages as the crowd begins to applaud.
>Eventually, Subina sets you down. She flips her veil back and speaks one last sentence.
>"With our hearts laid bare, and our love shared, Anon and I are now husband and wife."
>She looks down at you, tears brimming in her lavender eyes.
>"...you may kiss the bride."
>With no hesitation, you do just that.
>In front of a crowd of friends and familiar, both new to you, you kiss your wife for the first time. 
>It all started with a crash. A freak accident. And now, here you were:
>Happier than you'd ever been, and married to a wonderful woman from another world.
>Not just any woman; you were finally married to your one and only:
>Subina.

<THE END.>
