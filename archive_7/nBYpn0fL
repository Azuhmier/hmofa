>It’s been a long time since you went out after work, in fact you can't even really recall the last time you did
>But your co-workers convinced you to come to this sleazy club with them
>Loud electronic music blares and people dance around, fueled by far too much alcohol
>The smell of beer and various foods fill the air as you clench your own drink
>Sipping at it calmly, you feel the warming sensation the alcohol gives you as you look out onto the dancefloor
>Humans and Anthros all dance, some to the beat of the music, some not so much
>You see a few of your co-workers dancing with a few Anthros girls, looking to score
>Maybe they would get lucky and then brag about it to you later
>As you stare outwards towards the crowd you barely notice a figure slide closer to you out of the corner of your eye
>You fully notice it when its bumps into you violently, causing you to spill your drink both onto your shirt and onto the floor
>"Ooooh Soorrry" says a feminine voice as you attempt to wipe some of the alcohol off
>"It’s fine, just be-" 
>You stop mid-sentence as you look at the offender
>A Horse Anthro, and a gorgeous one at that
>Long, flowing light blonde hair that falls freely around her shoulders and a matching color tail that is neatly braided 
>Her fur is cream colored, with white bits around her very visible cleavage and on her calves above her hooves
>Several fur dye tattoos cover the visible parts of her sleek voluptuous body, the most Notable of them being a red circle around her left eye
>She has on denim short shorts, and a pink Tank top with the word "PINK!" on it in white letters, with no shoes at all because of the hooves
>"Hiii humieeeboy! I’m sorry! Lemme get you another drink!" she says with a few slurred words
>You're at a loss for words until she grabs your wrist and drags you to the bar, where she waves frantically at the barkeep to get his attention
>"I ssspilled his drink! His next one is on me" she yells over the music
>Satisfied with herself, she smiles at you
>"Heyyyy, you're pretty cute for a human, I’ve never been with a human before" she says, looking you up and down thoughtfully
>She pushes close to you
>"What’s your Name Mr. Human?" she asks; you smell a bit of barley wine on her breath as she speaks
>"My name's Anon, nice to meet you" you say a little awkwardly
>Never before had a woman just outright done this to you, usually it was you awkwardly trying to ask for a date and inevitably dropping the spaghetti everywhere 
>"Oooo Anon, huh? I like it! My Name's Sun! What drink do you want?!" she says, pressing her body against yours
>Maybe you could try to be smooth?
>"Uh how about whatever you're having Sun? We can share it" you say, feeling her large breasts press against you
>She gives a large Smile then waves down the bartender, still pressed against you, and partially leaning on you
>"Mr. Bar man! Get my friend a killer Penguin!"
>A what?
>The barkeeper hands grabs a bottle, pops the top off, then hands you a bottle of dark amber liquid, which is in fact an Barley wine ale
>"Those ones are sooooo Good! Here lemme show you!" Sun says, taking the bottle from you
>She drinks of the ale, then pulls you into a Deep kiss, forcing the liquid into your mouth
>Her tongue also finds its way in and you savor the sweetness of the ale 
>You push back against her tongue with your tongue as her hand rubs up and down your back
>She pulls away with a grin
>"Ohh I LIKE you Anon! Let’s go!" she says, grabbing your hand and pulling you away, leaving the beer bottle forgotten 
>"Barkeep put it on my Tab" she calls out cheerfully as she pulls happily
>You see a few of your co-workers as she leads you out of the club, looking both shocked and jealous
>They had joked earlier that they would score and you wouldn't; but it looks like the joke is on them
>Sun leads you out of the club and into the crisp night air, where a row of taxis are waiting for any drunk partygoer
>"You place or mine?" she asks, flicking her tail against you playfully
>"Uh...how abou-"
>"My place it is!" she says, practically skipping to the nearest Taxi
>You follow her and open the door for her because why not?
>"Such a gentleman, I knew I liked you" she says as she slides in and pats the spot next to her
>You get in and shut the door behind you
>"106 Dogwood Street Please!" Sun calls out
>The driver, an Anthro canine of some sort, simply nods and starts the meter
>As soon as the Taxi starts moving Sun, is pressed against you once more, her large breasts engulfing your upper arm as she runs one of her fingers down your chest
>"You're alllllllll mine tonight" she whispers into your ear as she gently stops her hand at you crotch and massages softly
>It’s amazing how quickly your body reacts, almost instantly your member is rock hard
>"Someone is happy to see me!” She moans to you, rubbing your shaft through your pants
>Why let her have all the fun?
>Even though your arm is nestled between her breasts you can move your hand to rub the sensitive spot between her legs, earning a quiet moan into your ear from you
>"Just like that Anon" she moans, rubbing you a bit harder now
>As you press your fingers against her pants, a thought forms in your head
>You literally just met this girl, were you really about to do this with her?
>A sudden kiss from her shuts that thought down quick; as she continues stroking you through your pants
>Yes, you were going to do this and you were going to make it count!
>You feel the inside of her mouth with your tongue and rub her harder, noting how a wet spot is growing
>She moans into your mouth "Soooo good" which spurs you further
>You’re about to just say 'fuck it' and reach into her shorts when the Taxi lurches to a stop
>"20 bucks" the driver says gruffly, as you open the door and get out, Sun close behind you
>You dig into your pockets (which was quite hard to do with the erection you were currently sporting) and pull out two 20 dollar bills 
>"Keep the change" you say hurriedly, not wanting to waste time with change and tips and other BS
>Sun has he breasts pressed against your back as you hand him the bills, and you wanted nothing more than to the those clothes off of her
>"Cheers" he says simply before driving off
>Sun immediately grabs your hand and pulls you into a small town house
>She opens the door quickly and pulls you inside, then shuts the door behind you
>Instantly, she’s on you with a deep kiss, with her fingers running up your chest under your shirt
"Ooo so Smooth Anon, I can’t wait to see the rest of you~" she says as she pulls away from the kiss
>"But not here! We have to be quiet; my roommate and her boyfriend are here!"
>She grabs your hand once more and leads you up a flight of stairs, her tail gently flicking you, keeping your eyes locked onto the round ass in front of you
>She pulls you into a bedroom and flicks on the light
>The first thing you notice is movie posters covering the walls, the second thing you notice is her tank top hit you in the face
>You pull it away and see Sun already working on her pants button
>Her left nipple has more of the red fur dye, an arrow pointing up and anther pointing down
>"Don't just stare! Get out of those clothes!" she calls as she slides her shorts off, which are slightly wet
>You need no other invitation and hurriedly peel your shirt off and undo you pants, and slide them off
>"Wait, I wanna do this next part" Sun says excitedly, as she strides over to you, swaying her hips seductively and making her large breasts bounce with each step
>She drops to her knees in front of you, sliding her hands down your chest and abs
>"Mhmmm I like" she says to herself before coming to a rest in front your badly hidden erection
>The fabric from your boxers strain to keep it contained
>"I've always wondered what a Human would feel like"
>With that her fingers slip under your waist band and slide your boxers off
>Your erection springs forwards, ready and eager to get going
>Sun stares at it for a moment in awe
>"It's....big Anon"
>Her fingers delicately wrap around your member, and gently pump along your length
>"It’s different from the others species...No knots or spikes just...You" 
>She looks up at you and rubs your shaft a bit more
>"Can I taste it?"
>What kind of question was that?!
>"Uh yea, go ahead Sun" you say, placing your hands on your hips awkwardly
>She smiles and focuses once more on your erection, then licks the head gently
>"I like it" she says before taking your shaft into her mouth
>You weren’t small by any means, but the shape of her long face meant she could easily take your entire length 
>She sucks it gently a few times, then you feel her tongue rub up and down 
>With one hand gripping the base of your erection, she moves her head and hand back and forth, making sure to pull back just far enough for the tip of her tongue to rub the sensitive head of you cock
>"Mhmmm you like that?" she says as she opens her mouth and pants a bit
>you notice as you look down at her, a wet spot has been forming on the floor beneath her
>Sun looks down, then back up at you and smiles
>"Time for the main event, you must be about ready to burst~" she says standing up and leading you to her bed, with is covered in a mess of blankets and pillows
>She pulls you into a kiss, then turns you around and pushes you backwards onto the bed
>Like a flash she’s on top of you, pinning your erection between her wet lips
>"Looks like this horsie gets to ride someone tonight" she says with a smile, grinding back and forth on you, spreading her wetness on your shaft and lower abdomen
>You place your hands on her wide hips as she grinds you and moans heavily, her ears fluttering wildly and her tail whipping side to side
>"Let’s see how well you fit" she says in a singsong tone, sliding back so she can grip your base and position pussy over your erection
>Not waiting for anything else, she drops herself roughly onto you with a soft wet squelch
>Almost immediately, she moans loudly and her tongue flicks out of her mouth a little, her eyes closed in ecstasy 
>"Alllllll the right places" She moans breathlessly, her hands falling onto your chest
>The feel you are getting must match hers
>A warm, wet tightness that clenches with every one of her panting breaths
>Far tighter than any human you’ve been with 
>Sun's eyes open and focus on you
>Ggooooood Anon, you’re perfect" she moans, her hands rubbing your chest
>As she said a little bit ago time for the main event
>You thrust upwards into her wetness earning an ecstatic moan
>"Ohh There you go!" she moans, bracing herself on your chest and beginning to move on her own
>Expertly, she raises and drops her hips deftly, all while rotating them so your cock grinds every inch of her insides
>As she goes, her panting gets wilder and wilder as her squeezing wetness gets tighter
>"Ah Ah-ah-non I’m c-cloooo-" she doesn’t even finish her sentence and her pussy clamps down hard with violent shudder of pleasure, she tries to close her knees together, but is blocked by your body
>Her insides shudder and shiver as she rides out her orgasm, giving you waves of pleasure, but leaving you wanting more
>When at last she relaxes, she looks down at you with a satisfied smile
>"H-how did you stay stiff after cumming in me? Every other guy goes limp after" she says leaning forwards onto you
>Your cock is still buried inside her as she speaks, throbbing in pent up sexual energy
>"I didn't cum Sun" you say with a hurt smile
>She expected you to not last this long?
>She sits up quickly and looks at you in surprise
>"Y-you didn't? You mean you can keep goi-"
>You buck your hips upwards, forcing yourself deeper into her to answer her question
>She lets out a surprised moan and falls forwards onto you
>Time for you to take control
>You wrap your arms around her and roll both of you over
>Missionary is always fun
>"You want to see what humans can do?" you say calmly, rubbing a hand down her long face
>You grab her thighs and move them so her legs are over your shoulders
>She gives a meek nod, biting her lower lip softly
>"Then. Let. Me. Show. You." you say, thrusting deep into her with each word
>Beastly moans come from her with each thrust as you continue plowing into her tight pussy
>Those tits of hers had been pressed against you since you met her, and they need some love too right?
>Right
>You grab each one with fervor, and savor the soft give of them and her fur beneath your fingers
>Squeezing and kneading then gently as you continue thrusting hard into her you hear her murmur "P-pull my nipples"
>Who are you to say no?
>You pinch her nipples between your thumbs and the knuckle of your forefingers, twisting them gently and pulling
>Sun's eyes roll up slightly as you feel her second orgasm hit; squeezing you tighter than before
"O-o-o-oh MY.GOD." She moans as you plow her roughly
>You don’t even bother stopping as you pull her towards you by her nipples, earning less off a moan and more whimpers of pleasure
>but now your limit was approaching
>As Much as you wanted to keep going, her tightness and squeezing send you ever closer
>"S-Sun I’m close!"
>Her legs shift from over your shoulders to around your waist
>You could have stopped them with your arms that were pulling and pinching her nipples but you just instinctually moved them out of the way and grab her succulent breasts once more
>"D-do it! Fill m-me up with you Human seed" She moans, locking her legs around you, her hooves clicking together like an odd lock
>You don’t even protest it as you give one last deep primal thrust into her, spurting all that pent up sexual energy into her
>Sun caresses you as her womb gently squeezes you, attempting to milk you for all you can give, which you give eagerly
>"H-holy fuck Anon, Humans are amazing" she says happily, rubbing your chest with her hands and keeping you deep inside her with her strong legs, which are still locked behind your back
>Her eyes gaze at your body and the look up to you longingly
>"Uh...would you ever consider having more...fun with me later?" he says with a coy smile
>You nod and wipe the sweat from your brow
>Holy fuck, that was amazing
>You feel her legs unwrap from around you, so you gently pull out of her quivering pussy
>Droplets of your seed spill out of her wetness as you lay down next to her
>Sun turns and wraps her arms around you as she gazes at you
>"Uhmm, to tell you the truth Anon, I was never really drunk, but I wanted to know what a human was like" she says with a coy smile >"And when I said every other guy... i meant guy, one guy..."
>You thought she seemed a bit too sober after that initial run in, but who fuckin' cares?
>You nod at her and rub the side of her face, savoring the warm fur under your fingers
>She gives a happy smile and closes her eyes, pulling you close to her in a state of bliss
>You grab one of the blankets strewn across the bed and cover you both, then wrap your arms around her
>Sleep comes easy, and you savor the feeling of having someone in your arms at the end of the day

>When you awake, Sun is gone but you smell coffee, and a few other pleasant aromas wafting through
>You pull on your clothes from yesterday and wander downstairs
>Sun is in her kitchen making some sort of food
>"Hi Anon! Sleep well?" she says, wearing nothing but an apron
>You smile and nod, then pull her into a hug and kiss
>"I hope you weren't lying about wanting to see me again" you say as you break from the kiss
>She gives a happy smile and pulls you closer
>"You are the best man I’ve ever been with, who took the time to make me...climax, I defiantly want to see you more" she says with a happy smile
>Well now how could you argue with that?
>You think back to your coworkers, struggling at the club to get laid
>Guess from now on, Sun would be the one threatening you with a good time
