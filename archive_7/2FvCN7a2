[jackal, robot, very short]

>All you can hear is the voice of the collective
>Shouting out in hungry cacophony
>Creatures of all sizes and color sit around you, waiting to satiate their hunger
>Dozens of staff members frantically run around
>Wading through the poorly maintained resort restaurant
>Shoving the highly-valued customers aside
>A few (very obviously drunken) aliens you don’t recognize the species of seem to be playing a card game off in the corner
>Very loudly
>A child is watching an educational cartoon at max volume while being ignored by their parents
>A mother and her sons are at the center of it all
>Screaming at a fox waiter over the son’s incorrect order
>You’ve almost made it out of the room and you can still hear her screaming loud and clear over all the other voices
>Poor Cherry, she only started this year
>You finally make it to the desired staff exit
>Fumbling with your keycard for a moment, you finally have access to the other room
>As the door automatically closes, the sounds end abruptly
>The air became stagnant
>The cacophony of voices turns into a euphonic silence
>All you hear is your own breathing and your drum of your heartbeat 
>Thanks to the top-of-the-line soundproof technology here
>The dull grey walls of the ship is plastered with old, gaudy posters and advertisements
>The staff liked to hang posters from years past as a sort of memoir of the season
>You stand up, letting out a sigh of relief
>You don’t work at the restaurant, but you just gained a new respect for the people who do
>You intended on simply passing through the cafeteria to get to the other side
>But it was so much worse than you had imagined
>You begin walking down the labyrinth of grey hallways
>A turn to the left...
>Two turns to the right...
>And down the hall...
>And now you’re on the other side of the ship, where you intended to go
>In hindsight, it probably would’ve been easier to just go around and not attempt to go through the hellhole that is that cafeteria
>Seriously, that place is way too cramped
>The door opens to a mild cacophony of voices
>Not nearly as bad as the restaurant was of course
>More like a hotel lobby
>Large windows show off the vast and empty space
>Contrasted against colorful kiosks selling various ethnic trinkets on the other side
>The walls are a grey metal color and flooring is imitating wooden designs
>This is one of the most common forms of space architecture
>If you didn’t know where you were, you’d assume you were in a mall
>While you were standing and soaking in the same view you’ve seen since coming here months ago, the sound of an opening door rings in your left ear 
>You look over and see Elora step into view
>A jackal anthro that looks completely normal on the outside
>But in reality, she’s actually an android
>Designed and built specifically for this ship
>Unlike most other androids, she was built with a personality and some resemblance of sentience and self-awareness
>Usually androids like her are specifically reserved for government-related work
>How the resort company managed to get their hands on her is unknown
>Your best assumption is that they bought her under the counter for several billion dollars
>It’s the only logical conclusion you can think of
>Because a robot like her doesn’t come around often
>Especially in a fucking resort ship of all places
>”Ah, hello Anon.” she said in her half-upbeat half-monotone tone of voice
>She walked up to you and gave you a warm smile
>Her synthetic tanned-colored fur looks so pristine
>It covers the intricate mechanical organs hidden just under the soft artificial skin
>Masquerading her robotic features to give her more life
>She’s dressed in the same staff uniform you wear: a red tee with the resort symbol on it and jeans with a lanyard around her neck signifying she’s staff
>The only difference being her bare feet
>Being an anthro, or a synthetic anthro, she has no need for shoes
>Must be a cultural thing
>You dunno, you never figured it out
>You quit gawking for a moment and remember that she said something to you
>You realize she’s been standing still, staring at you and waiting for an answer
>”Uhh yeah, hey Elora.” You say in the most unintentionally awkward way possible
>Not like it matters to an android though
>”Are you also on your way to the event as well?”
>”Yeah, I tried to take a detour through the cafeteria area but it’s a lot wilder than I imagined. Like, fuck.” You responded
>She nods
>”Indeed. This time it the worst time to cut through, hundreds of standard guests tend to choose this time to eat.”
>Despite the fact that you’ve been working at this resort for three years, you haven’t actually known that
>All you heard from the other employees was that the cafeteria area was a perpetual hellhole
>But you never imagined it was THAT bad
>Prior, you have only been there when it was empty
>Elora’s ears perked up suddenly
>”It is currently seven o’clock SST, we need to get going.”
>You nod and start to walk along with her
>The distant voices of the few resort-goers were further distanced by the steps of your shoes and the noticeably louder clacking of Elora’s synthetic toe-claws
>Each gift shop passes by as unremarkably as they are colorful
>”So, Anon, how has your day been?”
>”Ehh..it’s been mostly boring. It was the same old shit until I decided it was a good idea to cut through the cafeteria, which probably took more time than just going around it.”
>”Indeed. People are truly wild animals in that place.”
>She said that as sympathetically as possible, but she always has that passive emotionless tone to her voice
>”Yea. So how’ve you been doing?”
>”Hmm...it has been nice. It was my turn to work the Alcohol Bar again.”
>You’ve worked the Alcohol Bar before
>It’s a bar at the pool area that tends to get surrounded by dumb teenagers trying to get alcohol and drunkards
>It’s honestly one of the worst places to work
>It’s so bad that the resort staff rotates who works there so nobody has to deal with it for too long
>It’s so bad nobody that bothers learning the actual name of it
>Just calling it the Alcohol Bar
>Unlike most here, however, Elora actually doesn’t mind working there
>It’s probably because she’s coded to tolerate it, but still 
>She’s the only one
>”Why don’t you just work there permanently? It’s saves us the stress of doing it.” 
>”Because I work other jobs here as well. You know that, we have been casually conversing for the past five months.”
>She’s right
>In hindsight, you’ve probably asked her that at least a dozen times since you two have started speaking
>”Oh, right. Forgot.”
>”It is alright, I get that question from the other staff members often as well. Although you have asked the most of all.”
>”I know” You say passively 
>The memories of you asking her that exact question floods your mind and hits you like a boulder
>A few moments of silence are broken when Elora speaks again
>”So this event is once again for the same high-profile politicians that we have been hosting the past two months.”
>”Well, yea, the captain said that they’re gonna be here to us back before we left.”
>”I was just reminding you. After all, you seem to have a faulty memory for a human.”
>”Shut up.”
>You both laugh at the dumb quips and settle into silence for a few more moments
>A familiar staff door comes into view surrounded by resort staff idling around in formal clothing
>”Ah, we are here.” Elora commented as you two approach the door to a staff-only changing room
>You scan your keycard and hear a generic beep to signify the door unlocking
>You both enter the generic dull grey room
>The same type of room present in all staff-only back rooms
>There were already a few other staff members of various species changing or have already changed
>Elora gets her keycard and the two of you scan them onto a panel
>Beeps sounding to signify the keycards have been successfully read
>In that moment, two sets of formal clothes drop onto a faux-wooden platform in the room
>Clothes which are the perfect sizes for the two of you
>Or at least, the clothes sizes written on your keycards
>There were only a handful of changing rooms
>You two managed to find an empty room, which you both entered
>The architecture is basic and all you can hear are the voices of the other staff and your own footsteps
>Elora immediately begins changing into her formal clothing
>Much to your surprise
>The prior times you’ve changed, you had the blessing of snatching a changing room for yourself
>You embarrassingly uttered an soft yelp out of surprise over her lack of clothes
>Elora seems to have noticed, and she lets out a small laugh
>Your face begin to burn up over both the yelp you just produced and seeing Elora partially nude
>As artificial as she is, she still has all the private parts a real jackal anthro has
>Elora keeps quiet and you hear her continue to change
>Well, if Elora isn’t uncomfortable with you seeing her change, then you shouldn’t be uncomfortable with her seeing you change
>You begin by taking off your shit and quickly replacing it with the dress shirt
>You felt awkward changing in front of her like this, but then you remembered that she just a robot
>And thus wouldn’t judge you, right?
>After both of you were successfully changed, you both exit the changing room and wait by the exit
>Where the other staff were waiting and idly conversing with each other
>Soft words from the figuratively faceless staff go through your ear and right out the other
>So since everyone is likely going to be here for a while, might as well make conversation
>”So, Elora, you ready for another VIP event full of snobby rich people and corrupted politicians?” 
>She snickered lightly
>”As ready as my programming lets me.”
