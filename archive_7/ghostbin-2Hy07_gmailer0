(you) are a detective, one of those that money can get you around these parts of town, and life isn't so bad.
Today is a slow day, not many bastards doing bad things or ladies that want their jewels back, and It's that time of the year where the days are starting to shorten, so sometimes the sun's rays aren't enough to warm you, so now the radiator's on. You're eating olives while talking.
-I swear, the climate couldn't get crazier these days.- you say, taking out an olive bone from your mouth.
-Tell me about it, I saw three different forecasts today and none talked about afternoon's rain.- said your secretary, getting into your office.
-And who invited you in?
-The radiator, cheapskate; had to do business with a mantle on my legs like some old lady-She took a seat in front of you, taking an olive and gorging on it with her beak.
You did get a secretary bird as a secretary, thinking they must be good at it if they were named like that. Your opinion now was that it was as good as most secretaries, but at least you're both comfortable around each other, something to be appreciated.
-So, do I have anyone to trail after?- you said, expecting some adventure.
-Nope, today is as busy as a rest day, that's why I'm hanging out with you.
-makes sense.
 There grew an expected silence, a calm one where you're just glad to be into whatever you're in, that whatever being newspaper article about the horoscope, which gave you a topic.
-Hey Ann, when was your birthday?
-Oh It's tomorrow. why, have you got me a gift?- she smirked at the thought
-It's not for that you goose, I just wanted to know your horoscope.
-You know I'm not one of those fucking honke-
-Oh so you're a Sagittarius?-you interjected her slur- It says something funny about you.
-Oh really? what does it say- she said while grasping at the olive bowl for them, only to find a disappointing void- Hey, there's no more olives, get more
-I wasn't expecting to share them. Anyways, it says that "your love doubts will be answered, as a conclusion is being seen as a surprise to you".
-Wow... that's a load of crap.- she said dismissively- I'm sure that was written as vague as possible for the type of people that believe this. what love doubts would I have? I'm single, with little things to look for apart from this job and origami.
-Origami?
-Yeah, those little folded-up paper animals and stuff. I know a guy who got these japanese magazines full of instructions to do them.
-Sounds good, you should bring one to work.
With that messy situation averted, you gaze at the clock on the wall to see the time, almost time to close now.
-Hey, we've got to pack up, day's over- you said, taking your jacket from your chair and putting it on.
-Oh come on, I was about to talk back with some witty remark.
-Well, you'll have tomorrow to say it- you took a little box within your hands.- and Ann?
-What?
-Happy birthday.
