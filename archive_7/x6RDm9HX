01. Leopard Bartender

>The swirling brown in my glass always got me. It could be anything and I'd still drink it. It calms me, I tell myself. Keeps me from being irrational. A nice glass of scotch stops the emotions from flowing, stemming them at the source and bottling them where they belong.

>'Be a man they said. Keep those tears in 'til the day you die then keep them in even longer.'

>The Amusing Jungle was always sparse this time of night. Two people sat at tables and a single person at the bar. Me. An unassuming, 20-something man named Anon. The bartender made a sweep around the place, getting people drinks and trying to remain cherry. How she managed to glide around the place that fast I'd never know.

>It took a minute before I looked back at the glass in front of me. Alcohol was my one vice, my one escape from the daunting day-to-day of the factory... but after warming me, I'd always feel the emotions flooding back.

>'Pull yourself up by your bootstraps Anon, stop acting like a little...'

>My thoughts escaped me when my eyes fell back on the glass in front of me. A swift motion and the glass emptied, leaving a bright red tint on my face that grew brighter with every passing second.

>"Sue, another glass please."

>The leopard woman seemed to read my mind, having another glass ready midway through the sentence.

>"Long day I take it?"

>I sighed, pulling my hands from the counter and taking a quick swig from the new glass in front of me.

>"Last day more like."

>She raised an eyebrow and leaned into the bar.

>"Somethin' happen?"

>"Yeah. Those fuckers replaced my position with a machine. Last time I trust a "morale officer" that tells me I ain't losin' my job ta' a machine before losin' it ta' one."

>She sighed and put her hand on my shoulder.

>"Ah. Fuckers, the lotta 'em. Nobody cares 'bout handmade things no more. It's all about automation and gettin' things out faster. Ain't nobody got time to sit down and wait anymore, or so they say."

>Sue always knew what to say. I guess when you're a bartender for fifteen years you just learn how to talk to everyone.

>"Besides, ya' still young. You got ya' whole life ahead 'a ya'. Get out there, meet a gal. Maybe then you wouldn't be drinking your cares away in this shithole."

>It was always funny when Sue talked bad about her bar. She'd often berate the place, even picking up loose floorboards and tossing them about to make a point. Regardless of the disrepair, it's a wonder how this place stayed open for over a decade.

>"Trust me Sue when I say it's better ta' be drinking in here then tryin' ta' try my luck with the ladies. It's like I broke a mirror while crossin' a black cat's path under a ladder. Good luck findin' a girl who'd take me over the first bastard she sees walkin' around."

>The clock above the bar was just about to hit 12:00 AM, closing time.

>"Eh, just stick around long enough and you'll find one."

>*DING* *DONG*

>The chimes from the clock struck against each other, signalling time for the bar to close.

>"Alright ya' louses, getcha' butts outta here. I'll see ya' all tomorrow."

>Seeing it was finally time to head home, I started to turn before Sue caught me by my wrist and stopped me.

>"Or if ya' stick around here, one'll find ya'. That is, if you're fine with an older woman... and an anthro to boot."

>"Why?"

>"Because I choose ya' over any random bastard on the street."

>My frown flipped, a bright smile overtaking the dreadful attitude I had been in.

>"Pour me another drink and I'll stick around as long as you want."

>The glass filled with that same scotch I'd come to love. She handed it to me before clasping her hands over mine.

>"How's forever sound?"

>"Just fine ta' me."
