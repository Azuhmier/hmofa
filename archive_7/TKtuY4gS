>You wake up in a stark white room. The smell of cleaning products permeates the air, giving you a bit of a headache.
>Or is that from the bruise you can feel on the back of your head?
>You blink a few times, then scan your surroundings. You seem to be in some sort of... lab? All manner of equipment is spread neatly around the room.
>You are lying back, strapped into an observation chair not unlike one from a dentist's office.
>As you try to figure out what's going on, you tentatively call out for help.
>Immediately, a door opens.
>In steps a pair of... sheep women?
>Indeed, their wool and hooves seem to confirm that much. The two look completely identical, clad in glasses and labcoats.
>They both stand at about your height, and have respectably large busts and wide hips.
>One of them nods curtly and clears her throat.
>"Good morning, Specimen 4N-0N. I trust you are well?"
>"W-where am I? Who are you?"
>She smiles patronizingly, then roughly pats you atop the head.
>"That information is none of your concern. But, if you must have a name... call me Dolly."
>The other woman nods in agreement, then speaks in an identical voice.
>"Likewise."
>The first woman speaks again.
>"You are here for research purposes. It is my job to examine you carefully and thoroughly. I trust you will comply with my tests, yes?"
>You grimace a little, and she frowns.
>"4N-0N, I cannot proceed without your consent. It would behoove you to agree. The faster I finish my examination, the sooner you can return home."
>At this revelation, you nod vigorously.
>"Okay, okay. Do what you need to do."
>"Wonderful. Let's begin."
 
>It's at this point that you realize something.
>You're stark naked. Thanks to your restraints, you are entirely incapable of covering yourself. Not that that keeps you from trying.
>Dolly frowns.
>"Would you be more comfortable if I released your arms? I cannot completely free you just yet, however."
>Without awaiting an answer, she presses a button on the wall, and your arms are unbound instantly. You wordlessly hide your shame. She chuckles.
>"4N-0N, this is a scientific examination. I can assure you that I have seen indecent males before."
>She strides over to you, hooves clicking against the floor. Without so much as a word of warning, she grasps your length. You can't help but let out a gasp at the feel of her warm, fuzzy hand.
>"Mm. Interesting. You seem to be more reactive than anticipated. Applying further stimulation..."
>She deftly pumps her hand up and down your member, quickly bringing you to attention. The other woman, apparently ALSO named Dolly, takes notes down on a clipboard. The first Dolly continues to stroke you, a look of mild fascination across her face.
>However, despite her airy detachment, a lascivious glint in her eye soon becomes apparent.
>As you approach your limits, you buck your hips unconsciously. The sheep raises an eyebrow.
>"Already...? I suppose I'll collect a sample, then."
>To your shock, she instantly drops to her knees. She wordlessly takes the length of you into her mouth just as you fire off a load.
>Effortlessly, she swallows the whole thing, backing off of you and clearing her throat with a faint smile.
>"Mm. Seems to be in order. That's one test done, 4N-0N. Once I finish writing down my findings, we shall continue."
>Huh? But... she's not the one writing.
 
>After the other sheep finishes writing, they share a nod. The second Dolly sets her clipboard down and makes her way over to you.
>"Thank you for your patience. It can be difficult to manage writing and examinations simultaneously."
>You can't help but be confused. Another chuckle escapes the sheep's mouth.
>"Ah. Allow me to elaborate. The two bodies you see before you? Both mine. I find it makes my work much more efficient. It also allows for more..."
>Both the Dollies suddenly throw off their labcoats, revealing nothing but their bare bodies beneath.
>"...rigorous examinations. Shall we begin?"
>One of the two sheep kneels down and begins gently rubbing your member again, making fascinated sounds as it twitches and slowly returns to full mast.
>The other makes her way up to your face. With a wry smile, she buries your face in her woolly cleavage.
>The sheer warmth is undeniably pleasant, not to mention the softness of her wool. She playfully wiggles her chest back and forth, giving you a bizarre cranial massage of sorts.
>"Mm, how interesting. 4N-0N, please demonstrate what you would do in this situation normally. Pretend I am your mate, not an examiner."
>...why not?
>You begin motorboating. A shocked gasp escapes the lower Dolly, and the higher one moans appreciatively.
>"Mmmn... I see. Fascinating~"
>She steps back slightly, and you see her plunge a hand southward. She then returns to burying your face in her tits.
>She pants and moans rhythmically, and her other body continues to gently stroke you.
>Before long, it seems that both you and the sheep you're motor boating reach a climax. She lets out a cry of pleasure, and her other body again gulps down every drop of your seed.
 
>The examiner pants for a while, then speaks as if nothing happened.
>"I believe that test was an arousing success. Now then. One final exam, and you are free to go, 4N-0N."
>The Dolly that was previously content to merely stroke you turns around.
>Before you know it, she unhesitatingly plunges herself onto your rod, letting out a squeal, then a long sigh. The unskewered sheep smiles.
>"Wonderful. When you are ready, 4N-0N, please begin."
>"Begin what?"
>She leans in close with a seductive smile.
>"I think you know the answer to that."
>Indeed you do.
>Grabbing onto the sheep's arms, you begin rhythmically pounding into her. She lets off all manner of squeaks, bleats, and moans.
>Meanwhile, her other body remains almost comically serious, jotting down notes about your technique and her own reactions.
>You soon begin to reach yet another finish. You start to pull out, but the free Dolly stops you.
>"No, no. We wouldn't want to waste a perfectly good sample~"
>You carry on, eventually firing off inside the examiner. She pulls herself off of you, and collapses onto the ground, panting in ecstasy.
>Even the standing sheep has trouble catching her breath.
>"Wonderful work, me. 4N-0N? You were an excellent specimen. Thank you for your time. I regret to say we will have to keep you for one more day, however. Company policy, you see."
>You shrug. If this is how they do things here, you're certainly not gonna complain about another day.
 
>The two (one?) researchers bid you farewell once they recover, then leave you alone.
>As she exits, Dolly releases the restraints around your legs. You stand from the chair and stretch.
>You notice that one of the two bodies left behind a sheet of paper.
>You read over it, but can't understand much of the jargon.
>Oh well.
>After walking around a bit, you start to feel drowsy. You lay back in the chair again, and doze off...
 
>You are awoken by the door being flung open. Dolly (both of them) rushes in excitedly.
>"Eureka! 4N-0N, I have astounding news."
>Curiosity gets the better of you.
>"What is it?"
>The other body wordlessly holds up something. You squint at it, and your jaw drops.
>"Congratulations, 4N-0N. You have contributed to a scientific breakthrough. You're being promoted to lab staff, effective immediately. Because of this, you'll be expected to remain here until further notice. Thank you so much."
>Somehow, someway...
>She's pregnant.
