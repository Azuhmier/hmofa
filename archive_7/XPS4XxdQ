>It’s been over three weeks since Halloween
>25 days, specifically
>But who’s counting?
>Almost a month ago you were whisked away from a dull Halloween night for one filled with literal monsters, including the love of your life
>Volfa
>You never have to set an alarm to wake up in the morning these days, because as soon as you’re conscious you’re checking the phone for any word from her
>Nobody would believe you met an anthropomorphic wolf female dressed up like a grandmother that night
>Hell, some of them wouldn't believe you met a female at all
>Now, jaded thoughts intrude your mind, starting to make YOU believe it was never real to begin with
>It takes increasingly more energy just to leave home and face the world
>But then a crinkled letter shows up in the mail
>You hold the envelope like it was your life
>It might as well be, seeing as how life would be meaningless if you can’t share it with Volfa
>Before you get your hopes up TOO much, you check the return address
>You half expect it to just be some kind of insurance bullshit, a bill, or a straight up scam
>When you do a quick internet search your heart leaps up
>It’s the address of the Freak Fair grounds
>You gingerly peel open the envelope, careful not to tear it accidentally
>There’s a ticket inside, stiff in hardness yet warped as though it had been soaked in water (or something else) before
>It’s covered in runes and hole punches, but “one week round trip” is legible
>Also included is a single note, written on a contrastingly immaculate piece of stationary
>[LAST OF THE MONTH. BUS TERMINUS ORANGE. 11:59 PM. DO NOT BE LATE.]

>Your life is put on hold leading up to the big night
>Some of the people closest to you are a little concerned, and you probably burned a few bridges with work
>You don’t know whether you should tell anyone you have a girlfriend just yet, especially if you’re just up and leaving so suddenly to be with her
>Several days’ worth of clothes and other provisions have been packed and waiting since you got the letter
>You even call a cab well over an hour before you need to be there
>It’s a cold autumn night to be sitting by yourself at a bus stop
>Just you and your fall jacket
>Crimson red, hooded
>Ten minutes until midnight you get some company
>You were expecting a bus, or a limo, or even a hearse
>What you get instead is just a plain old sedan
>It’s not even made to be creepy or anything
>An elderly man with sagging jowls parks the vehicle in front of you
>He says nothing, not even acknowledging you as he stares off into the distance
>You check your phone every minute, hoping you don’t miss something
>11:59 PM
>”Ticket, please,” he moans
>You thrust the ticket at him, which he gives another hole punch and returns to you
>You dive into the car; the possible danger of the situation doesn’t cross your mind at all
>It’s too grimy to see out the windows as the ride veers multiple times
>”It’s sweltering in here,” the driver says
>He grabs the loose flabs of skin on his face and pulls the whole thing off, leaving only muscle stretched over bone
>You feel like you should be shocked or terrified, but Halloween really desensitized you to a lot of crazy shit
>The car soon falls into a smoother, turn-free cruise
>Hours pass by
>And you can’t fend off sleep forever….

>You wake up still in the car
>Dawn manages to pierce through the obscured windows
>”We’re just about there,” says the driver, picking at his exposed tissue
>You feel relief at not being murdered (or worse) in your sleep
>Then you feel excitement as you see a gothic station come into view
>This is just like in the movies!
>You’re fidgeting in the seat as the driver finds a spot to drop you off
>The sight of monsters and other supernatural creatures milling about inside almost doesn’t faze you in the slightest
>You seem to be getting more attention than you’re paying to any of them
>But you’re on a mission, and there will be time to gawk later
>Still, you make sure to scan everything you can just for a glimpse of…
>There she is
>Tattered jeans and a busy t-shirt of a metal band
>A long-sleeved version of a familiar vest, complete with the same plush collar
>A lavish jeweled choker that gleams to draw your sight to her
>Arm held against an archway, leaning with one leg over the other, and positively beaming at you
>Volfa
>She’s trying to play cool as much as possible, but as you run towards her she abandons any amount of composure she had
>There’s no forgetting the strength of the wolfess as she lifts you up for a hug
>You did it
>You made it work
>”It’s so good to see you again, Little Red,” she says, holding back tears
>Her raspy, subdued voice is the greatest you’ve ever heard
>She gives your jacket a feel after setting you down
>”I like it. Not as cute as that Halloween cloak of yours, but at least you got one with a nice hood!”
>Now that you’re safely reunited with the dark wolfess you’re able to take in the sights and sounds
>There are the mummies and vampires you’d normally expect, along with some pretty eldritch and indescribable abominations
>And whether through coincidence or a good sense of humor, most of the shops and restaurant stalls in the station are just like human equivalents with cheesy, spooky-themed names
>Once again, monsters stare right back at you
>”Haha, I guess you really don’t see any of this as strange until you got a human buddy with you,” she says
>A paw clasps your shoulder and the wolfess leans over
>”I’m still the best wingman you’ll ever have, so just stick close to me, alright?”
>You exchange wide smiles
>Hers falters for a moment, and that’s enough to put unease in your heart
>Volfa immediately brings her cheery, toothy demeanor back out
>”Hey, nothing’s wrong. Well, at least nothing we’re not gonna fix right now.”
>You continue walking through the station, through some lesser-traveled parts
>”I’m not sure if anyone has broken the bad news to you before, but…I’m afraid you’re a human, Little Red.”
>You give her a look of mock surprise
>”Yeah, I know, it’s heartbreaking. Inoperable too, unfortunately.”
>You glance at the directional signs as you pass them, one in particular you seem to be following
>Licensing and Customs
>”Yeah, we’re going to need to check you in before going anywhere. Not like we don’t have humans here, but those are usually your sorcery types with magic in the blood. Anyone we bring over from ‘your’ world needs to come here first.”
>The hallway leading to the customs office is barren compared to the rest of the station
>Obviously not needed extremely often
>”Getting approval is next to impossible by yourself. That’s why I’m gonna be your sponsor, Little Red.”
>Her muzzle hovers close to your face, and you plant a kiss against her black lips
>She pulls you firmly into her torso
>”Woah, down boy, easy! I’m just as pent up as you are, but it’ll make the payoff so much better if you can reel it in just a little longer, alright?.” 
>You nod in understanding
>She waited patiently for you, and you can do the same for her

>The customs office is bigger than you’d expect for such little traffic
>Of course, you soon see that’s entirely for the sake of the head supervisor
>Your head doesn’t even reach the top of his desk, and cigar fumes smokescreen the ceiling completely
>Only the middle head is smoking
>The right one is absorbed in a phone conversation
>The left one is busy with paperwork
>A massive cerberus, straining a dapper business suit
>The middle head takes one last draw of his cigar before setting it aside, smoke venting from his nostrils
>”Back again so soon, Volfa?” he says
>His casual voice is enough to reverberate through your body
>”Nah, just got lost on the way to the little girls’ room,” the wolfess says
>”So I see,” the middle head responds
>He looks at you with disdain
>”I assume this is the one you’ve flippantly ignored getting pre-approval to bring to our world?”
>”Yup,” Volfa says. “This is Anon, and it turns out he doesn’t NEED your bullshit pre-approval.”
>The desk is higher than even Volfa’s pointed ears, but she pulls herself up to the ledge and hangs there with her head in her paws
>”So then,” the cerberus continues, “does that mean he is magically awakened? Or a registered human ambassador? Or a provable deity reincarnation?”
>”Nope,” Volfa says. “He’s my lifekin.”
>The left head snaps his pen like a twig, spraying blood-red ink everywhere
>”I’m going to have to call you back,” the right head growls before slamming his phone down
>All three parts to the colossal hound are fixated on you
>”He’s your…lifekin?”
>”Yeah, funny story. Turns out after Halloween was over I realized I was DYING without having him close by. Got checked out by an apothecary and everything.”
>”So I see,” the cerberus seethes. “Regardless, he still needs the appropriate paperwork to be considered your lifekin. I’ve already made a GENEROUS exception giving him the ticket here, which, might I remind you, is valid only for ONE WEEK.”
>”You got a lot more excuses than exceptions,” the wolfess barks back. “You better not have forgotten the bet we made, either.”
>Volfa unfolds a stack of papers from her jacket and slams them on the desk
>”Anyway, here you go. All in writing from the doc herself. And if you want to confront her about it, be my guest. I hear she’s still a bit sour about needing to get a ‘practitioner’s license’.”
>The cerberus doesn’t even look at the papers before shoving them aside into a built up pile
>”Be that as it may, he will still have to go back to where he came from after his week is over.”
>Volfa’s face is full of spite
>”You wouldn’t KILL a poor girl like that, would you?” she says
>The flame in the cerberus’ six eyes tells you Volfa may have crossed the line with that remark, but the context of their feud is lost to you
>The middle head straightens his tie
>”Then I highly recommend you start filling out his paperwork for a return visit, and likewise for yourself if you ever want to visit him outside of our sanctioned yearly events.”
>He grabs out the largest, sharpest fountain pen you’ve ever seen
>Much more like a dagger than a writing utensil
>”I hope we’ve come to an understanding. Now then, on to the records. What is his name, again?”
>”Why don’t you fucking ask him yourself, old man?”

>The two of you leave the office without any forms, receipts, permits, or passports
>And yet, you have subtle feeling of belonging to this world now
>”Yeah, we don’t do that crap here,” Volfa says. “Not all monsters have clothes, let alone pockets. Where are they going to keep an ID card?”
>You ask her what a “lifekin” is supposed to be
>”‘Lifekin’ is just what it sounds like: people bonded for life. It’s usually for master/servant magical pacts, or some kind of, ah, symbiotic relationship? Body stuff, you know.”
>And now you’re her lifekin?
>She’s quiet for a moment
>”Might as well be. After we said our goodbyes, I got really, really sick.”
>You open your mouth to say something, thinking back to your Halloween dalliance
>”Ha, not like THAT!” 
>She punches you on the arm 
>“Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing a bunch of little Little Reds all over the place. Not yet, anyway. But I wasn’t sure what was going on. I thought maybe my depression drinking caught up with me, or I had some nasty bug from the Halloween crowds.”
>She leans over and gives you a sloppy lick from neck to ear
>”And now you have it, too.”
>You don’t want to touch the saliva
>A little because you’re afraid she’s right
>And a little because you want to keep any reminder of her
>”Ha! C’mon, you think just because we’re back together I’m gonna stop messing with you?”
>At this point, you wouldn’t care if you shared an illness with Volfa
>”Anyway, it was stupid to deny what it REALLY was. I was pretty smitten with you, Little Red. Heh, who would have thought THAT would be the thing to do me in?”
>Her head rests on yours
>”Buuut just to be sure, I got a second opinion from a sweet little apothecary, and she was more than happy to get her diagnosis in writing. Didn’t think it’d be so easy to get a doctor’s excuse for puppy love.”
>The outside of the station is on a hill (probably for aerodynamic monsters) overlooking an endless stretch of patchwork terrain
>Fields of gnarled crops, gaseous purple swamps, forests that shake with something huge moving inside them…
>It’s everything you’d imagine a land of monsters would live in
>Except maybe the scattered towns with some pretty high, modern towers
>”What, you think we all just live in huts or caves or something?”
>She points to a small glade nestled in the middle of all the intersecting domains
>”That’s where we’re going. Gonna have to explore every little space we can while you’re here.”
>Volfa gives you a wink
>”And after that, maybe I’ll even show you around town, too!”
>Boy is she pent up

>Gulchgut is a rather tight-knit town that looks like the residents are putting off removing their Halloween decorations for as long as possible, even after a month later
>”It’s a pretty big deal here,” Volfa says, “in case you didn’t notice.”
>You see even more unique and unimaginable creatures here than you did at the station
>And still, it’s you who gets the most stares
>But the faces (or at least what looks like a face) of the townsfolk brighten up when they see Volfa happily escorting you
>”Volfa! Is this the lucky one you’ve been talking about so much?” says a cauliflower-like spore, her children affixed to her back
>”Sure is!” the wolfess says proudly. “Can’t stop to introduce him to everyone yet. Gotta freshen up first. He’s really dirty.”
>”Oh? Well I’m no stranger to dirt, and he doesn’t look that…a-ah, I see!”
>The spore mother puffs up sheepishly
>Volfa leads you to a weathered apartment building with a sunken in roof
>Orange lights are stringed around it like chains, there are little bat stickers on the windows, and piles of decomposing pumpkins flank the main doors
>Volfa takes you by the hand, racing you inside
>Just like old times
>The inside has no consistent design or pattern to its layout
>Hallways twist and turn with dozens of doors all shapes and sizes
>Some corridors have simple carpet
>Some are filled with plants or bones
>Some have entrances you’d have to jump (or fly) to reach
>But once on the right floor, it’s impossible to miss her place
>Mostly because the door has “Volfa” carved deeply into it
>”Not like you’re going to reuse a monster’s room when they’re done with it,” she laughs. “You’re never getting your safety deposit back, that’s for damn sure.”
>Inside is exactly what you pictured the wolfess’ den to be
>Wall-to-wall posters of monster bands like the one on her shirt
>Bottles decorating the shelf space that all the clutter on the floor should be using instead
>A nest of bed sheets and clothes strewn about
>The only thing neatly organized you see is a familiar nightgown and bonnet resting on a table
>”It’s not like I was wearing it or anything!” she says, pitching the costume out of sight
>She then removes your jacket and folds it onto the now vacant space
>Her own jacket comes off and is placed on top, with her spiked bracelet like a crown on top
>”Much better. Gotta keep this clean and safe when you’re not wearing it. Everyone needs to know you’re MY Little Red when we’re out and about.”
>When you get a better look at the wall decoration you see probably the only formal picture in the room
>The three faces of whom you didn’t expect to see again so soon are fighting over the affection they’re giving to a lone, dark-haired female human
>She’s wearing a jeweled choker, and has subtle but familiar features that have been engraved into your thoughts since that fateful Halloween night 
>”Yeah, that’s her,” Volfa says grimly. “Uncanny resemblance, right? No need to tell the whole story, because I’m sure you’ve heard this kind of thing countless times already.”
>”Beast man meets woman, the two fall in love, some miracle brings a bastard child into the world, woman dies in childbirth. None of the medical practice in the monster world knew what to do with a human.”
>Volfa plays around with the choker on her neck
>”Frankly, I’m surprised the old man didn’t split her in half on the honeymoon. He got pretty despondent, though. Guess I was the lucky one for not being too attached to her.” 
>She walks over to the picture and flips it around
>”But they don’t need to see this “
>She claws at the hem of her shirt
>”You’re here for a week, so let’s start making the most of it. That’s seven times longer than we had the last time!”
>She wriggles her hips side to side as her top is yanked off, letting her humble breasts flop out unrestrained
>”Fourteen times, now that I think about it. We only hung out for like half a day, and what is that, like at least SIXTY half days since we last saw each other?
>She turns around and bends over to kick off her pants
>With a flick of her tail you see Volfa’s swollen lips, an arousal over a month in waiting
>”But who’s counting?”
>One second she’s teasing you from across the room, the next she’s at your pants before you can pull your own shirt all the way over your head
>She hasn’t lost one bit of her skill at drawing your manhood to an almost painful hardness as she inhales it into her muzzle
>And it doesn’t take long before she’s already bringing you close to your limit
>But unlike last time, she heeds your warnings and lets go with a slick pop
>”That won’t work,” she says.
>”Like I told you, I’m just as backed up as you. If we’re going to finally be together, shouldn’t we get it all OUT together?”
>She makes a good argument, but damn if you’re not at the breaking point
>Volfa crawls onto the disheveled bed and presents herself to you
>”But I’ll let you take the wheel first, since I had to be the one to break your heart last time.”
>She shakes her rump as you kneel onto the bed behind her
>You part her tender lips and dig in with your fingers
>Your tongue finds a deep passage, ending with a flick against her button
>Her tail reflexively bats you on the head
>”S-stop! Anon! “I’ve been THIS close for ages now! Don’t you d-dare get me off first, unders-stand? Just put the damn thing in already!”
>You try to get a few more seconds out of her, but that’s a huge mistake
>Her toned leg hooks around your neck and flips you onto your back
>Volfa’s now on top with her rear planted on your face, stifling you with her wet heat
>She squeezes your erection and raps a claw against your raw head
>”Oh, you don’t want to see me be the BAD wolf, Little Red. Keep testing me and I’ll take my bracelet and use it as a cock ring, with the spikes turned INWARD. Now, are you ready to do this right?”
>You try to give her a muffled response, which only tickles her delicate bits worse
>”AH, g-good then.”
>She lifts herself off your head, only to twist around and sink down onto your shaft
>You’re locked with her golden eyes
>”I can’t stay angry at you, Little Red.”
>With a strained “ruff”, she begins rocking
>The heat of her insides and the reddening marks from her claws on your chest make you feel like you’re burning up
>You’re sweating, and she’s trying to soak up as much as she can with her paws
>She’s fighting against her orgasm more than trying to build up to it
>”I…hah, you might…uggh…”
>Her thoughts are fragmented by her urges
>”N-no, not…yet.”
>Her efforts to stave the climax for just a moment longer recoil back at her
>Her face freezes, and a throaty whine escapes as her orgasm wracks her to the core
>It would have been a slow deflation of pleasure, if it weren’t for your release hitting her the very next second
>You’ve all but fried her mind as her climax rebounds
>Any semblance of restraint was thrown out with the most uninhibited groans and gasps you’ve ever heard from her
 “God…dammit, Little Red. I don’t want to have to sleep in because you wore me out so much already.”

*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*		*	

>It’s the shortest, most action-filled week of your life
>Volfa has something planned for every day
>And every night
>Your first full day is spent in Gulchgut, getting to know all the locals
>You meet an endless number of monsters. Friends and neighbors and a few strangers
>You try to remember as many as you can, but half of their names are unpronounceable anyway
>Thanks to Volfa, you’re accepted as one of their own within minutes
>Nothing goes unshared with these creatures, from greetings to stories to more trinkets that you know what to do with
>The food they provide isn’t too bad either, once you close your eyes and try to ignore where it might have come from
>When night stops by, the wolfess brings you to the tallest structure in the town: the bell tower
>”Alright, pants off,” she commands
>What, right here?
>”It’s not like most of them haven’t heard our little tryst last night. If we’re out in the open like this, they’ll still know to give us some space.”
>It doesn’t do much to ease your doubts, but once she’s at your groin again there’s no stopping her, or your erection
>When she howls her climax, it reverberates above you in the massive bell
>The second day is at the murky, bubbling wastes of the swamps
>It’s incredibly viscous, but despite the fetid look it’s safe enough for the two of you to wade in
>”Watch out if something tries to pull you under,” she says. “It’s probably me….”
>She doesn’t “splash” you so much as hurls a glob of sludge at you
>You both have to take a shower to wash out all the gunk, but it’s the perfect opportunity for a little “deep cleaning” in the shower later on
>The third day is at the biggest museum of dungeon designs, famous monsters, and torture devices in history
>”Just let me know if there’s anything you want to try out,” the wolfess whispers in your ear as you pass by the bondage displays
>You end up leaving the gift shop with a few extra belts for her arm’s vast collection
>A few for you as well
>Not for daytime use
>And she tightens them every time you make a dog joke (or she baits you into saying one)
>The forth day is at the Gulch Brawl, a free-for-all of monsters constantly pouring into the ring for a bit of “unwinding” and king-of-the-hill-style feats of strength
>The smart ones run away as soon as Volfa jumps in
>The dumb ones at least try not to land on their faces when she throws them off the hill
>You head home with yet another belt, though this one’s entirely for the wolfess
>”It’s nice, but not something I’d wear,” she shrugs, trying to fit it over her arm rather than her waist 
>“But those knuckleheads didn’t get all my aggression out. I think you know what that means, Little Red….”
>Your pelvis already starts to ache
>Each day has a life’s worth of memories, but it’s not without trepidation
>Every morning you wake up alone, fear rushing back as you remember the first time you were in an empty, foreign bed without her
>Volfa appears not long after, reassuring you with your first kiss of the day
>But each time she returns she’s increasingly haggard looking
>When you ask her about it, you never get a good answer
>”Don’t worry about it, Little Red,” she says. “Just a little bit of business. As much as I’d love it, we can’t be connected at the hip ALL the time, right?”
>Isn’t that what lifekin are supposed to be, though?
>You don’t tell her that
>On the night of the fifth day Volfa leaves you alone a second time, and is visibly stressed when she comes back
>”Just getting things ready,” she pants
>For what?
>”Just wait. You’re gonna love this!”

>When night falls, she leads you to an old mausoleum on the edge of town
>You can hear the bass of music coming from underground before you even enter
>She opens the door at the bottom of the stairs with a flourish and you’re struck with nostalgia
>”Just like Halloween, yeah?”
>It’s not exactly like the catacombs, but it’s pretty damn close
>In fact, a lot of it seems like it’s made to be as much of an imitation as possible
>The decorations, the music, the guests…
>Is this what she was always running off to do in the morning?
>”Hmm? Oh, yeah, you got me! Just had to get everything ready for our repeat performance! Everyone’s been helping me make the place just right!”
>Well it’s certainly an impressive effort, but something’s not right
>That’s when you notice Volfa’s barren neck
>Was it like that before she left you the second time today?
>”O-oh, my choker?” She winces at the word
>”Must have misplaced it somewhere, I’m sure it’ll turn up eventually, heh….”
>Her voice tells a different story, like a mother saying she “misplaced” her only child
>But she doesn’t dwell on it for very long, and you’re soon dragged through the various rooms of the party
>A little harder than you remember
>”Do you remember what order we did things in? I’m sure we’ll remember if…oh, drinks first! Trying to think what we all had…. Ah, screw it. We’ll just have to try every combination we can think of!””
>True to her word, the festivities start off with some pretty heavy drinking
>What was once nausea from thinking you drank the piss of a hellhound is now just regular old binge drinking nausea
>Even Volfa seems to have hit the bottle a little too hard when you stagger out of the bar
>She was already looking pretty wiped before you even started
>The events in each room are set up vary similarly to before, with only a few minor changes to account for the space and attendance
>The other partygoers don’t even seem too invested
>They remind you of movie extras, paid just to be in the background
>Halloween was a blur of excitement, but now it feels like forcing through the motions a second time
>And with Volfa being a little tipsier, she stumbles through most of it
>Knocking over tables, missing targets in games, getting stuck in the web maze
>She’s even more worn out than you when you end up in the same kind of monster-mouth room with gums for cushions
>”Hah, hah. Man, we did all that and still have the whole night!” she hoots
>”I think we could probably do another whole lap around the place, maybe even two! Where are those trolls? I need something to hit!”
>It’s time to put your foot down
>”What’s wrong, Little Red? Don’t tell me you’re throwing in the towel already! Come on!”
>You didn’t go throw the whole Halloween gauntlet just to see her so out of character from the wolfess you knew before
>”B-but…this night’s about YOU, Little Red! I’ve been trying to find a way to keep us together all week, and now I just want to spend as much as I can with you! I did everything I could for this….”
>It hurts you to hear her begging, and it hurts even more to have to remind Volfa of her one rule:
>Do what you want until someone stops having fun
>She genuinely looks crushed 
>But there’s acknowledgement in her eyes, as though she’s aware she needed to hear those words from you
>”I get it…I’m sorry. I pushed you a little too hard back there. It really IS supposed to be your night, and I guess I tried to make it too much about MY memories.”
>She sighs dejectedly
>”Well, can we at least grab a few more drinks before we head back?”
>It’s a mistake to give in to her, because “a few” turns out to be borderline lethal for her
>She’s leaning on you for support as you walk her back home
>”Maybe thish is for the bess,” Volfa slurs once back in the apartment building. “I’d rather spend the night juss with my Rittle Led instead of those losers!”
>There’s a smell of fruit punch and alcohol on her breath, with the latter much more noxious
>It would be sweetly reminiscent if you weren’t so concerned about her
>She’s throwing herself over you as you enter her room
>Her full weight on you makes your knees quake
>”C’mon, let me see Big Red again!”
>It’s not a matter of if you want it or not, but that she looks so pitiful trying to win you over
>She can barely get her shirt and pants off, and by then you’re leading her to the bed and tucking her in
>Her confusion is oddly sobering for her
>”W-wait! It’s not time for sleep yet! We have the whole night for fucking! When did you turn into such a prude!?”
>You hold her tight, trying to calm her down
>”Is it my buzz? I can still show you a good time! What do you want me to do for you!?”
>She’s listing off some unbelievably raunchy sex acts, even for her
>You stand your ground and refuse to let go of her as she tries to worm from the bed
>Then she goes still
>You saw the wolfess upset not long after you met her on Halloween when you had to part ways
>You saw brief uncertainty in her promise to see you again the following morning
>You saw her fight back tears and hold down sadness when you gave each other what you thought was your last hug
>You’ve never, ever seen her outright weeping
>She’s sobbing hysterically into your chest, her willpower finally gone
>”L-Little Red…Anon, please! You’re m-my lifekin! You’re my LIFE!”
>All the air in her lungs turns into mournful howling
>It’s nothing like the music of satisfaction she gave to the city that night
>”P-please! Don’t leave me again! I don’t want anyone leaving me ever a-again! I don’t want to be ALONE again!”
>The proud, bestial woman you knew, reduced to a wailing, trembling pup
>”Anon…Anon, please….”
>Her pleas turn to whispers
>”Anon…love you….”
>Then she’s silent
>But you can still feel her mouth the words
>Only when she cries herself to sleep do you get some peace
>The last thing you ever wanted is to not have her always by your side
>Now, you almost find yourself wishing for a wholly different wolfess than the one lying in a fetal position next to you
>Wishing for your guide, your wingman, your lover
>The Volfa you met that Halloween night

>It’s a morning you wish you didn’t have to wake up to
>Your arms and chest are covered in lacerations from Volfa’s clawing embrace throughout the night
>She let go of you sometime early morning, and for a brief moment you fear she might be dead as you try rousing her
>The fatigue from the whole night on top of all the alcohol has made her utterly catatonic
>There was something she was trying to do that was wearing her out
>It wasn’t about the party, you’re sure of it
>And you’re going to finish it for her, for her sake
>You leave a quick note for her, something along the lines of, “Be back soon”
>You wonder whether it would worry her more if you left your red coat behind, as though you were leaving her a parting gift
>Or if you took it with you, as though you were taking the last piece of you out of her life
>You decide to take it with you; all the monsters know you as Little Red, even if not by name
>You find the spore mother not far outside the apartment building
>Her and most of those around her stare at you and the space where Volfa should be
>”Anon, dear, where’s Volfa? Is something wrong?”
>You ask her if there’s anything she knows about Volfa and what she was doing
>”Well, she’s been with you most of the week. Other than that I’ve seen her visiting Medafet, the apothecary, a lot recently. Probably at least once a day. Now, what’s happened with the girl?”
>You try to tell her you need to do something for her, alone
>It doesn’t do much to satisfy the spore mother
>”I hope you know exactly WHAT it is you’re doing, Anon. We may be all different kinds of monsters, but we take care of our own like family, and nobody wants to see that poor girl hurt.”
>She inflates to a much more imposing size
>Venom’s in her glare
>”You won’t make it back to the human world if you’ve done something to her.”
>You nod in fear
>Nod and ask for directions

>Medafet’s shop is the amalgamation of every unnerving idea you can think when you hear the word “witchdoctor”
>Bifurcated, unidentifiable creatures strung from the ceiling
>Jars of wisps and spirits and gazing eyeballs
>Shadowy corners where no light exists and anything could be hiding
>Shelves straining under the weight of a hundred curios
>You just assume she’s part of the display until she blows pipe smoke toward you
>A robed, emaciated feline with sickly yellow fur (or skin, as she looks entirely hairless) and beetle eyes
>She says nothing until you introduce yourself
>”Did you think I wouldn’t know the human who has been the subject of all the gossip this past week? This past MONTH?”
>It’s a little exciting to be a celebrity
>But if you can’t help Volfa, you might as well be the enemy of every monster here
>”You’ve met just about everyone in Gulchgut, Anon, but you’ve waited until now to come to me? Well, better late than never. Volfa has told me SO much about you.”
>Medafet bares her teeth in the most Cheshire smile you wish you hadn’t seen
>”In fact, she is so infatuated with you that she’d use a pet name, one she obviously NEVER uses except only in the intimacy of your company.”
>A slender hand with overgrown nails reaches forward and strokes your red hooded jacket
>”How many times do you think she’s called you by that name? More than your real one at this point? More than any of her family’s names? Oh, she would do anything to have you….”
>Noises around the shop chime and clatter, as though taunting you with every word from the cat
>”Which is why she returns to me day after day with a tribute, hoping I can help her find some way to be with you forever.”
>”Sometimes it’s coin and gems…”
>”Sometimes it’s rare and dangerous ingredients…”
>”Sometimes it’s her dearest possessions.”
>You think back to Volfa’s bare neck with guilt
>”But alas, it’s never quite enough to gratify me. What she asks is not something I can so frivolously hand out. I need something of VALUE in this exchange….”
>She grows, standing to full height that seems almost impeded by the cramped shop ceiling
>From out of her robes she pulls a horrifying instrument
>A twisted fusion of dagger and syringe, with dried gore on its blade
>”So then, Anon, what would you give to me in exchange for what your Volfa seeks?”
>”All your wealth? Some blood? A limb?”
>”Your life?
>”Your soul?”
>Yes
>Anything
>Everything
>You won’t let a single obstacle stand in your way
>Medafet chuckles, making her whole body rise and fall
>”What a predictable response. They all say that just before they run with their tails between their legs, even abandoning the thing they love most.”
>”And yet, I shouldn’t dismiss your answer as insincere just yet. I hope to be pleasantly surprised someday.”
>”Now, how about this one: would you rather be together with Volfa forever, or wish to see her happy?”
>Both
>”Yes, of course, hero. But if you had to choose-“
>Both
>Anything
>Everything
>Whatever it takes
>Medafet gives you an unimpressed look
>Does she think you’re mocking the seriousness of her questions?
>Does she think you’re lying?
>She lifts her weapon high into the air and throws it down with a sickening THUNK
>It sticks into a table, vibrating slightly from the impact
>Her whole body arcs over you like the crescent moon
>And she smiles
>Not mischievously, but in merriment
>”That’s all I needed to hear.”
>From out of your view she pulls a small wooden box, an exquisite cherry wood with not a speck of dust on it
>”This is what she wants.”
>That’s it?
>You won?
>Just like that?
>”My sweet Anon, Volfa is very dear to my heart. I was a midwife to her mother through her pregnancy, though she likely has no idea. I wanted to watch her grow from afar, and I doubt her father ever let on what he knows.”
>”And speaking of her old man, I was the one who persuaded him to accept you into our world when Volfa’s requests were denied. I needed to see this ‘Anon’ she has gushed about for the last several weeks.”
>The whole thing feels incredulous
>You’re still reeling from what was impending death seconds ago
>Now you’re trying to take in everything the cat is saying, hoping it’s not a cruel joke
>”Yes, I wrote the ‘ doctor’s excuse’ she gave him. Your ‘official’ lifekin with her, in writing. But, I didn’t give her what she wants most now, because I needed to make sure her love was authentic. She’s proven her loyalty, but I needed to hear it come from you as well. It worried me each day I saw her without you by her side.”
>When an intimidating figure like Medafet looks sad, there’s something that magnifies the emotion to its fullest level
>Her face is the very embodiment of the “tragedy” mask
>”But, I’m sure she kept you away from here because she didn’t want to show her vulnerability, her weakness. It truly pained me to have a solution for her troubles but have to deny her so many times, and when I saw her last, there was something in her I never expected:”
>”Defeat.”
>”She knew her time was running out, which is why she wanted to spend her last few moments with you, and not divulge to you the life she could have given you if successful to spare you from the disappointment.”
>”But, nobody should have to witness a girl miserable like that. I still have a heart after all these years. Please, take this.”
>You accept the box from her, and she holds up a finger for patience
>”And, this as well.”
>From behind a counter she pulls out a folded pile of clothes
>Specifically, a nightgown and a bonnet
>”I’m sure she would like these back. It was an endearing gesture as one of her tributes, but they don’t exactly fit me.”
>You thank her for all she’s done
>Even though her methods are a little terrifying, motioning to the instrument stuck in the table
>”What can I say,” Medafet shrugs, “I enjoy messing with people.”

>You rush back to Volfa’s place, ignoring the confused looks and inquiries of the monsters
>You fling the door open and see her gazing at your note solemnly, as though it was truly the last thing you left her
>The wolfess quickly turns to you with an aching smile
>”I’m…glad you came back. I mean, I knew you wouldn’t leave without a proper goodbye, right?”
>You drop your gifts just in time to avoid getting smothered by Volfa’s embrace.
>”But, any time away from you…it’s hell, ya’ know? Now I can see what I put you through every morning I left you alone in our bed.”
>She’s burying into your comfort, almost breaking down again
>”I don’t ever want to wake up without you there, Anon. And I never want to be the idiot who leaves you in the first place.”
>You pat her reassuringly, trying to turn her to see the gifts
>She notices the costume first, looking like she’s seen a ghost
>Or rather, what YOU would look like, since ghosts are pretty much as abundant as squirrels here
>”How did you get that back?”
>She picks the nightgown up, revealing the box underneath
>”And what’s…that?”
>You tell her you don’t really know, but it’s from Medafet
>Volfa, on the other hand, seems to know exactly what it is the moment you say the cat’s name
>”H-how!? Do you know how long I’ve been trying to get something like this from her? What did you even GIVE her?”
>The truth, you reply
>She pries the lid off, almost snapping it from its hinges
>It surprises you more than her to see her jeweled choker sitting on a small velvet cushion inside
>It’s a little underwhelming, you have to admit, though you’re still happy she got her heirloom back
>But this is supposed to be the answer to your problems?
>Volfa secures the choker around her plush scruff, right where it belongs
>The jewels radiate more than usual in the mid-morning light
>She gives you another backbreaking hug, and the warmth from her neck feels as though you’re wearing the choker as well
>When she backs off, she’s holding your shoulders
>”So, what d’ya think?”
>It’s absolutely gorgeous
>But again, how does it help your situation?
>There’s a smug grin on her face as she spins you around
>In the cramped space on the mirror not covered in posters, framed as though in a collage, are two happy faces
>Both human
>The girl beside you unmistakably has Volfa’s dark hair, golden eyes, and bountiful spirit
>A spitting image of her mother, hanging on the wall nearby with her own sweetheart
>”So, NOW what do you think?”
>It’s an incredible illusion
>Though you still prefer your wolfess fuzzier
>”HAH! I had a feeling you’d say that!”
>She gives you a thorough lick on the cheek, which looks a little odd coming from the human girl in the mirror
>”It’s a glamour charm. It’s not going to be fooling a lot of monsters, but humans and anything they look through are going to see just the disguise.” 
>You’re spun back around to meet face-to-face with your wolfess love
>”The only other thing that can tell the difference is the unbroken gaze of my Little Red. Going back to the human world is never going to be a hurdle again!”
>She brandishes her arm around the whole room
>”Gotta be honest, I’d prefer to have us live here as your permanent home, but I’d love to meet your friends and family. Plus, we gotta make a return to Freak Fair next year, right?”
>But what about getting back and forth between worlds? What about the rules?
>Volfa gives you a wicked look
>”Don’t you worry. My old man bet me that if I ever found a way to convincingly blend in with humans, he’d give us TOTAL exemption from those stupid travel rules. Well, I fucking hope he likes the taste of crow, because I'm going to be shoving his little wager down all three of his throats!”
>You bop the wolfess on the nose playfully
>Her tongue ejects like a cash register
>”Man, I’m so glad she let me have this back,” Volfa says, tapping the jewels on her choker, “and it’s a pretty nice box to keep it in! Not that I’m ever going to take it off again….”
>Come to think of it, the box did seem unusually heavy
>You remove the cushion, and Volfa sputters in embarrassment
>”H-ha ha…well, when I told Medafet how much I love you, I might have…heh…ran my mouth off about some pretty loft dreams for our future.”
>Hidden at the bottom of the box are two vials: one red, and one gold
>There’s writing above each of them respectively
>”His”
>”Hers”
>And an etching of a heart between them
>”When you’re ready, of course,” she laughs. “No rush. I mean, if you still want to, ah….”
>You lean into Volfa for an impassioned kiss
>The choker warms up between you, comfortably
>You pause for air and a chance to get another good look at her wild attractiveness
>When you go in for more, she wraps her arm around your neck and tussles your hair roughly
>She pulls your crimson hood over your head and brings you in for another hug, blinding you to all but her dark fur
>”And I hope you never stop wearing this, either!” she says, patting your back
>That might make SOME things a little complicated, you think
>She laughs
>”How many times am I going to have to say it to you, Little Red?”
>Even without seeing her face, you can imagine the look of rapture she has
>And you can hear the waver in her voice
>”We’ll make it work.”
