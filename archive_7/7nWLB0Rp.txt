Anon and Joe arrive at the coroner's office to look at the body
">Well...let's go talk to wojowski" Joe says as he shuts the car door.
Anon walks into a cold storage room of bodies to see a possum jotting things down on his notepad standing over a human on a slab which is probably the victim.
">Hey Doc" joe takes his hat off.
>"Hi, Dr Wojowski? My special agent Anon I'm with the-"
Anon is cut off abruptly.
">Yeah Yeah Yeah yeah, I know I'm not stupid so how you liking Red Wood, nice huh."
Wojowski was talking like he's running out of oxygen or had 20 cups of coffee.
">Yeah it's-"
Apparently Anon was too slow and Wojowski interrupted him again.
">Too bad all the bumpkins and paw draggers around here though, not me though, I don't have time to care about that stuff So you want the deets?"

He stares into anon's eyes while smacking his pen on his notepad rapidly waiting for a response. Wojowski starts anywhere impatiently.
">Okay, female; goes by the name Annie Black
19-years old, died by blunt force trauma to the skull died instantly, had 2.5 volume of alcohol in her blood stream, 1 gram of cocaine in her system and a partridge in a pear tree"
Anon finding Wojowski joke inappropriate ignores him and looks back at Joe.
">Do we have any suspect's Joe?"
">A few Anon,but nothing concrete,"
Joe rubs his forehead disappointed.
">How about witnesses Joe did somebody see anything?"
>No...no one has come forward but... she did have a friend we were going to question"
">Should we start with them first Joe?"
">No you should probably ask the trees first, now if you Hardy boys could please leave my workplace I would very much like to get back to work"
Wojowski chimed in to the conversation jotting down own his notepad as he gestures for Joe and Anon to leave.
">Okay we'll check it out thanks doc" Joe puts his hat back on and Joe and Anon walk out the coroner's office back to the car leaving the quirky opossum to his work.
