	You hug your zip-up hoodie closer as the biting wind from the bay blows through again.  While you aren’t in the best part of town, it is still a pretty respectable spot that allows you to charge more than what a minimum wage would cover.  Used to be coming to this apartment brought you so much happiness.  It was a home away from home.  Now every time you see the white walls and blue borders, you get a feeling of dread.  Seems like every week you have to come over because something breaks, and almost always Xiao Yu is involved.  Get a brand new boiler system installed, and somehow she manages to deprive her entire floor of hot water.  Breaks the washing machine because she forgot she had a huge rock in her clothes for ‘some reason’ she says.  Her AC busts because she keeps her window open as it runs and lets it run all day and night to ‘cool off’.  Broken windows, floor indents, leaky pipes, moldy walls, and everytime Xiao Yu shrugs, not sure how she let it happen before proceeding to explain exactly how she let it happen.  When it first happened you thought her naivete would be funny, cute even.  Now it’s just ball-grating annoying.  Really her saving grace has been her making her payments regularly.  Until now.  Time to find out why.
You head up the stairs to the second floor, pulling out a ring of keys.  You’re hit with a wave of nostalgia as you remember running down these halls, playing with the other tenants’ kids.  Looks the same.  Same paint, same smells, same mystery stain in the corner.  You freeze in front of the unit.  You stand there for a minute, before pushing your childhood memories down.  This is business.  Pulling out a ring of keys, you knock on the door as you look for the key to the lock.
	
	"Mrs. Yu, it's your landlord Anon.  You're a week late on your rent." you call out.  Silence.  You give another courtesy knock, louder.  "Mrs. Yu, are you in there?"

	You hear moaning, before a voice says, just barely loud enough to hear.  "N-now's a bad time Mister Anon.  Sir.  C-can you come back a-another time?  I am in-" Whatever else she says is drowned out by a nearby train roaring by.  The 3:15 is early.  
You find the key you were searching for, and unlock her door.  "Mrs. Yu, I'm coming in, we need to discuss your arrangements."   Before she can reply, you push open the door.  The moment you do, a blast of a musky, thick stench hits your nostrils.  Like an unwashed animal that rubbed itself on everything.  Great, the A/C in the room must be busted as well.  Again.  "Mrs. Yu" you call out as you step into the living room.

	Still no reply.  "Mrs. Yu, I know you're here" that sounds kind of dumb, but you've never had to deal with this kind of situation before.  You look around the apartment.  Everything is the same yet different  Everything that you used to remember being here is gone.  The cupboard where you stored all the video games your grandmother bought for you is gone, in its place is a small table DVD player connected to nothing.  The couch where you slept during your teenage years when you needed a break from your parents was replaced by a small table draped by a transparent table cloth.  Fuck, you feel bad now.

	You hear a quiet moan coming from the door next to the couch.  "I-I'm in the kitchen" she calls out.  That heady smell gets stronger the further you move in.  This isn't just the smell of a mature uplift there's something else to it.  Slowly, you push the door open, spotting the panda grasping at the table in the middle of the room, hunched over.  She’s rubbing her crotch against the table’s corner, white panties so drenched in her juices that it is completely see through, liquid dribbling down her leg and collecting on the floor.  You follow the trail of dribble, going from the kitchen to the atrium where you entered.  The coin finally drops.  

	You barely get to say “Ah shit” before a five foot tall Panda girl tackles you to the ground, face pressed against you as she inhales your scent, dragging her nose all the way to your neck, sloppily lapping at your chin and face with her tongue.  "Oh Anon, your smell, your taste” she moans as she rubs her crotch against your legs. “I need this so bad!"  Your brain locks up as you try in vain to remember what you read in a pamphlet about dealing with uplifts in heat.  She grabs your arms, pinning you down  as she licks every inch of your face, savoring your taste.  Then one word pops into your head.  ‘Run’.  

	You attempt to pry the horny panda mother off of you, succeeding partially.  She is surprised by your resistance, falling away but she doggedly clings to your hoodie.  You quickly unzip it with your free hand and pull free, Xiao Yu flopping to the ground still tightly wrapped around the sleeve.  “Wait!” she calls out, but you’re already out the door.  

	You don’t stop running until you reach the parking lot, grasping your car as you catch your breath.  You’re sweating bullets, your heart is up in your neck, and you have a raging boner.  Uplifts in heat are a problem, but they rarely get this serious.  Most cases, an uplift is able to stay sane enough to informs employers and landlords about their heat in advance to stop this sort of mix up from happening.  Even then there’s tranquilizers designed to even Uplifts out for severe cases. Certainly Xiao Yu would know herself enough to get some.

	Unless she wanted this to happen...maybe she wanted it...wanted...you?  Holy fuck no!  What are you thinking?!  That’s just assuming way too much!  But she’s never missed a rent payment before, even when she was sick or injured, she managed to mail her check.  No, this is estrus, way different circumstance than a flu or a sprained ankle.  Maybe she just forgot to take her tranqs.  Maybe she just forgot to tell you.  She isn’t really the brightest bulb.  But she was basically asking you for it!  But that would be wrong since it isn’t really her, it’s her heat talking.  But that’s the thing, she’s in heat.  She needs someone to help her through this.  Maybe she was hoping you could keep her under control.  And if you aren’t gonna help her, she might do something she’ll really regret when she comes down.  It’s not uncommon to hear about an Uplift in heat going out and humping the first thing with legs in public, then getting rounded up by the cops and forcibly neutered.  It’s lead to a lot of anti-Uplift sentiment, and you really don’t want to see Xiao Yu on the receiving end of that.  You have your problems with her, she has more accidents than any other tenant and her trouble with big words does grate on your nerves, but you don’t want the poor girl getting punished so severely for a mistake.  

	Slowly you make your way back up to the second floor, heart racing in your chest.  Xiao Yu’s door is still open, you can hear her inside, a mixture of moans and sobs.  Slowly you creak the door open, your stomach in knots.  She’s still where you left her, rubbing your jacket between her legs with one hand as she simultaneously chews and sniffs on its sleeve.  “No…” she cries out in a small voice.  You closing the door gets her attention as she snaps up.  In an eyeblink you’re once again pinned.  You have no idea where this woman is getting that strength of speed from!  “Oh Anon” she breathes into your ear as she rubs her crotch against yours.  “Please don’t go again, I need help.”

	She feels your boner and smiles “And I think you want to help” she laughs.  Pulling you away from the wall, she guides you to into the hall.  You don’t resist.  She kicks a door open, revealing a painfully pink room with two beds.  “Is this your daughter’s room?” you ask before she throws you down onto the closest mattress practically ripping your pants off as you fall back.  Your dick flops out in the open, making Xiao Yu squeal in delight.  “Cock…” she whispers she whispers as she grasps your member, stroking your length with one soft hand while she rubs your crown with her other index finger.   Whatever fear you had evaporates as you feel those silken pads of her hands caress your sensitive prick.  It takes almost no effort for her to bring you to climax, as you feel yourself getting achingly close.  You grunt as you feel something rising, coursing up your dick.  Xiao Yu picks up on your queue, lowering her head over your cock.  You thrust up as your first spurt of seed hits her face.  Then the next her tongue as she engulfs your cock head in her mouth, gently suckling your as her tongue caresses your tip, lapping your seed as quickly as it comes out.  Holy shit.  You don’t think you’ve ever cum so hard before, your dick pulsating as you shoot a seemingly endless stream of your gooey juice into her waiting throat.

	“Fffffuck” you murmur when you finally stop.  Xiao Yu however doesn’t stop, pulling your skin back as she swallows more of your dick into her throat, her tongue feeling like a mix of razors and cotton as it grazes your over sensitive underside. “Wait” you groan out “Let me recover first!”

	Xiao Yu doesn’t listen as she continues to blow you, seemingly fixated on getting you hard again with single minded determination.  Thankfully you haven’t shot one off in weeks so it’s real easy for you to stand at full erection again.  When she no longe feels any floppiness in your boner does she thankfully pull away, a thin trail of saliva between your glistening dick and her lips.  Ready for you, she clambers onto the bed, rubbing your wet meat against her already sopping cleft, her breathing fast and heavy.  Wait, when did she get her clothes off?  “Mmmm Anon” she moans as she mashes her breasts with her hands “Anon Anon Anon Anon” she says your name over and over, bouncing your name in her mouth like just saying it gives her pleasure.  Her hands move up her neck to her face, running her fingers through her hair.  “Ready or not, here I come!”
Using only her thighs and the stiffness of your erection, she lines her pussy in place, her wet entrance kissing your urethra for a single moment before your part her folds, sinking into her hot vagina.  Every inch of her burns with intense lust, her walls wrapping and caressing your dick as it tries to push you back out and suck you in at the same time, desperate to start fucking.  Xiao Yu’s eyes roll up as he arches her head back, moaning louder than you’ve ever heard her before.  Despite the chub around her belly, her insides feel like pure muscle as she squeezes your cock, blood pulsing through her as she starts bouncing, grasping your knees for balance.  

	Clearly experienced in the art of love making, she doesn’t even start with a slow thrust.  Instead she opts for a clever maneuver, pulling herself up as her arms push down on your legs, the upside of your dick peeking out at you as she thrusts her pussy in your direction before pulling back, sinking back down, giving the sensation that can only be described as ‘otherworldly’.  You reach up to grasp at her hips, trying to gain some semblance of control over the pace of the fucking, but Xiao Yu’s wild bucking throws them off again and again, coating your arms in her climax as she shouts out again.  Her femcum sprays across your body, her legs shake as she is wracked by orgasm after orgasm, threatening to toss her off.

	This is your chance.  With herculean effort you reach up and grab the panda milf.  She exclaims in surprise as you wrestle her down.  Now she’s on the bed and you’re up top! Xiao Yu smiles hungrily, hands grasping at your shoulders.  She wanted this!  Well lucky for her so do you.  You push her legs up, driving your prick into her puss, your head poking at her cervix as you start to piston into her, the overwhelming stench of arousal and the pleasure of her vagina driving rational thought from your mind.  “Do it Anon!” Xiao Yu yells, just as delirious as you.  “Claim me!  Mark my womb!  Make me your bitch!”

	The floodgates are open.  If your last orgasm was big, then this one was a fucking deluge of cum!  You flood her pussy with her cum as you instinctively continue to thrust, the pressure of your cock forcing your thick, white seed out as you pump more into her.  Xiao Yu hugs you close, nails digging into your back as her final climax hits her body.  She roars out in pleasure as your waist is splattered with a fine sheen of her orgasm.  It’s over in moments that stretch on into eternity.  You stay in her warm embrace, idly fondling her breasts as you both bask in the afterglow.  

	With a sigh, you pull out of her arms, your now soft penis flopping free of her pussy.  Xiao Yu follows up, grasping at your waist as she takes your semen coated cock into her mouth, sucking hard.  Okay not this time.  “Wait god dammit!” you shout as you pop your semi hard dick out of her mouth.  Xiao Yu looks hurt as she gazes up at you, a bit of your seed dripping from the side of her mouth.  “Didn’t you like it Anon?”

	“Well yes, but that’s not why, I mean this isn’t the reason I’m originally here!” you snap, much more harshly than you intended.  Xiao Yu winces as you continue on.  “I came because you missed your rent, and when I come here I find out you are in the middle of estrus, not just any estrus, but the worst case I’ve ever seen!  Why? Why did you let it go this far?  Why didn’t you do something about your  problem beforehand?”

	Xiao Yu avoids your gaze as a hand idly plays with her hair.  “I’m sorry.  I was desperate.  I'm not used being in es-estu-esr" she struggles with the word “being in estrsus-being in heat alone.” she eventually gives up.  “And well you’re the only human I know now and...” she trails off, looking at the mess she made on her daughter’s bed.

	“What do you mean only human?  What does that have to do with anything.”

	Xiao Yu puts a hand to her cheek, as if her fur wasn’t enough to hide her embarrassment.  She doesn’t need to say it, you figured it out on your own.
	
	“You fucked your old owner didn’t you”

	She slowly nods, turning to you.   “Yes, when I was still a Pet, I helped keep my owner company after his wife died.  He said how much I reminded him of her.  When I had my first heat, he...well” she plays with her fingers “well he had me.  And I loved it.  Since that time, every time I was in heat, we would have sex, and even when I wasn’t he would do it with me.  It was fun, and it felt real good. All the way to the end.”

	“And when you say ‘the end’ you mean-”

	Tears start to well up in Xiao Yu’s eyes.  “Master died.  I was at the hospital, and they said he died from a car-cardio-carding at-” she stuttered, trying to remember the right word and not cry at the same time. 

	“Cardiac Arrest” you step in.  Xiao Yu nods, sniffling.

	“It happened so soon.  After he had a stroke.  I still don’t know what a stroke is!” she cries.  “He was fine one day, then a second later, he falls on his head, shaking.  I-i try to call the ambulant, and they came to save him, but they didn’t save him and then the doctors say he had a heart thing and then I-” she starts to rant hysterically, hyperventilating.  You put a hand on her shoulder.  She freezes and remembers you’re there, looking up at you.  “And then...he died.”

	She takes a moment to collect herself before she continues “After that I found he left me a huge trust fund, and let me go.  This was long after the Anti-Pet laws, so I never learned about anything besides keeping him happy.  I had no idea how to live independently, but I was forced into it.  I also had my two daughters to take care of, and no one in his family seemed to like me.  So I had to go.  Your apartment was the first one I found.”  Her breathing starts to get heavy again.  “This was my first heat alone,  away from any human and it feels so...wrong!  Like a hole is in my and it’s empty part burns so hot!  I need to be with a human Anon, I need you!”  And now the pieces start falling into place.

	“So let me get this straight” you say.  “You need me to have sex with you?  Like literally need it?”  Xiao Yu nods.  “And you missed your rent knowing I’d come knocking?”  Xiao Yu looks like she’s ready to cry and suck you dick at the same time.
 
	“Please don’t leave me!  I promise I’ll warn you from now on!  I won’t forget to pay.  Just please, I need a human to love me again.” she moans, hugging your arm, squishing her legs together as her arousal comes back.  “Please…”

	Fuck, she looks pathetic, and you’d be lying if you said you didn’t find her attractive.  Your hardening dick is proof of that.  You grab your fallen pants, Xiao Yu following your movements.  You grab a StamUp from your pocket, an over the counter booster meant to take your gene mods and amp them up to 11 for a while.  “First off” you say as you hold the StamUp to your neck.  “I can only do this during the day.  I still have others to take care of back home” she nods as you press the plunger.  You hear a ‘snap’ sound and you feel a prick against your neck for a split second.  “Second, no freaky stuff without telling me first” Xiao Yu nods again, looking happier with every passing moment. “Third, tell me when you’re kids come home so we don’t run into them before I leave.”

	“Oh you don’t have to worry about that” Xiao you excitedly exclaims.  “They’re sleeping over at a friend’s house while I wait out my heat.  They’ll be gone all week!”  She gets off her daughter’s bed, trailing her arousal and your seed across the floor.  “So, Anon” she whispers as she drapes her arms around you “Ready for round two?”

******************************************************************************************************************************** 
    
    You were ready for round two.  More than ready for three.  Rounds four through six you were starting to get sore.  You stopped keeping track after round ten.  All you know is that by the time Xiao Yu was finally satisfied and sound asleep, the sun had already set.  

	Fuck.  Even with your booster, you barely kept up with that girl’s insatiable libido.  You fucked her on both her daughter’s beds, you fucked her on the floor, you fucked her on the kitchen counter, on the kitchen table, on the sofa, in the bathroom shower, and so many places, you’re sure you left your cum splattered over every square inch of that apartment.  By the end you left her in her bedroom sound asleep, fur crusty with layers of dried sweat and semen.  Treating yourself to an extra long shower to wash away the scent of horny Panda, you drove home, trying desperately to keep your eyes open.  Oh wait.  You still had to feed the Mollys…

********************************************************************************************************************************

    “Anon’s back!” One of the Mollys shouts.  You haven’t even closed the door before three doberman Uplifts swarm you.
    
	You’re not sure if it’s the dog in them or if they genuinely happy you manage to come home, but they always do this every day you come home.  Well for the most part.  Usually after you have to pry them off or lure them away with food.  This is the first time they jump away.  They stare at you like you’re made of poison.  “Something wrong girls?”
    
	“That smell.” Submissive Molly says.
    
	“You’ve been with a woman haven’t you?” asks Passive Molly.
    
	Damn.  You took an extra long shower, washing yourself three times, even scrubbing your crotch raw, and they could still smell Xiao Yu on you.  You were hoping to avoid the awkward questions when you came home.  Guess that’s not gonna happen.  You sigh “Yes girls, I’ve...well I’ll just say it I...slept.  With.  Uh” you cough and quietly finish “panda...uplift.  And I’m probably gonna do it again.  See she’s in heat and...” you trail off waving your hand around.
   
	You weren’t sure how they’d react, but they seem to just stare dumbfounded at you.  You just stand uncomfortably in front of them as they fidget around, until you finally decide to break the silence, holding up a greasy bag of fast food  “I also brought burgers home.”
    
	“Oh...okay” Assertive Molly replies,  slowly reaching out to grab the bag.  They retreat to the kitchen slowly, not at all like they usually do, screaming and laughing and pulling you along.  
    
	“Is something wrong with grandma?” you ask.  You don’t get a reply.  Now you’re worried.  You run to the guest bedroom, throwing the door open.  Your grandmother is still in bed, looking to you in dull surprise.
    
	“Oh.  Who are you?” she asks.  You are filled with relief and concern as your grandmother appears to be the same as usual.  “I’m your grandson.” you reply.
    
	“I have a grandson?”
    
	“Two.”
    
	“I have two grandsons?”
    
	“Yes.”
    
	“Oh.  Are you married yet?  You look old enough to be married.”
    
	“No grandma, I’m not...well I’m in a complicated relationship

	“That’s stupid.  Just fuck a girl and marry her.  It’s how your grandfather and I got together.  Where is my dog?”
    
	“Molly died grandma.  You have uplifts now.  You don’t call them dog.  You call them Pets.”
    
	“Why?”
    
	“Because they are uplifts.”
    
	“Okay.  What are their names?”
    
	“Molly.”
    
	“Molly and…”
    
	“You named them all Molly.”
    
	“Why would I do something as stupid as that?” 
    
	“I don’t know grandma.”

    “Grandma?  Are you my grandson?”

    “Yes grandma, go back to sleep.”

    “Okay sure.  I’m tired anyway.  You can explain all this in the morning.”

    Grandma seems to be doing fine.  It took her longer to forget you were her grandson that usual.  You have no idea what it is that is upsetting the Mollys.

	By the time you get to the kitchen, the bag has been emptied, the dishes cleaned up.  Normally the Mollys would wait around and tease and beg you for your burger.  This time they left in on the table, still wrapped.  Very strange.  
    
	After dinner, you retire to your bedroom, writing an email to your boss why you’ll need a week off, and writing up a list of things you’ll need tomorrow.  You exhausted your supply of boosters, you’re gonna need more.  That panda was insatiable.  This is usually time when you’d just play some multiplayer games until you were too tired to read the chat, but you’re already exhausted.  Barely getting out of your pants, you crawl into bed and collapse.
    
	You are roused when you hear your door open, three pairs of feet shuffling as quietly as they can along your wooden floor.  “You think Anon’s really going to leave us?” you hear one of the Mollys whisper.
    
	“No, he can’t.  He won’t right?” one of them replies.
    
	“I...I don’t know.”

	The Mollys think you’re still asleep as they crawl into your bed.  Three arms drape around your as they hug their bodies close, enveloping you in fuzzy, warm dog fur.  

    “I don’t want Anon to leave.”  You only fall asleep after you hear them softly snoring.
