>You are Anon, Ex military man turned Stay at home father
>Times were going great for you and your friends, Chick had flown you to meet Jasmine's parents as well
>Never one to let someone else shoulder all the festivities, you offered to host the New years party at your house
>In the days since returning home you had taken Clara shooting with her new Makarov
>At first when she shot it her fur poofed up adorably, her paws unused to recoil
>You showed her the right holding techniques, how to reload and how to clean it
>In the end she was visibly excited to have a gun of her own
>"I wanna make them! I think it'll be fun do you think I can?" she said as she practically vibrated next to you as you drove home
>You always encouraged her to toy with new hobbies so you found a gun-smithing class at a nearby college and Used your GI Bill to enroll you both in the classes
>To think being shot at a few times meant free college
>Clara was ecstatic to hear about the classes
>Emi offered to Babysit Lucatiel while you were both in class
>But that didn't matter right now as you cleaned the house
>So much to be done for the party
>Replace the sheets and wash the blankets of the guest room bedroom, clean the Cats litter box etc
>You didnt mind being a stay at home husband at all
>How could you? you got time to explore your various hobbies and take care of Lucatiel
>Your bedroom was stop number 1 in your cleaning rampage
>The sheets and blankets stripped from your bed, you begin putting new sheets on
>But as you tuck the sheets under the mattress on your wife's side you feel something
>You sigh
>She didnt need to hide her various toys
>Honestly it not like you arent used to it by now
>You grip the thing but its not one of her toys
>Pulling it out from under the mattress reveals a notebook, big enough to write on easily but small enough to fit into a purse
>You turn it over and see the words "Da book of Grudges" written in what appears to be Crayon
>Huh? What the fuck?
>You open it and flip through a few pages
>LOTS of names and descriptions of how they had wronged her 
>And how she got revenge or planned too
>Some were crossed out and some were circled
>They varied from "Ate my Lunch at work, add extra hot wasabi to his lunch whenever the chance arises"
>To "Stole my favorite parking spot, pour cat piss on brake pads"
>You're actually proud she did that one, you taught her it after all
>If you pour piss on someones brakepads, every time they stop their car it smells like burnt piss
>But you did wonder where she would get the cat pee, the thought of the litter box hidden in one of the closets floats through your head
>You flip through it lazily, most of the stuff was childish, both in action and revenge
>However a few names pop out to you
>"Bingle :Ruined the one chance I had to get with Jasmine" He had a whole page to himself which was covered in tiny drawn skulls
>"Chick: Took Jasmine off the dating market!"
>What came after that made you laugh
>"He gets death!" thats scratched out followed by "I cant kill him maybe hubby will" followed by "Hubby is too good of friends with him" followed by "Ok I like him he's forgiven" followed by "QUIT FLIRTING WITH MOMO!" and a bunch of tiny drawn skulls
>You snap the book shut and set it on her pillow
>You're gonna have to ask about this later
>The cleaning continues before you jump into your jeep and head to the store
>You needed to get Alamo beer for Chick and some Voodoo ranger beer
>Whats a new years party without beer?
>As well you needed party food plus ribs, steak and oysters
>Its gonna be great!

>Shopping was quick and easy because you were still able to get onto the Base nearby
>The exchange and Commissary had everything you needed
>The drinks were in the fridge, the party food spread out
>The grill was ready to go too, you know that Lilith likes her ribs done a certain way that only the mechanic can get right
>Clara would be home soon with Emi, after all they worked together as nurses
>Plus Momo was still looking after Lucatiel so you didn't have to worry about her
>When you tried to tell her how to handle Lucatiel's fits she shooed you away
>"I've raised more cubs than you have Anon!" she said
>Well you had to give her that one
>As you go around finishing putting finishing touches on everything and picking up the last few things you hear the door open
>"Hey Babe we're home!" You hear Clara call out
>You head to the door and see Clara and Emi in their nurse scrubs setting their purses and such on the front hall table
>"Hey babe how was work?" you say as you walk up to Clara and Give her a quick kiss
>"Aww wheres my kiss?" Emi pouts 
>You look to Clara who smiles and winks at you
>Whatevers clever 
>You give Emi a quick kiss as well
>"Work was fine, Some idiot managed to stab himself with a replica Master sword"
>You smile
>Their stories for how people hurt themselves in creative ways were always interesting
>"Let us change real quick Babe. When are the others going to arrive?"
>"Uh soon, Chick and Jas will be here soon I know, the mechanic and Lil will come a bit later"
>She smiles at you then pulls Emi to the bedroom
>"Come on you silly tiger, lets change!"
>You they disappear around the corner you hear Emi's protests
>"I got covered in blood and bile let me shower Clara!"
>After that a door slams and you only hear muffled words and a shower kick on
>God those two cats would be the death of you
>You sit down an start playing some bloodborne
>One of your viewers from your streams requested a specific weapon only run
>It just happened to be a weapon you hated
>God dam you had to edit this footage so much
>It was literally you getting murdered over and over
>WHY THIS WEAPON!? It's a god dam walking stick
>As you get more and more frustrated your door bell rings
>You hear muffled talking before you open the door
>"-terally says do not ring cub sleeping! You want him to show up at our place and ring the doorbell when we have our cubs!?" you hear Chick talking to Jasmine about the "knock please" sign taped above your doorbell
>Chick and Jasmine are here and it looks like they took Jasmine refurbished Volkswagen
>"No beat up Pontiac today Chick?" you Chide as they walk in
>"Fuck off it's better than that Chevy piece of shit"
>You laugh as you close the door behind them
>"whatever man, I got the Alamo stuff you like in the fridge, Jasmine I have water and the "preggo special" that Clara liked when she was pregnant"
>Clara drank pickle juice when she was Pregnant, which was a bit weird to you but you also recall reading it was good for muscle soreness
>Jasmine smiles at you and hugs you "Thanks for having us over Strong"
>"Hey Chick I gotta thank you mother-in-law, Clara loves her little Makarov and wants us to make guns together, so I signed us up for a class"
>He looks up over the door of your fridge, eye patch glowing from the light
>"Make guns? You mean you'll be able to do that?"
>"Chicky don't get TOO excited! he said he's gonna take a class on it not that he's gonna be an expert"
>Chick closes the door, a beer in his hand
>"Oh please! The last time he said he's gonna take a class on something he turned into a master ammo loader, he doesn't do mediocre BS"
>You frown slightly
>"What?! I like what I do and I do what I like! just because I enjoy making bullets doesn't mean I'm the best"
>Chick frowns and almost physically brushes your words aside
>"Ever since you've been out of the military all you do is make everyone else in the field look like amateurs, that's why I get ammo from you" 
>You sigh and sit back on your couch
>"Hey Chick how good are you at Bloodborne?"
>He laughs as your character gets eaten by a Giant fish man "I'm decent but it's more fun to watch you fuck up"
>Fuck 
>You give up playing with the stupidest weapon in the game and put on a Big-O, an old favorite of yours
>God dam those pile bunker fists made you want to punch stuff
>"Ooooo I LOVE this show!" Jasmine says as she throws herself on your couch a jar of pickle juice held in her paws
>You smile and look to chick who is still in the kitchen inspecting the steaks and ribs
>"Hey may not be able to get that perfect Texan Marinade right but I can still make them good! The grill is ready if you wanna make them perfect for you and Jasmine"
>Grilling is an art, and you knew everyone had specific ways they wanted things grilled
>So how better to get food perfect than to let your guests perfect their own food?
>having learned the specific marinade for each group you had 4 bags of steaks in marinades
>One for you and Clara, one for Mechanic and Lilith one for jasmine and Chick and one for Emi
>Jasmine sits wide eyed as Big-O punches another robot, Chick busies himself with the Grill and you head to the bedroom to get Clara and Emi
>When you enter Clara is sitting on the bed with her book in her lap, the sound of the hairdryer going tells you Emi is almost ready 
>"How much of this did you see Anon?" Clara asks with a few tears in her eyes
>"Uh enough, Look Clara I don't care if you hold a few grudges but refrain from writing you wanna murder them, honestly even chick killed people for GOOD reasons, not they kill them because they cockblocked you"
>Whats the female term for cock block?
>Vag dammed? Clam Jam? Taco blocko?
>Whatever!
>"But I have some really personal stuff in here Anon! I Love Chick but he hit on my mom!"
>You clear your throat 
>"Uh I think Momo was hitting on him Clara, besides everyone holds grudges, just not everyone has them written in a book"
>Clara eyes you momentarily
>"Promise you arent Mad about it?"
>You scooch forward onto the bed and give her a quick kiss "Promise"
>She smiles at you, "Don't worry you aren't in it!" 
>Before long, Emi Emerges from the the bathroom looking fluffier than normal
>"OH Anon! I didn't know you would be here! Otherwise I would have grabbed a towel"
>She is totally nude, as you look her up and down
>"It's fine Emi, Jasmine and Chick are here and I still need to introduce you to them"
>She smiles half-heartedly
>"You sure you want to introduce me to them? I don't know if your friends will like that I've slept with you both"
>You wave your hand brushing her excuses aside
>"Clara already told them of our unique situation and so have I, they accept our lifestyle"
>She shuffles a bit on her footpaws
>"You sure Anon?"
>Heh usually she's much more bold than this
>"Yes I'm sure, I'll go tell them you're BOTH getting ready"
>You shoot a sideways glance to Clara, who hastily shoves her book under the mattress again
>Leaving the bedroom you hear Emi shuffling through the closet for some cloths 
>You can already smell The steaks Chick is grilling as you hear Jasmine cheering "big O big O!"
>Before long Emi and Clara emerge from the bedroom together
>You stand up and give Clara a quick Hug before taking Emi By the Paw and leading her over to Jasmine
>"Jasmine This is our friend Emi; Emi, this is Jasmine"
>Emi nervously shuffles on her paws  
>"Emi? OH! That Emi! Hi Emi its nice to finally meet you!"
>Jasmine is already standing and bounds forwards a bit to shake Emi's Paws happily
>"It's nice to meet you too Jasmine, Clara has told me so much about you! Your fur is so pretty!"
>You beam as they both sit on the couch chatting, Clara joins them 
>Emi is of course very interested in Jasmines pregnancy, girl stuff you figure
>There is a slight knock from the door so you answer it revealing The Mechanic and Lilith
>"Hey guys glad you could make it! Beer is in the fridge, Mech the ribs and steaks for you are labeled"
>Lilith gives you a quick hug before zooming past you to join Clara Jasmine and Emi
>You give a slight fist bump to the mechanic as he walks in carrying a box of fireworks
>The door closes on its own behind you and you go to introduce Mech to Emi
>"Hey Emi this is the Mechanic and Lilith!"
>Lilith waves excitedly "Hi Emi! Nice to meet you!"
>Emi Smiles and waves
>"Hi its nice to meet you all! uh Why do you go by Mechanic?"
>Mech scratches his head, and sets the box down
>"You ever notice how like everyone is Named Anon? I don't have a fancy Nickname so I just went with my job"
>Chick comes in carrying a plate with His and Jasmine's Steaks
>"Hey Mech. Grills all cleaned and ready for you"
>As Chick sets the plates down Jasmine puts a padded fingers to her chin
>"Hm now that you mention it a lot of people from your world are named Anon, at least the ones I meet anyway"
>Chick nods and sits next to her as Clara gets up from the couch to grab a Diet coke
>"It was one of the most popular names for many years. People are fickle. At least we aren't all named Earl. Or John. Or Hugo."
>Jasmine sips from her jar of pickle juice and Chick eyes it
>"Is that stuff really good Jas?"
>Clara plops down next to him on the couch and answer for Jasmine
>"Yea I couldn't get enough of the stuff when I was Preggo! Try it Chick!"
>Jasmine hands him the jar and He sips it reluctantly
>The face he pulls makes you choke on your drink because of how funny it looks
>"Well that was...interesting. Can you grab me another beer, I need to wash that taste out of my mouth"
>"Sure thing" you laugh as you grab a beer from the fridge
>"Catch" 
>You toss it to him casually
>He attempts to catch it but misses
>The beer makes a solid *THUNK* as it hits him in the head
>"Oh Fuck are yo-"
>He nonchalantly picks up the beer and opens it 
>Fizzy beer sprays everywhere as he tries to drink
>"Chicky? You ok? What happened?"
>He sets the beer on a coaster
>"My depth perceptions a bit off" he says pointing to his eye patch
>You mentally slap yourself
>"What happened anyway Chick? Did jasmine get you again?" Lilith asks in confusion as the Mechanic heads outside with a plate of ribs and Steaks
>Jasmine's fur Poofs out
>"I DID NOT!"
>"Sureeee you didn't Jas. Look at all those other scars he has from you" Clara says rubbing a paw on one of the scars on Chick's arm
>Jasmine angrily buries her face the jar of pickle juice, muffled Russian is heard as she yells angrily into it
>Clara giggles at this causing even more angry yelling
>Emi to the rescue though, scavenging the whole situation
>"Hey Jasmine how do you get your fur so white? I've wanted to dye my fur like that or like a golden tiger, but no dyes I've used can cut it"
>Jasmine pulls her muzzle out of the Jar and licks away any residue from it
>"Oh uhm, its this way naturally, I'm a Hybrid Emi, my mom is a tiger and my father is a Mountain Lion, this is my natural fur color"
>you watch as Emi eyes Jasmine up and down
>"Your fur is so Exotic looking and pretty, I had hoped you could point me in the right direction for Dyes"
>Lilith interjects
>"Oh oh I know some good fur dyes!"
>everyone looks at her
>she shrugs
>"What? I had a rebellious streak when I was in foster care! If they can dye MY fur they can dye yours Emi"
>She motions to the black portions of her fur 
>You lean against a wall and sip your beer watching your best friends in the world talk
>A beautiful scene to say the very least
>You think back to your time in the military, your higher ups telling you to go out more
>Your workmates telling you not to volunteer for every deployment possible, telling you to live life
>So this what they meant?
>After your family died a void had filled your heart, and you thought you could fill it with patriotism
>But seeing everyone told you that it hadn't
>Chick, Jasmine, Lilith, the Mechanic, Emi and Clara
>You didnt feel it anymore, the void finally full
>But you had one more thing to do before you cooked the steaks for you Clara and Emi
>"Hey hey! We need to say hi to Armas and Faye in the mythical land of Finns"
>"Oh right! Timezones! Ok lets says hi" says Clara as she bounces happily next to Emi
>You smile as you hook up everything
>The webcam is ready and you click the video call button on your laptop
>A few moments later and Armas and Faye anwser, speech totally synchronized
>"HEEEELLLOOO From the world of Tomorrow!" Faye yells as we waves violently
>"Hello from the world of Yesteryear" Jasmine says with a smile
>"Hey all just checking in! How was Christmas and how are Mikael and Aura?" Clara asks
>"one sec"
>The camera on their end turns revealing a large Christmas tree and the children passed out on the couch
>"they tried to make it to midnight but no luck! You actually called right as he was going to carry them to bed" Faye says off camera
>You smile as the camera pans back around
>"Anyway we gotta go! Thanks for checking in!" 
>"Bye!" Lilith says with a wave
>The call ends and everyone goes back to their spot on the couch


>The food was great, the count down to the new year came and went
>The New year Started and you were sure that it would be great
>You had your best friends with you to start it out
>But you could see them all starting to get tired
>Beer, champagne, other various drinks all weighed down their eyelids
>The Mechanic and Lilith already turned in
>"Babe can we do that cuddle thing again with Emi this time?" Clara asks with a yawn
>You look to Jasmine and chick
>"We don't have a nest bed, but we can pull the Mattresses into the living room here"
>Clara's eyes light up and she bounces slightly
>"That OK with you guys?" you ask to Jasmine and Chick
>"Ok! I wouldn't mind! What about you Chicky?" 
>Chick had a few more beers and drinks that you and was sitting with a smile on his face, watching Jasmine talk 
>"Mmmkay, Jas have I told you how beautiful you look? And also you guys are the best"
>You suppress a laugh as Clara and Emi swoon
>"Yes you have Chicky but thank you"
>Clara swats you with a fluffy paw
>"How come you never say things like that?"
>You look at her with disbelief on your face
>"I tell you that EVERY day"
>She stomps her footpaw 
>"Yea but not like that! Its not the same!"
>This Snep
>You decide to drop it and get the things needed for the cuddle bundle that was incoming
>"Girls if I could have your help moving the Mattresses from the master bedroom and the guestroom"
>Clara and Emi nod at you and head to the bedroom
>"Can i Help too?" Jasmine says looking from you to a very inebriated Chick
>"No moving heavy stuff why Pregnant Jasmine, just keep Loverboy here company while we set up"
>"Mmmf screw you Strong" Chick mumbles as he snuggles into Jasmine
>You smirk and head to the bedroom and begin the process of moving the mattresses
>Luckily with Emi and Clara helping it doesn't take too long
>2 king size mattresses lay side by side on the floor, with plenty of Blankets and pillows for everyone
>even your cat which seems to have taken a liking too Chick, more so than usual
>Clara opens a window slightly to let a little bit of brisk winter air in as you all get into bed
>You lay with Emi to your right, cuddled up to you with a paw on your Chest
>Clara to your left with her muzzle in the the crook of your neck, her paw on top of Emi's
>Jasmine is next to her Spooning Chick happily with her content purring
>you catch a peek of Clara's and Jasmines tail intertwining with each other
>And lastly Chick asleep being the small spoon to Jasmine
>Your Cat laying on his feet
>You smile as you slowly drift off to sleep with the sound of Emi's soft breathing, and Clara's purring in your ears
>This year was going to be great
>A whole new year with all new fun
