BORN ON THE BAYOU

>Be Anon
>You were 25 years of age, standing at 5'10".
>You made your living as a fisherman, casting out lines and nets into the swampy waters of the massive river delta where you kept your home.
>It was a peaceful existence.
>Well, except for the 'Gators.
>They weren't usually a problem, as they most of the time kept to themselves.
>Recently though, they had been getting a bit... Curious. About you.
>It had all started when a Gator girl had gotten tangled up in one of your fishing nets.
>She looked pissed as she laid on the deck, immobilized. 
>You had quickly released her, cutting her out the net, trying not to focus on the sight of her naked body.
>You had even given her a crate  of the fish you had caught that day to hopefully quell her anger.
>Instead of biting your head off, her expression had softened as she held the gift. 
>She plopped down onto the deck with a thud, and began to eat the small crate of fish. 
>When she finished eating, she had stood up and given you a tight hug, before diving off the side of the boat, swimming back under the murky water.
>Since then, you had seen multiple female Gators swimming near your cottage.
>You had even seen them out of the water a couple times, either sitting on your dock or inspecting the outside of your home.
>At first you had been pretty scared of them, but you quickly realized that they didn't have any malicious intents towards you. They hadn't even tried to approach you yet.
>Just... Observe you.
>It was a bit creepy having a small group of them standing at your window, staring at you as you moved about inside.

>Currently you were standing on your dock, loading fish out of the boat and onto an associate's truck. The elderly man would sell it in town and then return with your cut of the profits.
>He glances at the two Gator girls staring at you from within a cluster of reeds.
>He leans out of the car window, and calls out to you.
>"Hey, young feller! You notice you got a 'bit of a 'Gator problem?"
>You tell him that you didn't really consider them a problem. They just hung around your property, looking at you.
>Upon hearing you say this, he freezes for a moment.
>Then he starts laughing and hooting, showing off the few teeth he had left.
>He looks at you as he winds down, tears in his eyes as he grins at you.
>"Boy, you know what that means, right?"
>"They's be trying to court you!"
>Your eyes widen, and you ask him what he means.
>"Boy, I've lived on this damn wetland my whole life. Believe me when I say that I know how Gators behave."
>"That's what they do when they see a potential mate. They watch 'em!"
>You panic a bit, asking what you did to draw their attention.
>He taps a finger against the steering wheel of his truck, thinking. 
>"Well... That I'm not too sure about. Do you remember doing anythin' to them that might've drawn their attention?"
>You instantly think back to when you snagged one of them in your net.
>You quickly tell the old man how you had accidentally caught one, before giving it a crate of fish and letting it leave.
>He snaps his finger at you, a knowing expression on his wrinkled face.
>"Yep, that'll do it. You gave her a gift. She probably thought you were hittin' on her or somethin'. They must all see you as a potential mate now."
>Well, shit. That explains the large amount of Gators around your property.
>You ask him if there's anything you can do, but he just shrugs.
>"Sorry boy, but I've got no clue. Them God-dang Gators can be more stubborn than a damn Mule."
>"Maybe just try and ignore them. If you're lucky, they just might go away."
>You don't reply, and the two of you remain silent as you finish loading the fish.
>Soon enough, you finish. The old man calls out to you as he starts the truck.
>"Alright, I'll be back on Sunday with the cash, as per our usual agreement. Until then, try not to get your pecker chewed off!"
>With a cackle, he drives off, leaving you alone with the group of large, scaled women.

>It had been a couple days since the old man had left, and since then you had been very cautious around the Gator women.
>You kept your curtains drawn, trying to block their sight of you.
>Unfortunately, it had the opposite effect. They simply tried harder to get your attention. Some had even taking to exposing themselves to you, bending over and spreading themselves open as you walked by.
>You had tried consulting the fine men of 4chan for their advice on what to do, but they hadn't been much help. Most of them just called you a faggot for not even attempting to fuck one of the large women.
>One poster had actually been pretty helpful, though. He had told you that Gator women, when courting someone, would never initiate an intimate encounter. All they really did was try and entice males into approaching them. When they got ahold of a male though, they would become possessive, not letting any other female try to claim him. 
>You were currently sitting at your kitchen table, trying to enjoy a pleasant sandwich. 
>It was a bit difficult though, as a large Gator was standing at the window, smooshing her tits against the glass as she stared at you.
>You had to admit. It was starting to get to you.
>You didn't really pull a lot of women with the whole "swamp fisherman" routine. It had been... some time since you last shared a bed with someone.
>Having a dozen women constantly trying to lure you into mating with them was -almost- a welcome change.
>You stare at the woman as she rubs her nipples against the window, creating small smudges on the glass.
>She gave you a toothy smile as you watched her.
>You aren't sure if it's because of your loneliness, but you find yourself thinking that maybe it wouldn't be so bad to be a Gator's husband. 
>After all, they didn't seem very hostile... Better yet, if the poster from 4chan was right, they would even try to keep you safe from others.
>You let out a sigh as you go over to the window.
>The Gator seems positively giddy as you approach her, a wide smile on her face.
>When you shut the curtains however, you hear a frustrated huff, and the sounds of her stomping away from the window. You sigh, sitting back down in the chair. You were going to have to head into town soon to buy some more food. You couldn't live off just fish and sandwiches.
>You make a mental note to try and head into town tomorrow. It would be nice to get away from all the Gators, even if it's only for a couple hours.

>The next day during the late afternoon, you grab your keys and wallet.
>You head outside your cottage, shutting the door behind you.
>Before you can lock it though, you're distracted by a Gator slapping her ass and whistling at you. You had no clue Gators could whistle, and it makes you smile as you slip your keys into your pocket.
>Your car had been broken down for a month or so now, and you had no clue what was wrong with it. You were more of a boat guy when it came to mechanics.
>Town was only a 40 minute walk away though, so it didn't matter too much. 
>You unlock your shed, and drag out a hand-cart so you can more easily get your groceries home.
>You walk past some Gator girls, all of them trying to entice you with their bodies.
>Some were bending over for you, others were hefting their tits, and one was even straight up masturbating in front of you.
>You manage to resist their charms, and head to the edge of your property.
>Walking onto the road leading off of your property, you begin to head down towards the town.

>Three hours later, you shuffle back down the road to your house yawning.
>It was getting dark out, and the long walk in the humid summer air had taken a lot out of you.
>Atleat you had picked up plenty of food.
>You slowly push the heavy, food-laden cart until you arrive back at your home.
>All you really wanted to do at this point was shower and go to sleep. The same thing you did every night.
>When you get to the door, you stick the key in but notice something strange.
>Fuck, you had never even locked it in the first place!
>You quickly open up the door and look around.
>Nothing immediately seems out of place, so you drag the cart inside and shut the door, being sure to lock it this time.
>Turning on the lights, you can see that everything looks the same as how you left it.
>You think so, anyways.
>You spend the next several minutes putting food away in the cupboard and fridge.
>There should be enough stuff to last you a couple weeks.
>After you finish putting stufd away, you head into the bathroom. 
>You don't bother grabbing clothes from your room. You kept towels in the bathroom and you didn't mind walking the four feet between the bedroom and bathroom naked.
>You shuck off your clothes, tossing them into the hamper.
>Climbing into the shower, you adjust it to an acceptable temperature, then focus on getting youself clean.

>Soon enough, you finish up in the shower.
>You dry yourself off with a fresh towel, then hang it up to dry.
>You step out into the hallway naked, before opening up the door to your bedroom.
>You turn on the light, and what you see makes you freeze.
>Theres a large Anthro Gator girl laying spread eagle on your bed.
>Damn! She must have slipped in here after you left. 
>The sight of her naked body spread out just for you makes your traitorous dick spring up, ready for action.
>The Gator seems to take great interest in this, one hand gesturing for you to come closer. Her other hand is slowly rubbing her dripping folds.
>You look down at your cock, then up at the Gator. She's waiting for you.
>... Fuck it.
>Yeah, this is happening.
>You grip your dick, and walk over to the excited Gator woman.
>You pause for a second. Your bed was only twin-size, and there was no room for the two of you on it.
>Hell, there was barely room for her!
>As if to answer your question, in a quick burst of speed, her arms shoot forward and grab your arms, pulling you on top of her until you're laying on her like a mattress. 
>One of her arms is swung over you, ensuring that you don't slip off.
>Your face is pressed against one of her big green tits, the nipple the size of the tip of your pinky.
>You're diamonds at this point, and your dick is squashed up against her soaking wet cunt.
>With a quick little shove, you slowly enter the Gator girl, drawing out a shiver from her.
>As you slowly ease yourself into her, she suddenly thrusts her hips up at you, forcing you in to the hilt.
>The two of you gasp, before you start to slowly thrust into her, getting into a rhythm as she wiggles her hips under you.
>Her insides were a bit cooler than you had expected, likely from her being a reptile.
>But goddamn if they didn't feel like heaven. She had complete control of her muscles, and she was using them to milk your dick like a cow.
>In response, you begin to thrust harder into her, eliciting a low groan of approval as her arm tightens around you.
>When you feel her first orgasm hit her, you slow down a bit, but you speed up again when you feel her clawed hand grip you tighter, and she even growls a bit. Looks like she likes it hard.
>You oblige, showing her no mercy as you pound into her.

>Several minutes later, she's gone through a few more climaxes, but still shows no signs of slowing down.
>You on the other hand, are soaked in sweat and starting to lose steam. You could only hold back from cumming inside of her for a bit longer.
>You're about to blow your load when suddenly she grabs you by the shoulders and spins around, flipping you onto your back.
>She straddles you, resting her weight on the sides of the mattress. 
>She has a hungry look in her eyes, and it scares you.
>For some reason, it only makes you harder. Huh, fearboners are real. Who would've thought? 
>She a bit of her weight onto you, grinding against your tortured dick. 
>Your cock easily slips inside of her soaking wet gash, and you can hear her let out a deep rumble of approval.
>May God have mercy on your pelvis.
>She leans forward, her hands gripping you shoulders.
>She grins salaciously at you, before slamming down on your dick, riding you like a saddle.
>She pounds you deep into the bed, the wood creaking and groaning as it takes the abusive weight.
>You were making similar noises, hilting her each time she slammed down into you.
>Her tongue flops out of her mouth, painting you in thick saliva as it glides along your face. 
>You can only take so much of this, and you cry out as you feel your climax hit.
>You cum deep inside of her, shooting your seed directly into her reptilian womb.
>She cries out in delight as she feels you fill her up with your jizz.
>As you lay there panting, doing your best to recover, she takes her weight off of you, your dick sliding out of her.
>A thick blob of fluid slides out of her cunt, a mixture of your shared juices.
>She pulls you into a tight embrace, gently flipping over so that you were laying on her stomache like it was your mattress. 
>She gently strokes your head, cooing at you.
>Between the long walk you had earlier and the rough lovemaking, you find yourself totally wiped.
>You close your eyes, and the only thing you can hear is the beating of your lover's heart.
>You fall asleep on top of her, completely spent.

>The next couple months are spent together in bliss.
>After they saw that you had finally claimed one of them, the other Gator women had backed off, leaving you with your new mate.
>The old man had thought it was hilarious that you had a actually taken one of the Gators as a wife, but he quickly learned to shut up about it when your lover growled at him.
>She was with you almost constantly, following you almost wherever you went. 
>You had even managed to teach her how to help you fish.
>Pulling in nets was a lot easier now that you had a quarter-ton Gator wife to help you lift them out of the water.
>After you had introduced her to the concept of television, her second favorite thing to do was lie down on the couch with you and watch game-shows, even if she didn't understand them. You had to lie down on top of her, of course. She didn't allow you to sit any other way.
>Her favorite thing to do was to have you fuck her, which usually happened whenever you layed on top of her. Which was pretty often.
>Your balls never remained full for very long.
>Sure, your pelvis MIGHT not be in the greatest shape, and you find yourself walking a bit funny after each love-making session, but you were infatuated with her.
>And you knew she would never leave you.
