>You're anon
>Stuck in community college for some business degree
>It's dull, but not terrible
>Even got your own apartment last year
>You kill the time how you can
>Even if it means browsing those 'WOLFED' threads on your Albanian recipe board
>You know it's weird, especially when your best friend is a wolf
>But it's not that weird, she was your friend before you even knew they existed
>Or does that make it worse?
>You could go around in circles trying to justify yourself for hours
>You always come to the same conclusion
>Doesn't matter, you're just friends
>You've finished up class for today, on your way home now
>Having another argument with yourself over whether or not you're a creep
>You sigh in defeat as you fiddle with the lock to your apartment
>The door swings open, and you're blindsided by a wall of fur
"Anon!"
>That's Annette, your best friend
>The wolfess squeezes you in a hug, and you swear you can hear your ribs creak
"Hey Annette, good to see you."
>You manage to speak, and that satisfies her
>Annette lets you drop to the ground
>A voice calls from deeper within your apartment
"You gotta tell your girlfriend to stop breaking in."
>That's Geoff, your roommate
>He's a jackass, in the metaphorical, and literal sense. A donkey
"Annette's not my girlfriend Geoff. And you were there when I gave her a key."
>Geoff appears down the hallway, shrugging as he walks past you and Annette
"Whatever you say man. My half of the rent is on the counter."
>And then he's gone, off to class.
>Leaving you and Annette in the apartment
>You lead the way back to your bedroom
>It's small, but Annette likes to call it 'cozy'
>To make you feel better, you think
"So how was class Anon? Learn anything fun?"
>You scoff as you flop onto your bed
"Bullshit psych class. I learned nothing."
>Gotta love degree requirements.
"How 'bout you Annie? Are you saving lives yet?"
>She brightens, sitting on the bed next to you
"Not yet, but I got the outline for my big project! I'm doing tension pneumothorax! I already have a plan for the video I'm gonna do, and I talked to a nurse..."
>Annette goes on about her big project for her trauma class
>You don't understand most of the bigger words, but you're more than happy to listen
>She's always so happy to talk about the many ways a body can get fucked up
>And how to fix it
>You give a few token responses, even trying to ask a relevant question
>Every time you do, Annette flashes you her big cheery grin
>It's kind of amazing she ever bothered with you
>It's like the social butterfly, and the antisocial moth
"Oh, hey Anon, I got some homework I gotta do, mind if I use your computer?"
>Her question snaps you out of your musings, and you sit up on the bed
"Huh? Oh, yeah, go for it. Toss me my book while you're over there."
>Annette fixes you with another of her chest breaking hugs
"Thanks Anon! You're the best."
>She does this every time you do the slightest thing
>It'd be annoying if she wasn't so happy all the damn time
>Anette jumps off your bed
>It's only a half step for her to cross over to your desk and pull open your laptop
>While she's at it, she tosses you your book
>A worn out copy of the entirety of The Lord of the Rings
>This is your three-hundredth read through of the thing
>It makes you happy
>You're settling in to start reading when Annette makes a soft squeaking sound
>You look up
"Annie? You alright there?"
"Huh? Oh, yeah. I'm fine Anon, I just uh, was checking my grades. I got a B on my last quiz."
"You got a B? Horse shit, lemme see." 
>You jump up, but Annette turns, blocking the screen
"Really Anon, it's nothing."
"Oh, I get it. Don't want me to see you doing bad?"
>You smirk, trying to show you're joking
>Annette laughs it off
"That's it. Just lemme get to work."
>You shrug and drop back on the bed
>Not that it mattered
>One B wouldn't hurt her perfect grades
>The afternoon passes, Annette fiddling with your computer while you read your book
>A comfortable silence fills the room and you lay back on the bed again
>Eventually you hear the click of your laptop closing
>You look over to see Annette standing
>Something's up
>She looks nervous
"A-Anon?"
"Yeah Annette? Are you okay?"
>She makes that same squeaking noise before going for the door
"Imfinegottagobye!"
>She's gone before you can stand up to follow her
>The front door is shut and locked by the time you get there
>You sometimes forget how fast Annette can be
>Oh well, you'll see her friday for her play
>She had a small part in some comedy about a restaurant
>She got you two free tickets
"In case there's someone you wanted to bring."
>She had said
>You return to your laptop, with homework of your own you'd been putting off
>You open it up, and the screen powers on
>Revealing the WOLFED thread you'd been shitposting in the night before
>Holy
>Fucking
>Shit
>You stare at the scree, mouth hanging open
>Annette definitely saw it
>She probably read the whole thing
>Even your stupid post lamenting that there was no big wolf girl that would hunt you down
>Oh my god you're a fucking weirdo, and a creep, and an asshole
>You didn't even think of her that way, but now she'll think you do
>You're about to lose your only friend because you're a freak
>Fucking fuck
>The rest of the week passes like a dream
>Annette doesn't text, she doesn't call, she doesn't ambush you at your front door
>Geoff picked up on your daze on Thursday
"So Annette finally told you huh?"
>He leaned on your doorway, munching on an apple in a way he knew you hated
>Jackass
"Tell me what?"
>Geoff gives a braying laugh
"So she didn't tell you."
"Didn't tell me what? What are you tallking about?"
>Geoff just turned and walked down to his room
"Humans man..."
>Friday comes around
>No class on Fridays
>Just the play
>You show up, alone like you planned, and sit in the back, in the darkest corner you can find
>All you can remember is when Annette's on stage
>She's good
>The show ends, and the lights come up, you're moving to make a hasty exit
>You glance up at the stage as the actors bow, and Annette is staring right at you
>You freeze, unsure of what to do for several seconds
>You duck your head and run for the exit
>You make it pretty far, all things considered
>All the way to the arts building lobby
>Your hand is on the door when you're blindsided by a wall of fur
"Anon! You made it!"
>Annette picks you up off your feet with this hug
>She's hugging extra hard this time, you can hardly breath
"Annie...crushing me..."
>You're dropped to the ground, but Annette still holds you close
>You feel her take a deep breath as she leans her head down against your shoulder
"Uh...Annette?"
>Letting you go, she grins, back to her usual cheerful self it seems
"I'm so glad to see you Anon. It's been a long week."
>You nod, unsure what to say to her
"Listen, Annette, when you were over the other day--"
>Anette grabs your hand, and starts dragging you outside.
"There's gonna be an afterparty at my place. You have to come!"
"Your place?"
>You had never been, Annette always just invited herself over to yours
>Annette drags you out into the night
>Once you're on the street she lets go of your hand, only to put an arm around your shoulder
>That's new
"It'll be great, you can meet all my theater friends, and I made a cake..."
>But she's talking like she used to
>Maybe you're lucky, she decided to pretend it never happened
>Maybe things are back to normal
>Annette seems to be taking the long way, leading you across campus
>Not that you mind, you're happy to have your friend back
>She seems more talkative than normal, every once and a while she stops talking just to catch her breath
>She's even huffing a little, taking long breaths in
>Probably nothing
>As you're crossing through the park, Annette stops, looking down to you
"Oh gosh, Anon, I'm so sorry! I was so excited you've barely said a thing! How are you doing?"
>You offer a grin
"It's fine. I'm doing good Annie. I'm glad that you've--"
"And how's that big wolf girl you're dreaming about?"
>Annette is staring at you
>Like she wants to tear you to shreds
"Annie, wait, hang on--"
>She grabs you, and forces her mouth against yours in a rough kiss
>Breaking it, she pants
"Now run, little human boy. Or you'll be eaten alive."
>Despite Annette's instruction, you're frozen to the spot
>Her gaze is fixed on you
>You could honestly believe she was about to kill and eat you
>This must be what deer feel like when they cross a busy street
>Annette barks
>Honest to god barks
"Go!"
>That's all it takes
>You turn and sprint into the park
>You make it thirty feet, and turn to check on Annette
>She's watching, crouched low like a sprinter at the starting line
>But she springs up, pointing past you
"Anon!"
>You turn, just in time to run face first into a tree
>Fucking ow
>You bounce, falling back onto your ass
>Immediately blood starts gushing from your nose
>Annette is beside you in a flash, her mouth running a mile a minutes
"OhgodAnonImsosorryareyouokayyourebleedingholdstillletmetakealook!"
>Annette looks you over as you try to hold by the flood from your nostrils
>Every time you touch your nose it causes a wave of pain
>You think you just broke your nose
>Annette whines as she help you to your feet
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry Anon."
>You try to wave her off, but you stumble a little as you stand
>Despite your best efforts, you fail to keep your blood from dripping on Annette
>You frown as the white fur on her arms stains red
"I'm okay Annie. I'm fine. I think the clinic is still open."
>Annette doesn't remove herself from you the entire walk there
>Arm around you, stopping to check the bleeding every ten steps
>All the while apologizing like her life depends on it
"Look, Annie, I'll be fine. I'm just in a lot of pain."
>You smile to try and reassure her
>Blood dribbles into your mouth and you cough
>This just sets off another round of apologies from Annette
>It's a relief to make it to the clinic
-
>Annette is waiting for you in the lobby when the doctor lets you out
>She hugs you again, much gentler this time
"Heya Annie."
>Your voice is nasally, the doctor plugged up your nose with gauze
>Annette pulls out of the hug, looking down at you
"Are you alright? What did he say?"
"Just a broken nose. Not even a bad one. Gotta ice it, and not touch it. How does it look?"
>Annette chews her lip
"Uh...it's uh, not great."
>You figured as much
>Not like you were getting any prettier
"I think I'm gonna head home and lay down. You have fun at your party."
>You kind of want to put this night behind you
>You're sure Annette does too
>The kiss was nice though
>Annette grabs your hand
"I'm staying with you. This is my fault."
>Your head is throbbing, your face hurts, and you're still a little mad about all this
>But you can't say no when she's giving you the puppy-dog eyes
"Alright. Let's just go."
>You step out of the clinic, with she-wolf in tow
-
>The walk home is quiet
>Annette follows behind you, not speaking
>You don't feel the need to break the silence
>Especially with your headache
>You make it home without a word passed between you
"Yo Geoff?"
>You call into the empty apartment
>Must be at one of his night classes
>Lucky you
>Annette is still silent when the pair of you step into your bedroom
>You flick on the lights and drop down onto the bed
>Looking up at Annette, you see the fur on her face wet with tears
"Annie, what's wrong?"
>She drops down onto the bed next to you, wilting into your arms as she starts crying
"I'm such an idiot. So stupid."
>You hug her close, trying to comfort her as best you can
"It's alright Annie. I've gotcha."
>Annette continues to cry on your shoulder as you hold her
"I'm not mad Annie. I'm really not. I wasn't looking where I was going."
>She sniffles, pulling back to look at you, big blue eyes still watery
"Y-you mean it Anon? You're sure you're okay?"
>You nod
"Just a broken nose. I've had worse."
>You laugh, and then instantly regret it
"Ugh. Ow."
>Annette wraps around you again, whining in sympathy
"I was so dumb, listening to their advice..."
>Oh god, she didn't
"Annie, whose advice did you listen to?"
"On your website. I asked how I should 'w-wolf' you."
"The people on that site are morons Annie. I'm surprised they didn't tell you to pin me down the moment you saw me."
"They did. A lot of them did."
>You're not shocked by this revalation
>You can't help but laugh
>Annette joins you, giggling a little
"There. Feeling better?"
"Mm-hmm."
>You sigh in relief
>You're not even mad anymore
>Annette just has that effect on you
>There's just one last piece of unfinished business
"So you were really gonna jump my bones, huh?"
>You feel Annette stiffen in your arms
"Uh..."
"It's alright Annie. But you could have just talked to me, you know."
>Annette starts to relax, pulling back to look you in the eye
"Anon, I really, really like you. Like that?"
"Perfect."
>You lean in and kiss her
>It's a little clumsy, and you taste like old blood
>Annette squeezes you like she usually does
>Her embrace keeps the kiss going, Annette opens her mouth to force her tongue into your own mouth
>Your tongues slide over eachother for a brief, heavenly moment before Annette pulls back
"You know what this means, Anon?"
>You catch your breath, cocking your head
"What?"
>Annette giggles
"You've been wolfed."
