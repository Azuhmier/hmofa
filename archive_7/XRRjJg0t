>Fast breathing, tightly wrapped arms, and a damp shoulder greet you when you stir awake with a groan.
>"A-Anon?" The voice is quiet, feminine, worried.
>You bolt awake when you realize what's going on.
"Shhhh… It's alright, honey. Everything's fine. I'm here for you."
>Only sobs meet your voice.
>You rub the big yeen's back, running fur-less fingers through soft tan fluff.
>A few minutes of this helps her cool down enough to breathe evenly again.
"You okay Mallory?"
>A bolt of lightning strikes nearby, and she hunkers down around you again.
>"M-my-my l-l-egs... I c-can-n't feel m-my legs..."
>You feel her shake against you, tears starting to flow freely again.
>She used to love the rain and the thunder.
"Just lean into me, Mal. You're in my arms hon. I'm here. You're right here at home in my arms."
>Fuck those motherfucking hajjis.
>Fuck their villages.
>Fuck their lands.
>Fuck their oil.
>Fuck 'em all.
>You dare a glance at the clock over the hyena’s shoulder.
>0322 in bright red lettering glares back at you.
"Mal?"
>"A-Anon?"
"I love you."
>The proud soldier looks up with teary eyes, unflinching even at the loud report of another lightning bolt.
>"I-I love you t-too, Anon."
>She seems to calm down after that, seeming to remember where she is.
>The yeen steadies, and you find yourself drifting with her into slumber once more...
---
>You wake up to the yeen you love petting your head softly.
>You grumble, but nuzzle into her bosom lovingly.
>"Morning, Anon."
"Bad dream?"
>She just pets you a few minutes longer.
>"We need to get up and go, love. It's almost five."
>Another groan, and you roll away from her soft grasp and onto your feet out of the bed.
>You lazily step up to the dresser, and give a short look at her shadowbox.
>She misses the Army, sometimes.
>She always says "Fuck the desert," but you still see it in her eyes every so often.
>The way she stares at those ribbons, those ranks, those badges and photos.
>You know the hyena all too well.
>She always tells you about how she saw it as the tenth circle of hell, but you know better.
>You know, deep down beneath those spots and that thick muscle, she misses it, sometimes.
>She misses her friends.
>She misses the desert.
>She misses the pounding of the .50.
>She misses her legs.
>Medical discharge, honorable of course.
>Sent home with a bronze star (with valor), purple heart, and a week in the hospital.
>She'd been lucky. Guy in the passenger seat lost his legs *and* his dick.
>Poor Lieutenant Avery.
>Rest of the Humvee got out with minor head trauma.
>Hajjis hadn't set the explosives right, only half the load went off.
>You would only have a flag if those idiots weren't such fuckups.
>Fuck.
>You and your love don't get many days off together, unfortunately.
>Fortunately you do get paid enough for Mallory's prosthetics to not have caused a financial crisis. Fuckers are expensive.
"Hey."
>She looks up.
"Mornin' Mal."
>She smiles at your half-awake grumblings.
>If you hadn't been together so long, those teeth would be intimidating.
>Her height would be, too, if she hadn't lost half of it.
>If. So many 'If's.
>You shake yourself awake.
>Her giggles are music to your ears.
>The dresser rolls open with a tug, and you pull out a shirt and pair of pants; the ones you know she likes best.
>She sighs.
>"Shit Anon, if I didn’t work today, you and I would be fucking right now."
>No doubt she's staring at your ass.
>Well, who are you to deny her a show?
>You bend over and let her leer as you grab your socks. A quick glance behind you confirms your suspicions.
"See something you like, hon?"
>"Every day."
>You turn when you stand and watch your lovely mate shuffle and open up her wheelchair, dropping into it gracelessly.
>She's gotten quite good at that little trick, no matter how bad it looks.
>Despite how much she needs you, Mallory always strives for independence.
>How'd she put it? "I just want to be normal"?
>The walk around the bed is short
>The kiss you share with her is anything but.
>She sighs through her nose while she hangs upon your shoulders, reaching even despite your bent posture.
>You hate to break the embrace, but there's shit to do.
>"Gods, I love you Anon."
"I love you too, Mal. Bath?"
>"Hell yeah. Let me get my shit together."
>You get out of the former grunt's way and she sets about grabbing her things.
>The small bathroom isn’t much, but it's accessible, like the rest of the apartment.
>The hyena rolls in to set her fake legs, clothes, and other effects by the sink right as the water's getting warm.
>"Can I get a hand, honey?"
>Legs or no legs, she's still just as pretty and as wonderful as the day you met her.
>Russet fur and chocolate spots, amber eyes and bright emotion, white chest and pink nipples.
>She's still the girl you fell in love with.
>"Heh, you still there Anon? I mean, I do enjoy the attention, but the morning won’t last forever…"
>You realize just how long you've been staring at her nude form (and how painfully erect you are), and blush.
"Sorry... Here."
>Taking her proffered hand and lifting the naked vet into the tub, Mal giggles.
>"What would I do without you, love? Oh! That's cold!"
"Sorry, water's warm. Tub might not be yet."
>She nods.
>"Go get breakfast ready, Anon. Come get me in ten."
"Yes ma'am."
>A quick kiss, and you're off. You love it when she’s like that, all commanding and such.
>Reflecting how thick Mallory's figure is, her appetite is unending compared to yours.
>Before (and during) her deployment, she was able to just work it off by exercising. Now, however...
>It's alright though. You quite enjoy how soft her belly has gotten.
>You've become somewhat of an expert at making Mal’s preferred quick-start breakfast.
>Two eggs, some diced potato hash, and toast with butter and jam. Maybe an apple to split between the two of you if she’s feeling "fruity".
>Your breakfast is much simpler: a bowl of corn Chex and a banana.
>Oh, and there’s always Mal’s favorite part: her 'special' cookies.
>They don't work for everyone, but she practically can't go a day without at least half of one.
>She says they do wonders for all kinds of symptoms, from the ringing ears to her phantom pains.
>You also know she likes how they make her feel (plus they make her especially ticklish, for some reason).
>You just finish plating everything and start in on your cereal when you realize that it's been almost twelve full minutes since you left her.
>She hates it when you're late.
>Even running across the small apartment to her can't save you from her ire.
>In the empty tub sits a soaked, royally pissed hyena.
>Her glare is piercing, and you almost flinch from its ferocity.
>"If I were to suddenly regrow my feet, I'd have my foot so far up your ass you’d be licking my toes. Do you know how long I've been sitting here?!"
"Two minutes..."
>"TWO MIN-" she remembers she’s still in the apartment, "Two minutes! You'd have better cooked up a hell of a meal, Anon, or I'll have your ass instead!" She'll do it, too.
"S-sorry, Mal. Lost track of time."
>Nice stutter.
>"Whatever. Just hurry up and dry me off, dumbass." You get to it, sneaking a grope in when you think she’s not paying attention.
>"Hey! Quit fuckin' around and actually dry me off, damnit!"
>Some time later, and you’re helping the morph out into her seat again.
>"Alright, now get going. I've got the rest from here."
"You sure?"
>"Yes I'm sure! I'm not a baby!"
"Didn't seem like that last night."
>She shrinks a bit. Normally she takes that sort of thing like the light-hearted comment you meant it to be.
>That nightmare must've really sucked.
"Hey, you okay? You need me to leave?"
>"No! N-no. Just… stay here. With me."
>You pat her head and scritch her ears before setting your ass on the counter.
>She rolls up and starts getting her faux-limbs and work clothing on, brushing her hair, and fixing herself for her workday.
>You just sit there in companionable silence, knowing your presence at this time of day is a comfort to her.
>She finishes brushing those sharp teeth, and spits.
>"How do I look?" A worried chuckle escapes her.
"Gorgeous as always."
>"T-thanks, hon." Mallory’s blushing, and you can’t help but smile.
"Breakfast? It's probably a little cold by now, but still."
>Her emphatic nod earns a nice laugh from you, and you hop down and push the anthro female along.
>The two of you get to the table and quickly begin eating.
>Your Chex are soggy, and you know her eggs are cold by her expression, but the yeen is still grateful for the help.
>"Looks like I won't be chewing on your rear today, Anon. Thanks."
>You wipe your brow exaggeratedly, and she nearly chokes on a bite.
"So, on a more serious topic..."
>The look she gives you is worried, but open nonetheless.
>"Is it about my dream?" You nod, and she whimpers. "It was nothing t-too serious... Just the usual, trapped in the H-Humvee, again... Th-then losing feeling in my legs..." Her whimpering gets louder.
"Hey, it's alright Mal. I'm here for you, okay? No need to be ashamed."
>She perks up a bit at that.
"T-thanks Anon. I love you."
>You both finish quickly thereafter, and as Mallory grabs her work bag you retrieve the keys to the car.
>She rinses her dish out in the sink and leaves it, and you push open the blinds to see the sky just starting to lighten to a nice blue.
>"Hey, honey? We still have about half an hour until we need to leave, really."
"You want to sit on the couch and cuddle."
>Mal nods happily, and you sigh.
>A short jaunt to the couch, and you pull the dressed-up hyena into your lap.
>"Eep! Careful! I don't want to get wrinkles in my skirt."
>She pulls off her coat and hangs it on the handle of the wheelchair.
"Oh hush you. You would gladly wear wrinkled things if it meant snuggling with me a few minutes more."
>She growls, but doesn't deny it.
>You rub her belly and kiss her head, running all over her torso and chest, sometimes even copping an intimate feel.
>She sighs happily, and you both relax to the sounds of the morning: footsteps, running water, soft breathing…
>Suddenly, feeling mischievous, you curl your fingers against Mallory's sides, tickling her.
>"Aahhh! Anon! S-stop! Hahaha!" She laughs uncontrollably, squirming and flailing, helpless to escape your cruel grasp.
>You just smile lazily.
"Say you give in."
>She looks back at you, and you stop to let her breathe.
>"Never..."
"What was that?"
>"I said neve-aaaAHH!" You keep going.
"All you have to do is say you give in..."
>"I’ll never surrender to you, Anon!"
"Well then, I guess I’ll never stop tickling you."
>This keeps going a few more times, before she finally admits defeat.
>"I yield! I yield! Please, Anon! Let me go."
>You don't.
>"Anon, please. Let go!"
"Say it."
>She growls, and you press in at her flanks again, making her tense up.
>"I… I give in," the hyena says with more than just a little shame.
>You return to petting her and pinching playfully at that cute belly of hers, getting her to squeak softly every time you do.
"Battle-hardened, eh? Hehehe..."
>Your time together is then cut terribly short when you notice the time on the clock.
"Hey Mal, looks like it’s time to go."
>"Awww..."
"I know, I know. C'mon, get up."
>You push the reluctant yeen off of you and into her chair, and she starts to readjust her tie and gets her coat back on.
>Both of you make it to the door, and you hold it open for your disabled mate.
>Out the building's bottom floor and to the parking lot outside in the dark of the wee hours, you unlock your Impreza.
>You roll her down the ramp and to the passenger side of the car, and help her climb in before collapsing her chair and stuffing it into the back seat.
>It's all small talk from there, just you and Mallory riding to her work.
>Arriving, she leans over and kisses you on the cheek when you park.
"Oh honey, we can do better."
>Following up with a deeper, closer embrace as you turn off the car, you rub her back comfortingly one last time.
"Have fun at work, love."
>"Don't cause too much trouble at home, Anon."
"I won't..."
>"Good. Now help me out of here."
>You jump out and unfold the chair, opening Mal's door and carrying her into the implement.
>A final goodbye kiss, and she's wheeling to work. You wave to your love.
"Bye hon!"
>She giggles, and goes in.
>You contemplate the morning, and the gold ring around your finger.
>How lucky you are.
