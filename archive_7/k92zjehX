From a shark thread in /trash/

M/F Human X Anthro shark. Vanilla, cuddling, cute, Lesbian loves the D.

>You are Anon. 
>Currently, you're sitting alone on your couch, beer in hand, mindlessly watching the TV. 
>You're tired, your leg muscles feel particularly heavy. 
>Sometimes you wondered if working at Home Depot was a good idea. The labor kept you in shape, sure, but damn if you didn't get tired of it. 

>You take another sip of your beer as you change the channel. 
>Your phone goes off beside you, buzzing a few times on the couch, indicating you were getting a call. 
>You pick it up and look at the screen, afraid it'd be your boss calling to request you come in tomorrow for overtime. 
>But no, it's just Mischief. 
>You relax a little and answer. 

"Hey Chief, whats good?" 

>You always called the shark that, knowing how the nickname got under her skin. 
>But you're not met with the usual huff of annoyance that nickname gets you. 

>"A-Anon?" 

>The shark's voice is shaky. You can tell she's been crying. 
>The smile leaves your face almost immediately, and you lean forward in your seat. 

"Uh...everything okay, Mischief?" 

>"N-no..." Her voice is barely more than a whisper. 

"What happened?" 

>There's a pause as she steadies herself before explaining, taking a deep, shaky breath. "I-I...Mayhem and I got into a fight, a-and..." 

>She trails off, and you sigh through your nose. 
>Great, this again. 
>You should have figured. 
>Anytime she called you with a problem, it almost always involved her girlfriend Mayhem. 
>Honestly you were a little tired of it, but...well, not like you'd ever tell Mischief that. 
>Though sometimes you seriously considered giving Mayhem a piece of your mind. 

"She didn't hurt you, did she?" 

>"N-no!" Mischief quickly denies, but her voice gets quiet again soon after. "B-but...I think she...s-she..." 

>She starts crying again. 
>Her quiet sobs are a little heartbreaking to hear.

"Do you want me to come over?" 

>She sniffles. “P-please.”

>You get up, holding the phone between your ear and your shoulder as you grab your jacket off the back of the couch and slip it on. 

"I’ll be there in a few minutes, alright?” 

>”Okay…” 

>She hangs up, and you stuff your phone in your pocket. 
>Grabbing your wallet and keys, you head out the door. 
>Mischief’s apartment was about a fifteen minute walk away from your house, so there was no sense was driving. 
>You stop for a few minutes at a 7-11 to get a few items. 
>You knew this was gonna be a tearfest on her part, so it was better to have some things. 
>Swedish Fish always helped cheer her up. 
>And some Cherry coke would help you get through this with patience. 

>About 20 minutes after the phone call, you enter her apartment complex and knock on her door. 
>A few seconds pass before the door unlocks and opens. 
>Mischief is a mess. 
>Her eyes red, tears running down her cheeks. 
>Her glasses are gone, and her hair is a mess. 
>Well…at least you knew Mayhem didn’t physically hurt her. 

>”H-hey…” she says quietly.
>You try to give a supportive smile as you step inside, setting the drinks and candy down by a lamp while you sit with her on the couch, facing her. 

"So what exactly happened, Mischief?" 

>You try to sound supportive, god knows the girl looks like she needs it right about now. 
>She hugs herself, not meeting your eyes. When she speaks, her voice wavers. 

>"S-she broke up with me..." she whispers. 

>Your eyebrows raised in surprise. 
>Sure, the two went through rough patches a lot, but you never really thought you'd see it reach that point. 

"Damn...did she explain why?" 

>"S-she...she said I was t-too needy...too c-clingy..." 

>A few tears fall from her eyes onto the couch cushions. 
>With a sigh, you scoot close to her and, resting a hand on her shoulder, gently pull her close to you. 
>She hugs you tightly, and you do the same as she buries her face into your shoulder, the tears finally coming.
 
>As sobs wrack the shark's body, you rub her back slowly. 

"Hey..." You speak softly to the shark. "It's gonna be alright, Mischief..." 

>That...doesn't seem to help much.
>Her cries become a little harder, and her grip on you tightens even more, her tail even sliding around your waist. 
>You couldn't get her off even if you wanted too at this point. 

>"I-I...how could she just drop me like that? After e-everything we...?" 

>You can feel she's trembling now. 
>Frowning, you reach up with one of your hands and slowly thread it through the shark's soft hair. 
>A few seconds of this pass, and she seems to relax a little. 
>Thankful you found something that works, you keep at it, focusing your little caresses around her ears, which seems to work best. 

"I don't know, Mischief. I honestly can't tell you why..." 

>She sniffles, her head resting on your shoulder as you continue. 

"But... I mean, it is what it is...if this is what she wants to do, you really can't stop her. You've just gotta try and move past it..." 

>"I-I don't know if I can, Anon..." she whimpers. 

>You start working your fingernails into the pets, running your fingers in slow, circular patterns through the hair on the back of her head. 

"Why not?" 

>"I...I would never have even talked to her if Fracas hadn't told Mayhem I liked her. Mayhem was t-the one who came to me. I-I...I don't think...I don't think I-I'd have the confidence to try with anyone else..." 

>You sigh, and pull back from the hug slightly so you can look at her. 
>With a brush of your thumb, you wipe the tears from her cheeks and smile. 

"Well, I know you're a shy potato, Mischief..." 

>That manages to get a soft laugh out of the shark, a hint of a smile on her face. 

"But...you shouldn't have to TRY, I don't think." 

>"What do you mean?" She asks quietly.


"Well...I mean, I think it's better to just let things flow naturally. If someone has to go out of their way to talk to whoever their interested in...well, do you really think that'd work out in the long run?" 

>She's quiet for a moment, before coming close to you again, tucking her head under your chin. "I guess not..." 

>She nuzzles your neck before laughing sweetly. "But how would you know? Have you even had a girlfriend before?" 

>Well, if she's teasing you, then you've done your job. 

"Yeaaaah, my method is still awaiting results from testing." 

>She giggles. "Really? Never?" 

"Well...there was this one chick in highschool, but that didn't work out." 

>"What happened?" 

"Uh...she cheated." 

>"Oh...I-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring up any bad memories..." she says quietly. 

"You're fine. That was years ago, I got over it a while ago." 

>"Still..." There goes her tail again, sliding around your waist while she hugs you. "I figured you'd have been taken a while ago.." 

"What, me? I'm like on level below fedora tipping neckbeard," you laugh. "I've already accepted my impending lonely life." 

>"Oh stop," she huffs, smacking the back of your head with her fin. "Any girl would be lucky to have you." 

"What makes you say that?" 

>Is...is she blushing? 
>Maybe...though she was crying pretty hard. You can't really be sure. 

>"W-well...you're really sweet, Anon..." She says softly. 

"Speaking of sweets," you pull away from the hug to grab the candy out of the 7-11 bag, and hand it to her. "Here." 

>The shark's smile widens as she sees what kind of candy it is. "Heh...you know me so well."


>She opens the bag of candy and looks up at you. "Do you have work tomorrow?" 

"Thankfully not." 

>She smiles. "So...do you wanna just...I don't know, hang out for a while?" 

"As if I could say no," you grin. "You still have that hulu subscription or did that tank?" 

>She nods and pops one of the candies into her mouth. 
>For a moment, you get a glance at those teeth. 
>Rows of them, razor sharp. 
>Odd how she was so shy, when she could easily be so vicious if she wanted.... 

>"Yeah, I still have it." 

"Binge sci-fi then?" 

>Her smile widens and she nods happily. 
>You grab her game system controller and fire it up, soon puling up Hulu. 
>You decide to let her pick the movie. 
>It's one you've never seen, called Snowpiercer. 
>Interesting concept, at least. People stuck on a perpetually moving train during an ice age. 
>You relax back against the couch, and after a moment, Mischief scoots close to you, resting against your side, her tail in your lap. 
>Aside from the occasional comment, the two of you are mostly quiet. 
>Once she's finished the candy and tossed the wrapper aside, you feel her arms hesitantly slide somewhat around you. 
>It feels a little awkward due to the position, but you know what she wants. 
>You turn and slide your arms around the shark, allowing her to rest more comfortably in your embrace. 
>A faint blush on her cheeks, she nestles against you, and you begin to play with her hair once more. 
>Neither of you are paying attention to the movie at this point. 
>This is just...so nice. 
>It feels right. 
>And...you'd be lying if you said you didn't have some feelings for her. 

>The shark turns her head back and nuzzles into the crook of your neck for a moment before your eyes meet. 
>The faint flush on her cheeks is still there, only a little more prominent now. 
>You can feel your cheeks flush too, and your heart begins to beat a little faster.


>"A-Anon?" She says your name with a shy whisper. 
>Her cheeks flush brighter as you lean forward, closing the gap between you and give her a slow, soft kiss. 
>The kiss gets a little "eep!" out of the shark, but a second later she melts from the affection. 
>When you break it, she's panting, even trembling a little in your lap now. 
>You can't help but smile at her incredibly shy reaction. 

"Sorry. I couldn't help myself," you grin. 

>She blushes brighter, and then, with a bit of confidence you didn't expect from her, kisses you again. 
>It doesn't take long for tongue to get involved, and holy shit, those teeth make it so much more exciting. 
>When she breaks it, she giggles shyly.
>"Neither could I," she says quietly. 
>Her arms slide up your back, her pointed nails beginning to run through the hair on the back of your head. 
>As they pass over the nape of your neck and chills run through your body, she smiles a little and starts focusing on that spot. 

>"Anon...?" she starts. "Do...do you wanna spend the night?" 

>You know what that means, and it causes a rush of excitement to run through your chest. 
>You nod, and pull her in for another kiss. 
>Hormones rushing, your hands start to explore the shark's body. 
>Her hoodie comes off, as does your jacket. 
>Your fingers slip under her shirt, trailing up her back with your nails, making the shark quiver from the feeling. 
>Her skin is rough when you go up, but when you go down, it's silky smooth. 
>Your fingers begin caressing around the base of the fin on her back. 
>That's definitely a sweet spot for her, it makes the shark whimper through the deep kiss you're sharing. 
>You take advantage of that, your hands running along the sensitive appendage. 
>Off comes your shirt too, and as she breaks the kiss, her head suddenly turns down and she began to lightly nibble on the skin of your neck. 
>She kept it just light enough to not make you bleed. 
>And damn, did it get you solid.


>After a minute or two more of kisses, bites, and caresses, off comes her shirt. 
>She's...hesitant, to remove her bra, her cheeks alight with blush. 
>Why, you didn't understand. Her breasts were nothing short of perfect. 
>Though on the smaller side, they were perky, and enough to grab a handful. In your eyes, perfect. 
>Your teasing caresses are enough to get a soft moan out of her, but when you slip one of her nipples into your mouth, they become a little louder. 
>Her hands press your head against her breast, her breath shaky. "O-oh, Anon..." 

>Your erection is borderline painful at this point.
>She clearly felt it, her hips beginning to lightly grind against the bulge in your crotch. 
>Diamonds.mov 
>Your right hand slowly trails down her belly now, slipping under the waistline of her panties and two of your fingers between her legs.
>The sensation of your fingers running over her soaked slit elicits a gasp from Mischief, 
>She whines your name again, grinding her hips against your fingers. 
>As you pull your fingers back, she whimpers until she sees you beginning to unbuckle your belt. 

>Your pants come off, as do hers, and soon you're both completely naked. 
>You relocate to her bedroom, it'd be easier that way.
>Soon enough, you're on top of her in bed, kissing her softly once more, your raging boner hard as a rock against her soft stomach.
>She's already warmed up, so it looks like foreplay wasn't much of an issue. 
>You pull the shark in for a deep kiss, then ask quietly. 

"Have you ever...done it like this before?" 

>Her soft palm runs over your erection, and she shakes her head shyly. "N-not really, no..."

"Then just relax for me baby, okay? And if it's too uncomfortable and you want me to stop, tell me." 

>"O-okay..."


>Lining yourself up with her entrance, you slowly push yourself inside her. 
>Almost immediately, the shark's body tenses, and you stop about a quarter of the way in, giving her a sweet kiss. 

"I'm not hurting you am I?" 

>"N-no...keep going," she whispers, pulling your head down for another kiss. 
>You return it, and keep going. 
>You do have to take it slow, but eventually, she's adjusted to you, and you can start to speed it up. 
>You don't jackhammer it, though. 
>No, you work a nice, steady, even pace, going deep each time. 
>It seems to be perfect for her, you're hitting sensitive spots inside her certainly wasn't used to being stimulated. 
>As you thrust, you continue to kiss her until she's so wound up she's panting hard. 
>At that point, she just holds your head against her chest while you thrust into her. 

>"A-Anon..." she breathes while you start pressing balls deep with each thrust. "I-I'm getting close..." 

>You start to go a little faster while maintaining the depth of your thrusts. 
>Your own climax is building, a hot pressure at the base of your cock. 
>The speed is enough to help push her along, though. 
>Her nails dig into your back as her body tenses up, her walls clamping down around you, spasaming as her climax hits. "O-oh, A-Anon!" 
>The contractions and sudden increased tightness is enough to send you over the brink as well, your load spraying deep in her. 
>Thank god for the genetic gap. 

>The both of you panting hard, you wait for your mind to come off the orgasmic high before plopping down beside her. 
>The shark curls up close to you, nuzzling your chest. 
>"Anon...that was...a-amazing..." She whispers. 
>You grin, and tilt her chin up, giving her a soft kiss. 

"Glad to hear it..." you say with a little grin. "Hope I cheered you up." 

>She giggles, nuzzling your chest before letting out a tiny yawn. "I'd say you did..." 

>Her hand finds yours as she cuddles up to you. 

>"Goodnight, Anon."
