Chapter 1: Buff Bear
>"Come on Anon, only five more, you can do it, five more, push it"
>Only five more, thats what she already said ten times ago
>You try in vain to push the heavy weights of you chest one mor time and fail
>Only two seconds of your struggle later the barbell is lifted from you
>Eirin is looking down on you, almost effortlessly holding the pole in one hand
>"Not bad, you nearly got 20 this time. Tomorrow we will ad some more weight"
>You lay on the bench in the fitness studio and try to keep breathing, as your chest and arm muscles burn
>Eirin has already cleaned up, placed the weight back on the rack and is doing push ups
>You always thought bears were supposed to be lazy, fat and soft
>Eirin has destroyed that prejudice
>You met her when you tried to lift a crate of water up the stairs when the elevator was broken
>While you struggled with your load she simply grabbed the crate and carried it with one hand
>You were suprised and agreed to let her coach your new fitness training
>That was a mistake, she is a powerhouse, completely inexhaustible
>There has been a time where you never saw a fitness studio from the inside
>Now you spend 2 hours in it every day, 6 days a week
>Your baby fat has molten away and muscles are starting to form but it will still take some time
>Eirin meanwhile is sporting a sixpack that is clearly visible, even through her fur
>Her biceps is neraly a big as your head and her legs turn the pedals of the exercise bike for nearly an hour against resistance 10
>You can't even move them at this level
>Eirin has finished her 20 ppush ups and grabs your arm
>"Come on Anon, lets go to the rowing machine next, this time we will only do 5 kilometers"
>Help!

2 hours later

>You are so tired that Eirin has to nearly carry you back to your apartment
>Once you are back you simply fall into your bed
>Tomorrow is a new day and Eirin is going to drag you back
>For some reason she is still enduring you with the patience of an angel
>Now you need sleep and you already know that you are going to regret it
>The muscle ache are terrible but the protein shakes are worse
>They always taste like someone poured flour into stale water and filterd it with an old sock
>With your last thought being about socks you drift off to sleep
End of Chapter 1

Chapter 2: Get /fit
>AHHHHHHHH
>Every single muscle in your body is burning
>It feels like satan himself is using you as a personal sauna
>There is no way you can continue like this
>You drag yourself into the shower and turn on the water
>While you enjoy the massage from the water there is a single thought in your mind
>There has to be a better way to train, a way that will not destroy you
>A simple way would be to simply tell Eirin that you have to stop, but that would not only be rude but also wrong
>You really have to train you body, to much junkfood and not enough sport have paid their toll on you 
>You sit down in front of your computer (Oh god, bending your knees was a mistake) and open Google
>Soon you find an image board with lots of fitness tips
>You never heard of "Pawchan" before but the /fit board sounds awesome

2 months later

>"Wow, Anon. You really made a lot of progress with your abdominals"
>Eirin is similing down on you while you finish your last repetition
>"Thanks, I found some really good guidance on the internet"
>Eirin is raising her eyebrow
>"Really ? Nice one. So, what did you change ?"
>"Actually pretty simple. I simply stopped masturbating"
>Eirin is nearly choking on her water
>"What ?"
>You send her a smirk
>"Just kidding, I stopped eating fast food and started a protein diet"
>Eirin is still coughing while you put the first weight on the barbell

3 months later

>Winter is aproching fast and you spend more and more time in the gym
>You even paid for the sauna
>For some reason Eirin has stopped her daily training, only appearing once or twice a week
>She also changed her normally very tight shirt for a loose sweater
>As you come home one friday you haven't seen her the whole week 
>You decide to knock on her door, maybe she is ill
>She helped you, now you can help her
>You wipe the snow from your coat and walk up the stairs to her door
>As you knock you can hear a mixture of sounds behind it
>Suddenly the door is ripped open and you are nearly smothered by an insane amount of brown fur
>An incredibla fat male bear is standing in front of you and you have no idea how he even got through the staircase
>"Hey...is Eirin here ?"
>He is turning his head around and shouts back into the flat
>"Sis, theres a human here for you"
>Nice
>For a moment you can peek past his belly and see two other bears sitting around the table
>Both are nearly as fat as the one in front of you
>Eirin is walking in from the kitchen, carrying a tablet full of food and is staring at you
>She is wearing a simple jogging suit and you can see her belly rolls
>It looks like she gained nearly 30 kilos
>For a moment you are speechless before the realisation hits you like a freight train
>You completely forgot about hibernation
End of Chapter 2

Chaper 3 of Buff Bear: Sleep
>"So...one month ?
>Eirin is nodding slowly, her fat rolls jiggling with the movement
>"Yes, even though there are medicaments against it and enough food, we still have to sleep"
>You are both standing on the balcony of her flat, watching the sunset
>Eirin is slowly sipping on a cup of warm milk while you are searching for words
>"I heared about the hibernation but i never thought that you would do it"
>"Oh, me not ? Why ?"
>You feel like you walked into a trap here
>"Well..because you are all buff and strong and not... you know"
>"Fat ?"
>Thats not what you wanted to say but now...
>"Yes...?"
>Eirin is looking away from you and puts down her cup before she reaches into her mouth
>She is rummaging around in it a while before she pulls it out again
>You can see the false teeth in her hand as she showes them to you
>"What ..?"
>"I lost them when I was 16, shortly after the hibernation"
>You have to shwallow hard before you can respond
>"What happened ?"
>For a moment there is silence before Eirin starts talking, tears are starting to form in her eyes
>You can hear it in her voice
>"My grandmother died during hibernation, cardiac arrest because of steatosis. My Grandfather found her when he woke up but she was already dead for a week"
>You simply listen
>"For weeks after it I was terrified, I ate nearly one kilo of honey per day to deal with the sadness"
>"After some time my teeth started to hurt and i gained nearly 30 kilos"
>You place your hand on her back as she starts to cry harder"
>"I lost nearly my entire top row of my teeth"
>You speak up to calm her down
>"Hey, thats not bad. I never really noticed and..."
>Eirin is interrupting you
>"I don't care about the teeth. But you know what the worst thing was ?"
>You shake your head
>"Nobody was suprised. Everyone just accepted it, even my gluttony. Because thats what bears are supposed to do, eat, sleep and die during sleep after eating to much"
>She is crying hard now, forcing her words out between sobs
>"I didn't want to end like this, so I started to train hard after I lost my teeth. I can lose this extra fat in nearly 2 months after the hibernation now"
>Her sobs stop and she goes quiet for a while
>"But I am still scared. And I can't change it. I have to sleep"
>You feel bad for her, really bad
>"Hey Eirin, you know...I don't have to sleep all the time. I cant take care of you"
>For a moment she is silent again, before a literal bear hug engulfs you

2 weeks later

>You walk back into Eirins living room and sit down on the sofa, next to the slowly breathing mountain of brown fluff
>Eirin has been sleeping for nearly one week now
>You never left her side
>You even got your boss to approve your plan for telework on your computer
>Leaning back into the sofa there is a deep silence in the room
>Well, three more weeks of peace before she is dragging you back to the studio
>You can't wait
