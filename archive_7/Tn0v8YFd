IT'S YOUR MOVE

>Be Anon
>You've been putting up with your human girlfriend's shit for just over a year now.
>At first she had been a pretty fun person, but now it almost seemed like she was "bored" of you.
>It made you a bit upset, but more than anything, it made you mad.
>She didn't even treat you like a person anymore.
>She used you for free food, spending money, and car rides.
>The worst part of it all? She didn't even put out anymore.
>Her excuse was full of shit too, just like the rest of her. She said that she didn't want to because "she might get pregnant".
>What bullshit. She was on more birth control than any women you had ever known. She had sex like a fish drank water.
>Your best friend in the whole world, An Anthro Badger, had been practically BEGGING you to leave your Girlfriend for the longest time now.
>It was probably in your best interests to do so, but still. You were almost afraid of breaking up with her.
>When she got angry, your Girlfriend could be a bit... Well, psychotic would be a good way to describe it.
>You'll never forget the time she threatened to taser you because you refused to give her and her friends a ride to the mall.
>You have no clue why you put up with her. Maybe because she had been with you for a long time, and you didn't want to end it. It was the longest relationship you'd ever been in.

>Currently, it was 6 O'clock at night. You were laying in your bed, trying to calm down.
>You had just wrapped up a huge argument with your Girlfriend.
>She said she was going to treat you to dinner tonight, to make up for her actions lately.
>You had been hopeful that you would reach an understanding between the two of you, but of course, she had found a way to fuck it up.
>She had cancelled at the last second, saying she was going to hang out with friends instead, and that you shouldn't "expect her to take care of you".
>That had made you mad, but the straw that broke the camels back was when she asked you for a ride and some spending money.
>You told her that she would have to pay you for the gas. Her "friends" lived a half-hour away, and you didn't want to waste the gas money. You needed your car to get to work.
>In a nutshell, she had told you to go fuck yourself, saying that you had way more than enough spending money.
>You told her that you barely had enough to pay for rent, let alone pay for her half-drunk escapades.
>In response, she had screamed at you, telling you that you could either give her money for an Uber, or you could kiss her ass goodbye.
>She had done this before, and you had always relented.
>This time though, you were seeing red.
>You told her to get the fuck out of your house or you were going to call the cops. It was one of the few powers you held over her. She had been in trouble with the law before, and the police were always "happy to accommodate" her. You've had to bail her out more than once.
>It resulted in nearly a half-hour of mutual screaming. You're surprised nobody called the cops.
>She called you a dirty motherfucker, and kicked over your favorite potted plant before loudly storming out of the house, slamming the door as hard as she could, the window shaking in its frame.
>You can hear her yelling obscenities at you as she calls her friends, asking for a ride from them instead.
>The whole time she waited for her friends, she would yell at you from outside, occasionally coming up to the door and banging on it.
>Good thing you locked the door.
>Eventually, her friends had arrived to take her away.
>As one last "fuck you", she had thrown an empty bottle from out of her friends car and into the driveway, glass shattering all over the concrete pavement.

>You sat there in your bed, contemplating your next move while wondering if you still had a girlfriend.
>You sigh, deciding to call your friend for advice. She was an Anthro Badger named Sue. You had known each other since Middle School, and you had been thick as thieves ever since.
>You dial her number, before hitting the call button. The phone rings three times before she picks up.
>"Hey, Anon. What's going on?"
>You groan out a greeting, telling her that you needed some advice.
>There's a short pause before she responds.
>"Anon? Are you okay? You don't sound so good."
>You sigh, telling her that you had just been in a big fight with your Girlfriend.
>Sue responds almost immediately, a panicked, angry tone in her voice.
>"What!? What did that BITCH do this time!? Do you need any help? Did she hurt you!?"
>Sue never called your Girlfriend by her name. She preferred calling her either "That Bitch" or "That Fucking Cunt". You didn't bother correcting her anymore.
>You try to calm her down a bit, saying that the only thing she managed to hurt was a fern in your living room.
>"Goddamn it. What happened?"
>You tell her the full story, from when she cancelled your dinner date, to when she shattered a bottle in your driveway and sped off.
>"What the fuck is wrong with her? Listen, I'm going to come and pick you up. If that whore doesn't want to treat you like you matter, then -I- will. I'll be there in five minutes."
>You try to tell her that she can stay home and that you'll be fine, but you're cut off as she hangs up.
>Well, damn.
>Atleast things could be worse.
>You groan, getting off of your bed.
>You might as well prepare to leave.
>You throw on some more simple clothing, a pair of sweats and a t-shirt.
>You go back out to your living room, and survey the damage.
>She had knocked some things over, but nothing was permanently damaged.
>You clean up as best as you can, before you can hear a car horn honk outside.
>Looking out of the window, you can see that it's Sue. She's parked on the curb by your driveway.
>You leave, locking the door behind you.
>You walk to her car, being careful to step around the shards of glass laying in the driveway. You would have to clean that up when you got back. No way in Hell your piece of shit Girlfriend was.
>You slide into the passenger seat with a sigh, and Sue pats you on the leg thoughtfully.
>"Don't worry, Anon. I'll cheer you up. I'll take you back to my place and make you a nice dinner. Then, I don't know, we can watch a movie or something."
>You wordlessly nod, and Sue gives you a sympathetic smile.
>Sue was an Anthro Badger, the same age as you. She stood at 5'11", a few inches shorter than you.
>The two of you had known each other since you were kids, and you had always gotten along perfectly. Even though everyone had always told the two of you that you made the perfect pair, you had never made things official between the two of you.
>She had never made a move on you, and you had never made a move on her.
>Sue turns her attention to the road and eases down on the accelerator, sending the two of you off in the direction of her apartment.

>The car ride isn't long. Sue barely lives a mile away, in a small apartment block.
>She pulls into her usual spot, and the two of you hop out of the car.
>She leads you through the apartment doors, and up the stairs to her apartment.
>She opens the door, and you enter her small living room.
>Sue lived a very modest life, and her apartment decor reflected it perfectly. The place felt very cozy, and you could smell a scented candle burning.
>Even though she lived alone, she kept her place almost immaculate.
>She eases you down onto the couch, and sits next to you with a smile.
>"So, what do you want me to make you? Any ideas?"
>You shrug, telling her to surprise you.
>She gives you a small frown, and gently squeezes your arm.
>"Okay, Anon. I'll cook you something good. Just relax, and try to forget about that... That BITCH."
>She hands you the TV remote and gives you a small hug, before getting up to head into the kitchen.
>You can hear her cabinets creaking and pots banging around. Sue may be a bit clumsy, but she had always been a DAMN fine cook.
>You settle into the couch. You might as well relax a bit while you wait for her to start dinner.
>You flip on the TV, and turn on some generic game show. You didn't watch much TV.
>You get up and try to head into the kitchen to see if Sue needs any help cooking.
>You're met by her waving a saucepan at you.
>"No! You go sit back down and relax! I'll take care of everything for you."
>Nodding, you go back to sit down on the couch.
>Sue calls out to you from the kitchen.
>"Okay, I know what I'm going to make you. Don't come in the kitchen and ruin the surprise, or I'll claw your eyes out."
>You shuddered at the thought. Badgers had some pretty wicked claws, and Sue was no exception.
>"It won't be long, Anon! You just watch TV. Maybe pick out a movie while you're sitting there. You know where my DVDs are in my room."
>You tell her you'll take a look in a minute. For now you just wanted to clear your head with some mindless TV.
>"Whatever floats your boat, Anon."

>After a few minutes, you decide to go check out Sue's movie stash.
>She kept a sizable amount of them in her room, right next to her computer.
>You didn't go in her room much, but you're pretty sure you could find them.
>You open the door to her room, and flick on the light.
>It's a bit messy in here compared to the rest of her apartment. There's some clothes thrown on the ground (including her panties), and it smells kind of... Musky. Weird.
>Next to the unmade bed there's a small bookcase filled with DVDs, and her computer desk.
>Crouching down so you can better see the DVDs, you eye through her collection.
>Man, she has everything here...
>You finger your way through one row, trying to pick out something good.
>Let's see... She has Slaughter-Sphere 1 and 2, some weird detective movie, a horror flick you remember seeing as a kid, and "Badger Beauties get BRED".
>Wait, what?
>You pull that last DVD case out of the bookshelf, inspecting it.
>What the fuck, Sue?
>Reading the summary on the back, you can see that it's a porno. "Featuring a cast of young badger hotties getting every hole filled by thick Human DICK!"
>Looking back at her bookcase, you can see that the whole collection has Porn CDs mixed in with the normal movies. Most of them feature badgers, or other Anthros. They all feature Humans in one way or another.
>Who the fuck leaves their porn movies sitting out with their normal ones?!
>Goddamn it. You push the movie back where you found it, and instead grab Slaughter-Sphere 2. A true modern classic.
>You stand back up and turn to leave the room, when you notice her computer screen is on.
>From where you're standing, all you can see is pink boxes of text on a yellow background.
>Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you take a closer look.
>Oh, this must be that one site called 4chan. You've heard of it before. Don't they blow up yellow vans or something?
>Looking closer at the text, they appear to be talking about Anthros. Specifically, an Anthro is asking for advice about handling her heat around her Human friend.
>Oh hey, there's an image here too. It's a bit too small to make out what's happening, though. You click on it, enlarging it.
>What the FUCK.
>It's not an image, it's a video. A video of an Anthro Great Dane getting pounded by a Human, her slender legs wrapped around his midsection.
>Thank GOD she has headphones plugged into the computer. Having to listen to some Anthro Canine moaning is the last thing you want to do right now.
>Goddamn, is THIS what Sue's into? Human on Anthro porn?
>You aren't sure how to feel about that.
>"Anon! You done in there yet, or did you fall asleep or something!?"
>Shit!
>You stammer out that you're still looking for a good movie.
>Smooth one.
>"Need some help? I have some suggestions if you want."
>Shit, shit, shit!
>You yell out that you're fine, just trying to decide between a few.
>You minimize the video, and scroll back down to where the page was at before you started reading it.
>Grabbing the movie, you head back out in the living room, plopping down onto the couch with a red face.
>Sue calls out from the kitchen once more:
>"Did you, uh, like my movie collection Anon?"
>You tell her it's pretty good.
>With an almost disappointed tone, she replies.
>"What did you decide on?"
>You tell her you grabbed her copy of Slaughter-Sphere 2.
>"Good choice. I got a friend that really likes that."
>"Anyways, dinner will be ready soon. I'll tell you when."
>"Until then, just... I don't know. Do whatever. Make yourself at home, Anon."

>As you watch the game show, you suddenly feel your phone buzz.
>Hm.
>You pull out your phone, seeing the text.
>Oh boy, It's from your Girlfriend.
>"will b out untill tommrow mrning"
>"make srue u unlock th edoor. i left my keys at ur plaec"
>"got fcked up with freinds lol"
>Accompanying the texts, is a picture.
>It's your Girlfriend, one of her friends... And like three dudes.
>What the fuck!
>You knew one of her friends was a guy, but this was pushing it.
>You text her back, asking her where she was staying.
>Within a couple minutes, you get a response.
>"chads :) hes a cool guy. he lets me slep inhis bed"
>That's it. You didn't care if she was sleeping off her hangover in some shitty motel room like usual, but spending the night with some retard metro-sexual was beyond your limit.
>You text her back, saying that she shouldn't bother coming back to your house.
>It's not like she kept any of her stuff there, other than some cheap makeup.
>Thank God you weren't stupid enough to let her move in with you.
>"wtf anon dont b a dick"
>"what did i do???"
>You furiously text her back, saying that you were tired of her bullshit.
>"whtever, chad has a biger dick anyway"
>You block her number and erase the contact, fuming. When you got back home, you were going to toss all the shit she had at your house right into the trash.
>You shove your phone back into your pocket, and look up. Right into Sue's worried face.
>"Anon? Are you okay? You don't look too well..."
>You don't answer, your throat tightening.
>She sits next to your, wrapping an arm around you as she leaned into you.
>"It's okay, tell me what's going on."
>You groan, pressing a hand against your face.
>You tell her that you just broke up with your girlfriend, and that you're pretty certain that she had been cheating on you.
>Without a word, Sues' clawed hands reach out and clutch your head, bringing it to rest in the fluff around her neck.
>Her fur had a pleasant scent to it, a smell you had come to associate with Sue.
>You can feel tears starting to form in your eyes, so you elect to dry them in Sue's warm fur.
>She pats your back as you lift your head out of her fur.
>"Well, look on the bright side Anon."
>"At least she's out of your life now. You won't have to deal with her shit again."
>She stands up, holding your arm.
>"Now come on. Dinner's ready. I made spaghetti."

>She eases you over to the table, pulling out your chair for you.
>"Sit. I'll plate your food. Sorry if you wanted something to drink. All I have is water."
>You tell her that water is fine, and she smiles at you.
>"Okay, Anon."
>After a few minutes, everything is ready. She sits across from you at the table, a plate of spaghetti in front of the two of you.
>It smells pretty good... And you don't think that this sauce is from a jar or can.
>You ask, and she answers with a grin.
>"Thanks, Anon! I made some sauce earlier in the week, but I made too much. I froze some, and that's what you're eating."
>You lift some up on a fork, and taste it.
>Tastes good!
>The two of you begin to eat your meal, making small talk.
>You talked about a variety of subjects, Sue obviously trying to keep your mind off of your (extremely) recent breakup. You appreciated the effort she was making.
>Sue had always known what to say to make you feel better.
>You're still trying to get the mental images of Sue watching Human on Anthro porn out of your mind, and this spaghetti is doing a pretty fine job of helping you along.
>Sadly though, eventually the two of you polish off the last of the spaghetti.
>A pity. It was some of the tastiest pasta you've ever had.
>You get up and place the dish in the sink, running water over it to loosen any sauce.
>Sue stops you though, pulling you away from the sink with her clawed hands.
>"No, no! You go sit over there and relax. Let me wash the dishes. It'll only take a couple minutes."
>You insist on helping, causing Sue to let out an irritated sigh.
>"Fine. Just, um, rinse off the plates and then put them in the dishwasher."
>You do as she asks, and she turns on the dishwasher when you're done.
>"Now let's go watch that movie. I never get tired of Slaughter-Sphere."

>It's been an hour since Sue put Slaughter-Sphere 2 on. It was nearing the conclusion, but you weren't really paying attention.
>To be honest, you were pretty tired. The meal was filling, and you felt a bit sluggish.
>That and you didn't like Slaughter-Sphere too much. You would never tell Sue that, though. Not unless you wanted her to bite your face off. She got REALLY aggressive when it came to discussing films.
>Strangely though, Sue didn't seem all that into the movie either.
>She had been leaning up against you for the whole movie, her fuzzy head nestled up next to your shoulder.
>Every once in awhile, she would either rub her head against you or press her arm against you.
>You close your eyes, soaking in the sensation of her soft fur rubbing against you.
>Before you can drift off though, you're quickly awakened by the sensation of her gently shaking your shoulder.
>"Come on, Anon. You can't just sleep on my couch."
>You mumble out an apology, saying that you were just tired.
>You try to stand up, saying you would try and catch a taxi home.
>You're quickly grabbed and pulled back down onto the couch.
>"No! I meant that you couldn't sleep like... This. You can spend the night, it's no problem."
>"Now take your shoes off. And your jacket. Get comfortable, you know? I'll go get you a blanket and pillow."
>You yawn, looking at your phone.
>Yikes, it was way later than you thought it was.
>Well, you might as well stay the night. You could deal with the bullshit back home in the morning. Hopefully you didn't return to find your car tires slashed and the windows busted in. Your Ex-Girlfriend seemed psycho enough to pull something like that.
>Shaking your head to dispel the thought, you take off your sneakers, socks, and jacket.
>Right on time, Sue walks out with a soft looking pillow and an even softer looking fleece blanket.
>She sets them down on the couch next to you with a smile.
>"If you need anything else, I'll be in my bedroom. You can leave the TV on, just don't leave it up too loud. I don't want any of my neighbors to start pounding on my door."
>She picks up your jacket, folding it over her arm.
>"I'll, um, go hang this up..."
>You nod, and she walks into her room, the door shutting.
>Apparently she's going to hang it up in her room. Whatever.
>Well, she asked you to get comfy, so you better get comfy.
>You take your shirt off, but leave your sweatpants on.
>You put the pillow next to one of the couches armrests, and lay down, pulling the fuzzy blanket over your body.
>It was soft, warm, and smelled faintly like Sue.
>Absolutely comfy.

>After maybe 30 minutes, you decide that another blanket couldn't hurt.
>It was a bit chilly in here, especially now that it was dark out. Sue likely kept it that way because she was covered head to toe in thick fur. Her definition of "room temperature" was a lot lower than yours.
>You sit up, pushing the thin blanket off of you. It was soft, but didn't exactly trap much heat. Sue probably had another one you could use.
>You walk over to her door. You can hear some noise inside.
>Good, she's still awake. Probably watching something on her phone.
>You knock gently, opening the door.
>BIG MISTAKE.
>Staring at you with wide eyes, Sue is sitting naked on her bed, a couple fingers knuckle deep in her cunt, while her other hand is pressing your jacket to her nose.
>SHIT.
>The two of you stand there frozen, afraid to make the first move.
>To your surprise, Sue is the first to take action. Not in the way you would expect, though.
>Instead of stopping, she slowly resumes rubbing herself, still staring at you with wide eyes.
>What the FUCK.
>You don't move. You can't help but watch what's happening.
>Your best friend is rubbing one out to the smell of your jacket.
>What fresh hell is this?
>You take a single step back, causing Sue to yell out.
>"W-Wait! Anon!"
>"I, um... This is... I'm just..."
>She deadpans.
>"Okay, this is EXACTLY what it looks like. I won't lie."
>"I'm sorry! It's just that you smell SO damn good, Anon! I couldn't help it!"
>"You must think I'm so weird... Oh God, I'm sorry..."
>You mention to her that she has not stopped pleasuring herself.
>She looks at you uneasily, not slowing down in the slightest.
>"Ummm... Yes."
>You ask her if she's going to stop.
>She doesn't hesitate, immediately answering.
>"No."
>You can feel a tent starting to rise in your underwear.
>Your sweatpants don't help the situation, clearing showing off your length.
>Sue is practically drooling as she eyes your bulge.
>Things were moving faster than a speeding bullet, but for some reason it didn't concern you too much. 
>Sue looks at you with a hopeful look.
>"Anon... Please... Please fuck me! I want... I NEED you!"
>She wiggles around a bit in an attempt to show off her body. She may be a bit shorter than you, but she was pretty toned.
>"Come on, Anon... Haven't you ever wondered what warm fur would feel like against your whole body? I can show you~."
>Shit, why does that make you hard!?
>Sue is clearly interested in what she sees.
>"Please, Anon... I'll be gentle. I won't use my claws... Unless you WANT me to~."
>Oh, SHIT. You didn't know it was possible for your boner to reach these levels. Well, it looks like your body made the choicr for you.
>You answer her by dropping your drawers.

>Sue moves faster than you've ever seen her move before, jumping out of bed and rushing over to you.
>She pulls you over to the bed.
>"Lay on your back. Please."
>You comply, laying your head on her pillow.
>You jump a bit when you can feel her nose press against your balls.
>She puts her hands on your legs to still them, and begins to sniff and drool all over your cock and balls.
>"Oh God, oh fuck... I've wanted this for so long..."
>You have to swallow back a yelp when you feel her suddenly kiss the tip of your cock, her tongue circling around the head.
>"Get ready, Anon... Once we start, I'm not gonna stop for ANYTHING."
>You try and form a response, but are quickly cut off as your length disappears into her hot, slimy mouth.
>Your hands grip the sheets as she gently works her tongue around your shaft.
>The pleasure you're getting from this is so intense that it almost feels like your eyes are about to pop out of their sockets.
>Her head begins to slowly bob up and down, her head bottoming out against your hips each time she comes down.
>You choke out a plea for her to slow down, but she just looks at you with half-lidded eyes, increasing her tempo ever so slightly.
>She's being very careful to be gentle, but every once in awhile you can feel her sharp teeth bump against your dick. For some reason it only serves to increase your lust for her.
>You put your hand on her head, telling her that you're starting to get close.
>She smiles around your dick and bobs her head up and down even faster.
>Oh. SHIT.
>Your head flies back into the pillow as you release into her mouth, your sperm shooting straight down her throat.
>She drinks it all up, and then licks your cock clean, being sure she doesn't waste a single drop.
>She gives you an almost drunken smile, and clambers up on top of you, straddling your legs.
>She had always been shorter than you, but in this moment she could have been 10 feet tall.

>She leans forward, wrapping her arms around you tightly.
>Her slit was pressed up against your half-flaccid cock, and she lazily ground her hips against yours in an effort to get you ready for round two.
>She leans forward, whispering in your ear salaciously:
>"I hope you're ready, Anon~. We badgers can be a bit... Greedy in the bedroom."
>When you finally get hard enough again, Sue grins at you, reaching down to align your dick with her cunt.
>As she slowly slides down your pole, the two of you share a moan of pleasure.
>"Ah! A-Anon!"
>Her claws prick your shoulders as she eases herself down onto you agonizingly slowly.
>When your hips finally meet, she lets out a loud exhale, panting.
>She doesn't stop for long though.
>After a moment, she begins to lift up off of you until only your tip is still inside her.
>Then she quickly drops down, her furry ass slamming against your hips.
>She rides you hard, not stopping for anything.
>All you can do is keep you hands on her hips, your fingers gripping her short fur.
>You can't take much more of this... And based on the noises Sue is making, neither can she.
>She lets out a series of feral growls, slamming down onto you as hard as she can.
>You're probably going to be bruised in the morning, but you have other things on your mind right now.
>Sue slams down on you one final time, letting out a feral cry as her claws dig into your shoulders.
>Her intense orgasm is enough to send you over the edge, her inner walls strangling your cock.
>You release deep inside of her, painting her womb white with your seed.
>She roughly grinds against you, riding out her orgasm while she pants heavily.
>She pulls you in for a kiss, her tongue diving inside of your mouth.
>The two of you seperate, a strand of saliva linking your lips.
>Sue leans in close to you, whispering in your ear.
>"Don't think we're done here, Anon... We badgers can go All. Night. Long."
>"Now flip me over, you're on top this time. Don't be afraid to get a little rough~."

>The next morning, you wake up in a tangled pile of moist sheets and blankets.
>Sue is still fast asleep, snuggled up in your arms.
>There's a wide grin on her face, and her leg is twitching a bit as she slumbers.
>You gently pet her muzzle, earning a satisfied huff from her.
>Your pelvis felt like it had been repeatedly hit by large hammers, but it was worth it. You've never cum so hard (or so many times) in your life as you did last night.
>Sue stirred a bit in your grasp, her warm fur rubbing against your bare chest.
>If you had known she was into Humans, you probably would have done this a lot sooner.
>Shit, when she told you to pick a movie from her room, was her plan to have you find her human porn?
>Whatever, it didn't matter now.
>You hold her close, laying back down.
>You think you would stay in bed for a bit longer.
>Yeah, that sounds like a good idea.

END
