>It’s a little after three in the morning
>The night of Halloween
>Your place was the last stop on the gauntlet of party-hopping debauchery
>Luckily, half the crew you started out with had ditched the group as the night progressed
>Meaning you had your night of fun and didn’t have to clean up too much afterwards
>Everyone who came to your place was able to leave; nobody to crash at your place overnight
>In fact, some of them were pretty sober by the end of it
>Including a girl in a typical “sexy devil” costume who wouldn’t take her eyes off you
>Your friends elbowed you in the ribs and tried to get you to hook up with her
>But the moment you decided to make a move she had already left
>Bummer
>So it’s another lonely night for Anon once the last guest left
>You can barely sleep after all that, and after a night of drinking you’re feeling alcohol-induced peckishness
>You could hold out until morning, or grab a quick snack
>Hunger wins out, so you hop out of bed almost immediately after getting into it and head over to your refrigerator to scavenge what you can
>Seems like someone already beat you to it
>The door is open and a dark shape is rooting around inside
>You see something glistening in the shadows, and moaning coming from where the light radiates
>You throw the lights on, but the darkness standing before the fridge remains
>It’s a voluptuous female shape, but with the legs, arms, and head of a black-furred canine
>She’s already unlike any dog you’ve ever seen just by being two-legged, but the sharp horns, bat wings, crimson eyes, and spaded tail also make her unlike any two-legged dog you could have ever imagined
>Completely nude; the glistening you saw was her slick, aroused, rosy lips squeezed between a heavy rump
>She turns to look at you with a thick roll of salami punctured between her teeth
>She grins around the meat and snaps it in half, hanging on to the two parts with a long, curling, forked tongue so that she can swallow them whole one at a time
>You watch the chunks travel down her throat in huge bulges
>”Looks like we both had the same idea,” she says with a sultry tone. “A little bite in the witching hour.”
>Just then it hits you
>This was the girl from the parties
>Or, at least she has the same devilish accessories as her
>But this is some kind of unbelievable canine-devil hybrid
>Like a succubus mixed with a hellhound
>As she struts over to you on the tips of her paw pads you are smacked with her aroma
>It’s not perfume, but lust and pure pheromones
>And yet there is also a seed of dread inside you
>”You must know how I’ve been watching you all night, Anon.”
>She reaches up and runs her black nails across your cheek
>Hell is not fire and brimstone, but a chilling temptation like the one running down your spine
>”Not every man is lucky to be my prey. You haven’t been very lucky in your love life, but it’s all going to change before the sun rises.”
>Her muzzle pulls back into a wicked smile
>You need to run, the voice in your head says
>But where? You’re already in the safest place you can think of, and it’s not like you can come back with this hellhound still hanging around
>Although, she DID mention the sun
>Maybe you just have to stall her until morning?
>You say a quick goodbye and run to your door
>When you open it up, you wish you hadn’t
>The maw of some cosmic horror is on the other side, teeth lining its throat like a hideous blender
>You hear the muffled screams of victims deep within its gullet, and it doesn’t intend on passing up yet another meal
>A thin rope wraps around your waist and pulls you back into the room
>It’s not just a rope; it’s the hellhound’s whippy tail
>And you’re no longer back home, but in a succubus’ lair
>Red and black satin everywhere
>Bondage gear adorning the walls like ornaments or art
>Bottles and wine glasses filled with something you know isn’t wine
>You’re on the floor with the hellhound looming over you
>A fleck of her feminine juices drips down onto your forehead
>It burns hotter than any boiling water could
>But you can’t scream
>Her tail had worked its way up to your head and gagged your mouth as you lay on the needle-like carpet
>”You are a bad, bad boy, Anon,” she scolds. “Running away from a lady? You should stop and get to know me. After all, we’re going to be together for an eternity.”
>You’re pulled to your feet by your neck, and then the tail becomes lax
>Only to reposition itself back to your waist
>With your arms pinned to your sides
>”I was going to give you unsurpassable pleasure, the typical “mortal” way…”
>Her front paws, her “hands”, rest on your shoulders
>”But now I see you’ll need something with a little more discipline involved.”
>Her once petite bat wings grow into a massive pair
>They curl around your ensnared form like a cage
>”Now then. When was the last time you had your blood drawn?”
>Every beat of your heart lets her tail tighten its constriction
>It’s like a tourniquet for your whole body
>The blood rushes to your head, and sweat pours out of your skin to cool the sudden heat
>”You know what they say: it’s the initial prick that hurts the most.”
>Her muzzle opens to reveal two long, thin fangs
>You barely have enough time to let out a gasp before she clamps her mouth around the base of your neck
>The sensation is deep, but it’s not enough to send you into shock
>In fact, the longer she holds the position the duller the pain gets
>She gives a powerful suck
>It feels as though your very soul is draining into her
>But with the quick pause for air she injects a new feeling into you
>It’s pure adrenaline mixed with an aphrodisiac
>Every inhale pumps a little more blood into your shaft, until you’re painfully erect
>Every surge feels as though you’re completely drained of your blood, then filled back up with her exhale
>And every draw seems to pull a little more of your essence with it
>You’re close to blacking out whenever she draws you into her throat, and when she pauses for even the shortest time you’re dragged back to her feverish reality
>The only thing stable is your throbbing length, which is so cripplingly sensitive you’re afraid to regain any sensation in your body
>While the fluids syphoned out of you flow quickly, something thicker slowly creeps forward from your groin
>Your gasping becomes a countdown for the climax, each one getting higher and higher
>Her tail unravels around you, and it’s like taking the knot out of a garden hose
>Until the rush is stopped by a valve
>Your release is denied by a single finger of the hellhound’s paw
>Whatever fiendish trick she’s using, it’s more than effective
>You’re grunting and whining, holding in the deluge as she chuckles at you mockingly
>Even the jack-o-lanterns sneer at you with fiery eyes
>She’s saying something, but you’re under too much duress to hear her
>But what she’s saying could be your salvation
>Or not
>”It’s all but written in blood already, but…I want to hear it from your own lips.”
>A black, razor claw from her other paw points to your heart
>”Your soul. Will you give it to me?”
>Anything
>You’ll say anything to get your sexual liberation
>You can’t even actually say anything, you just feebly nod your head
>”Mmmm, good. Then let’s get it in ink…”
>When you finally release, it’s a torrent
>There’s no way you could consider this pleasurable
>But somehow you do
>The afterglow of your orgasm is sweeter than the actual thing
>Time freezes, and you reach out with your freed arms for anything to hold for stability
>Your vision returns slowly
>Now you’re lucid enough you see your handiwork
>You coated the hellhound’s stomach with your semen
>The white strands sizzle on her scorching abdomen
>She scoops as much as she can with a finger and licks it off
>It’s then you realize it’s her breasts you were holding on to for stability
>The flesh of her nipples burns your palms like soldering irons
>You can’t let go
>It’s as though the heat fused your hands to her chest
>”Taking the initiative? I like that. We can’t have you all soft and submissive when we start the REAL fun. No no, that’s for afterwards, when I decide to break you.”
>She leans in close to your ear, whispering sinisterly
>”And we haven’t even…’scratched the surface’ yet.”
>Her fangs hover over the opposite side of your neck
>You relive every excruciating moment in a fraction of a second before her pearly daggers even touch your skin
>When they do, the whole process starts all over again
>Rapture mixes with suffering
>Tears pour over shaky smiles
>You’re suffocated by both her enthralling scent and the hearty musk in the room
>Unconsciousness takes you mercifully, though the fleeting laughter of the hellhound follows you into the darkness

>You break out of sleep paralysis
>It’s never been this bad before, but at least it’s all over
>You feel gross, to put it lightly
>Lying in a literal pool of sweat
>You enjoy the sounds of the morning, and the light peeking through the window
>You’re panting heavily long after you rub the sleep from your eyes
>No other dream has been as vivid for you, ever
>Maybe it was some bad food?
>You wonder to yourself what you could have eaten to cause such a nightmare
>But was it really a “nightmare”?
>Now that you’re awake, you can laugh at how afraid you were
>It really wasn’t so bad, right?
>Like analyzing the ridiculousness of a nighttime illusion
>You can pick out the most pleasurable moments and keep them for later
>A little bit of fright was worth that sexual fantasy, wasn’t it?
>”Mmm, I sure think so.”
>Your eyes go wide
>The midnight fur of the hellhound’s arm passes over your eyes as she pulls you into a binding squeeze
>”Just a little bit of fright…and your eternal soul. Wasn’t such a bad tradeoff, hmm?”
>The light outside your window is snuffed out, leaving only a supernatural void
>Your room glows with a hellish red tint, and you can make out the shadows of damned souls looming over your bed
>”Whenever you’re ready, we’ll head back to MY place, little morsel.”
>She grins, then cackles
>And so do the shadows around you
