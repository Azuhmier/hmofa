>Man
>Was that one cool ass adventure, or what?
>You spared and pacified the hell out of all those rogue darkeners that still believed in the King’s words
>But in the end the !$!$ Squad prevailed
>Victorious as always, through the use of anything as long as it isn’t beating their ass to death
>[spoiler]Because that’s bad[/spoiler] 
>You did notice something though
>Susie seemed down in the dumps the entire time you were in the Dark World
>Scratch that, actually
>She was down in the dumps the entire day
>From the moment she got into school she was more aggressive than normal
>Even lashing against you at one point
>She apologized of course, and you accepted it no problem
>Because the moment she lashed out was the moment you knew something was eating her up on the inside
>And you knew that because you asked how was her day and she screamed ‘Everything is god damn fine, Kris’
>So yeah, it was pretty obvious
>You didn’t push it further because you didn’t want her to actually punch you by accident by snapping again
>God knows if she did you’d have a hole through the targeted point
>But now she’s not aggressive anymore, just down
>Sad
>Moody
>Melancholic
>Depressed
>Any of these words apply
>She’s just down, man; even in the dark world she wasn’t really enjoying herself
>Ralsei and Lancer asked you what was up with her, but you could only shrug in response
>You didn’t know it either
>You can only guess something bad happened obviously, but that’s about it
>Though, now that she isn’t aggressive, maybe you can push your luck and not die by accidental punch to the face
>Reaching for the downtrodden Susie, you pull the sleeve of her oversized coat
>She stops in the middle of the school’s hallway
>”What is it Kris?”
>She asks, her voice lacking even less energy than she had by the start of the day
>Again, just like earlier this day, you ask her what’s wrong
>”There… there is nothing wrong Kris”
>And again she replies there is nothing wrong
>Again, you ask
>”I already told you Kris, there’s nothing going on” 
>She shoulders her backpack, and shoves her hands into her coat’s pockets and turns around to walk away
>You follow right after and tell she doesn’t need to be afraid of sharing her problems
>”Look Kris”
>She stops
>Taking her hands out of her pockets, she brings them chest high, with her palms parallel from one another
>”Everything is fine, just drop it, alright?”
>With a quick turn, she again shoves her hands inside her pockets and power walks down the hallway to the school’s entrance
>But you’re having none of that, though
>Running in front of her, you force the purple dragon to stop else she bumps into you and sends you both spiraling down the floor
>Crossing your arms, you give her one of your patented unblinking stares
>It’s a stare known for making people uncomfortable until they fold and spill their secrets
>You hate doing this to your friend but she gave you no choice
>Either fess up or you’ll use the stare
>”C’mon Kris, I don’t have time for this”
>She tries going around you, but you side step every time she does
>Susie could easily pick you up, and put you out of her way
>But she doesn’t
>Spreading your arms wide, you “block” her way, somehow preventing her from going further, and say you’ll only stop if she tells you what’s eating
>”Kris I already said, there’s nothing…”
>She tries to avoid saying anything again until she looks into your eyes and realize you’re not dropping the subject
>She sighs in defeat, shoulders slumping, and worn out backpack sliding from her shoulder, hitting the floor with a thud
>”There is something going on”
>She purses her lips, before squatting on the floor, resting her forearms on her knees
>Sitting down cross legged by her side, you ask what’s going on
>And Susie finally answers
>”It’s… well…”
>She rubs a hand though her hair, making her beautiful eyes visible for a fraction of a second before her fringes fall back in place
>”It’s my dad”
>Her dad?
>”He and I had a pretty heated argument before I left to school”
>”Lots of curses thrown around”
>”He said he wanted me to stop coming to school”
>Oh, wow!
>Why?
>”Because he wants me to work so we can have more money”
>”But he only wants money so he can buy more beer and get high”
>”So I told him no, I have friends here, and I don’t want to end up like him, that’s why I started working harder at school”
>Susie’s sharp teeth clench so hard you can almost hear them grinding
>”But he kept demanding me to quit, so I yelled at him, said that if he wasn’t such a deadbeat dad he’d have a better job and we could have more money”
>”And then…”
>She forces the words through her teeth
>”T-then… then he called me a useless daughter”
>WHAT!?
>>WHAT!?
>“A-and said that it was my fault we live the way we live, and that he wished I was never born so that my mom would still be alive”
>Through her wavering words, Susie clenches her fists until they go white, and bites her lower lips until it draws blood, but refuses to shed any tear
>Jesus Christ
>Her own dad said that to her?
>And you thought you had family issues with your divorced parents and a lonely household with just you and your mom
>But she’s got it way worse
>You don’t even know how to respond
>This isn’t just something you tell your friend to get over, or that it gets better
>…
>You just settle for raising your hand and soothingly rubbing your hand along Susie’s arm
>She stops glaring at the floor and looks at you with a quick appreciative smile, before sighing and frowning again
>You two sit there for what feels like hours
>Susie holding her feelings back with a stone cold face
>And you wracking your brain for any way to help
>Suddenly you feel your phone vibrate, it must be your mom
>It feels inconsiderate to pick the phone when your friend needs you, but it’s also your mom
>Flipping it open, it’s a text message
>Your mom wrote that she knows you said you’d spend time with your friend, but it’s getting late and that you should come back home
>You don’t want to go home
>And you can’t go home
>You don’t want and can’t go home
>Susie needs you now more than ever
>What kind of friend would you be if you abandoned her at her most emotionally vulnerable
>A monster, a true monster, like her father
>No way in hell you’re allowing her go back to her home only to encounter that bastard
>And you can’t go with her either because if you set your eyes on him you won’t control yourself
>>And you can’t go with her either because if you set your eyes on him you won’t control yourself
>Think, Kris, think…
>!!!
>That’s it
>You snap your fingers
>Jumping to your feet, you grab Susie’s hand, eliciting a cute yelp and blush on her face, and hurriedly pull her through the hallways
>”W-wait, Kris, where are you taking me?!”
>You’ll see
>…

>…
>”Oh Kris, you’re home”
>Your mom looks up from her book as soon as you walk through the threshold that is the front door
>”How was your day with your… friend… oh”
>And right behind you, comes in a mighty flustered Susie
>Yep
>That’s right
>You brought her right to your home
>Halfway through you told Susie you were taking her to your house
>Of course, she refused on the spot
>But then you asked if she preferred going back to her own home
>It might’ve been a dick move to say that, but you’re dead set on making your friend feel better
>So you invited her to spend the night on your home
>You don’t know how your mom will reacting, seeing she knows Susie is the school’s delinquent
>But you hope her good nature will shine in the end and she’ll accept Susie not only being your friend, but also being in the house
>You say your day was great
>Mom narrows her eyes at you in that way she always does when suspicious
>But you said no lie, so her lie detection stare doesn’t work on you
>Mom puts her book on the table and stood up slowly
>She steps forward toward you two with slow, calculated steps
>And from behind you can hear a gulp
>It’s always funny when Susie is nervous or flustered given her general attitude
>”So… you’re the friend my son has been spending time with, huh?”
>She asks, this time sending her stare to your purple friend
>”Y-yes ma’am”
>Susie stammers out, practically shaking on her spot in front of the surprisingly imposing, towering goat mom
>Your mother leans forward right into Susie’s face with her eye still narrowed
>She turns her head left and right, your friend turning her head the opposite way to avoid eye contact
>Your mother looks like a she’s examining some piece of art for any imperfections before making her purchase, humming all the way through
>Before Susie can react, your mom take both of her hands and clasp them within hers, with a huge smile on her face
>”Oh, that’s wonderful! After my son told me he met a friend, he has been much friendlier”
>She brings hers and Susie’s hands close to her heart
>”Eh…?”
>You smirk as your friend can only look bafflingly towards your mom
>”Everyday he comes home more cheerful, and has even started to dedicate himself more at school”
>Your mother lets go of Susie’s hands and holds her own cheeks, wiggling happily in place
>”Oh… OH! Oh, i-it’s nothing Mrs. Toriel”
>Susie rubs the back of her head embarrassedly
>”But it is, my little Kris has always been so distant from everyone, especially after Asriel went to college, and after meeting you he’s been much more open, even the neighbors said that he’s a lost more talkative now”
>Your mom then surprises Sussie with a hug
>Wrapping her within her big goat arms, and squishing the poor dragon’s face to her chest and shaking left and right
>Susie’s sole visible looks at you desperately, wishing, begging, for you to help her
>And all you do is give her a smirk and a finger waggle
>After ten more seconds of intensive, one sided hugging
>”Please, make yourself at home, sweetie, you can stay for as long as you want!”
>She lets go of her hug and allows Susie to stumble out of her embrace
>”However”
>Your mother speak in a tone a little more commanding
>Now taking a better look at Susie from top to bottom, she places a white furry hand on her chin
>”I’ll not allow you in my home this filthy”
>You frown a little
>That’s a little harsh
>If you weren’t paying attention you wouldn’t have noticed your friend flinching just a little
>A look of understand on her eyes, like she expected something like this to happen, you were about talk to your mom when her next act surprises you
>She suddenly surprises Susie by snatching her hand and dragging her to the end of the house
>Mainly
>The bathroom
>Oh!
>You get it now
>”You’re gonna take a shower, pronto”
>”WHAT!?”
>Susie shouts in shock
>”Exactly, and then I’m gonna put you in some proper clothing, you shouldn’t be wearing rags like that”
>Susie’s monster strength betrays her as she struggles with all her might
>Pulling her arm, trying to pull your mom fingers, digging her shoes on the floor
>Yet all is futile, she’s completely incapable of overpowering your mom’s own grip strength
>Soon, your mother passes the door to the bathroom, and all you can witness is Susie stretching her hand towards you with a desperate look on her 
>”Wait, NO! KRIS, HELP ME!”
>You only wave her good bye with a smile on your face as the door closes behind the two
>Well
>Guess all you have to do is wait
>You then hear the door opening again, and the sound of struggle inside
>”Oh, and Kris”
>You turn to your mom’s head poking from the crack of the open door, eyes narrowed at you
>”No peaking”
>Before closing the door again, a click sound signifying she locked it from inside
>You can only stand there in mild disbelief before shrugging your shoulders
>Your mom has always been kind of a prude
>You still remember how she forced your whole family to attend church every single day for like, a week, just because Bratty kissed your brother
>How that woman got pregnant being as prude as she is you have no clue
>Unless… you ponder
>Squatting down and rubbing your chin, you continue to wonder
>Did your parents ever do the dirty?
>Mom and Dad never, you know, locked the door to their room and started “play-fighting”
>Your room is literally right next to your mom’s and you never heard it happen, ever
>And with the way your mom acts, it seems she never got freaky under the sheets with your dad
>Despite being married with him
>For years
>Did… did Asriel came from artificial insemination?!
>Is your mom a virgin?!
>Is your dad a virgin too?!
>You remember your brother being really shy around the subject too, even as a young adult ready to go to college
>Does it run in the family?
>Jesus Christ, if were to be true you don’t think you’d survive the ensuing bout of laughter
>Your rather bizarre train of thought is interrupted when you hear your mom calling
>”Kris, be a dear and pick a pair of clothes for your friend, please”
>You guess that’s enough of making fun of the Dreemur family in your mind
>Yeah, you’re a Dreemur too, but you’re adopted, you don’t count
>Shouting a response, you place your hands on your bent knees and stand up with a grunt, before going upstairs to fetch some clean clothes for Susie
>Can’t pick yours, you’re too small
>If it fits, it would be incredibly tight, and you doubt she’d feel comfortable
>Maybe your mom’s?
>She’s huge, but so is Susie, and she’s not far from your mom’s height
>You could pick Asriel’s, but last time you saw him he was kind of in the twink size
>Sure he has all these trophies, but he was always the lean muscle type, not like Susie who has clearly defined muscle structure
>Guess you’ll go for your mom’s
>You pick the shortest shirt you can find, one that won’t look like a dress on your friend, and a pair of shorts with shoelaces so it can be tied in place
>Panties though…
>Your mom’s problem, not yours
>Leaving her room, you go downstairs and knock on the bathroom’s door
>Rather than struggle, you’re now hearing the sound of scrubbing
>Gotta scrub really hard mom, Susie’s got tough scales
>At least you assume she does
>She can take as much pain as she dishes out
>The scrubbing stops and you hear your mother telling Susie to stay still
>The door opens just enough for your mom to poke her head out again and you give her the clothes
>She takes them and nods in appreciation and for taking consideration with picking what to give her
>But before going back in, she looks at the clothes and notices you apparently don’t
>”Uhmm, what about the, you know…”
>She looks back, before motioning you to lean closer and whispers with a slight blush
>”The panties”
>You answer with a raised eyebrow and a deadpan look, before giving her a once over
>For a moment she doesn’t get it, only for her eyes to light up with realization as she blushes
>”Oh… right… too big”
>She whispers the last one for herself, but you can still hear
>Your quick chuckle is responded with a playful glare, before your mother disappears back into the bathroom
>With nothing else to do, you hang around the kitchen and living room to stall
>Taking maybe a snack or two from the fridge
>Turning on the TV to see if there’s anything worthwhile being broadcasted
>Huh
>An interview on the news
>Officer Undyne caused another traffic accident by crashing her cruiser against a civilian’s car
>”I’m telling you, he was speeding so I was had to stop him! It was totally called for”
>”You crashed my car through the Police Department’s entrance!”
>”But I got you didn’t I? That’s what matters”
>”I wasn’t even in my car you dimwit!” 
>“Oh yeah, then how do you explain it being in the road? Ha!”
>”It was parked by the side walk!”
>”Then tell me why was it blur when I passed by it?
>”Because you were the one speeding, you dumbass!”
>”Oh…”
>Ahh, Officer Undyne, you’ll never get tired of her
>She’s the one shining star of craziness to balance out the mundanity of your city
>Every week she’s on the news, usually due to something stupid
>But because she’s the only reliable cop
>As in
>The only one with the dedication to fight crime
>They keep her as an Officer
>Undyne is forced to do community service and help repair any damages she deals, however
>Your attention from the TV is interrupted when you hear the bathroom door clicking open
>Out comes your mom, a little wet but overall normal
>And right after comes a slightly flustered Susie
>She’s wearing the clothes you picked for her
>A yellow t-shirt that despite being the smallest you could find, still looked big on her
>And a pair of white shorts you can only see half of them because of how long the shirt is on her
>Her purple scales look all super shiny and vibrant
>And her once greyish hair is now gone, revealing it to actually be brown just like yours
>She also has a small band aid on her lip where she bit it earlier this day
>All in all, she looks cute
>Super cute actually
>”Alright you two”
>Mom claps her hands, getting both of your attention
>”Now that you’re all cleaned up, you two can go upstairs and have fun while I make a snack for you two”
>She says, going for the kitchen while leaving you two alone
>”W-wait, I wouldn’t want to impose”
>Susie stammers out, holding out a hand to stop your goat of a mom
>”You’re not imposing at all dear, Kris never brings any friends home”
>Wow mom, thanks for rubbing in everyone’s face how much of a loner you are
>Or at least used to be
>“I’m more than happy to make something for you two”
>She hums, opening up the fridge and cupboards, picking up the ingredients and utensils for whatever she’s gonna prepare
>Probably Butterscotch and Cinnamon Pie
>”Oh, and don’t worry about your clothes, I’ll clean and fix them right after, they’ll be as good as new”
>”Y-you don’t need to”
>Susie says quietly
>Her tone is one of confusion
>Bewilderment
>”But I want to, besides, it’s something else to do in this boring house other than bake pies and read boo-“
>”Why?…”
>Your friend interrupt your mom out of the blue with a quiet question
>”Hmm?”
>Your mother stops what she’s doing
>“Don’t you know who I am!?”
>Susie nearly screams, slamming a hand over her chest, 
>“You’re Susie, right?”
>The purple dragon can only nod at your mother’s guess
>“The school’s delinquent, am I correct?”
>She nods again, albeit slower this time
>“If you know who I am, then why are you being so nice to me!?”
>You could see it in her eyes, she couldn’t understand why someone like your mother, who’s such a nice person, would ever care for a troublemaker delinquent who liked to hurt classmates like her
>Who even threatened her own son
>’I have no right to be treated this nicely’ is what’s most likely swimming around her head right now
>“Susie, let me tell you something”
>Your mother sighs, going into lecture mode
 >”I don’t know if you realized it or not, but befriending you had a great impact on my son’s life”
>”He used to be so sad all the time, disobedient, play mean pranks on his schoolmates, and no matter what I did I couldn’t get him to stop”
>”I thought that he would grow up to become miserable, and it pained my heart that I was unable to help him in any way”
>Your mother places a hand over her chest, where her heart is
>”Then one day imagine my surprise when he tells me he was spending time with a friend instead of just coming straight to home and locking himself inside his room”
>”And that after that day, he’d slowly start to open up, he became more outgoing, and more talkative”
>“I never expected you to be such friend, but right now I don’t care who you are, because you did something very special”
>Mom states, walking closer to Susie, who looks at her with wide eyes
>”You made my son happier, and that’s all I care for”
>She clasps her hands on the dragon’s shoulders, giving her a bright smile, before hugging the baffled girl
>”And I can tell he had the same effect on you, since I heard less and less of you being mean on school”
>Your mother finishes her speech by softly booping Susie on her snout, giving her a genuine smile
>Your friend can only stare back in shock, processing the words spoken to her with her jaw slightly ajar
>Her lips tremble for a moment before she purses them, clenching shaking hands and giving your mother a nod with a small smile of her own
>Patting her on the head, your mother turns around and returns to the kitchen
>And you, you take Susie’s hand and slowly lead her upstairs to your room
>You swear you saw your friend rubbing her eyes with her arm, but when you look back she looks as normal as ever
>Well
>As normal as she’d look with brightly colored, even more oversized than her own, clothing
>Reaching your room, you spread your arms
>Home sweet home
>”So this is where you sleep”
>She comments, her bare feet thumping against the floor as she looks around the room
>Of course, she’s immediately attracted to your brother’s side of the room
>For obvious reasons
>She looks over the shelf with all of Asriel’s trophies and medals for participating in sports and academic events, his computer, and all that jazz that he has
>You sit on your bed with a leg crossed over the other
>Elbow resting on a knee, and your face resting on your knuckle
>Watching with a smile as Susie’s curiosity takes a hold of her
>When she turns around, she stops completely when she sees your side of the room
>Bleak
>Greyed out
>Your shelf, now a little bit filled with a single framed picture, is still very much empty when compared to your brother’s
>A single lamp on your drawer
>And a little red wagon with a birdcage in it
>”Is this… your side of the room?”
>She asks with a raised eyebrow
>And you give her a nod
>”But why is it this bland when the other side is so flowery?”
>You shrug
>You were never really liked asking things from your parents, you say
>So your room ended up reflecting that
>Not to say they didn’t try, they offered multiple times, but you simply refused all the times
>You never really found any reason to ornate your side of the room
>Always thought such things were meaningless in the end
>You don’t say, however, that you always found them meaningless and never cared for them because of your depression
>You found it meaningless until now, at least
>After meeting a certain someone
>”Oh yeah?”
>Susie smirks, resting her hands on her hips
>”And who would that certain someone be?”
>Why, Lancer of course
>…
>You two stare at each other for a total of ten seconds before no one can handle it anymore and you all burst out laughing
>Still laughing, you stand up and motion her toward Asriel’s computer
>Since he isn’t home, you can use it all you want
>And you filled it to the brim with video games
>Video games you two are gonna spend the rest of the day playing
>Booting it up, you proceed to crouch down and reach under the bed to pull two controllers, and with Susie’s help; you pull the bed closer to the PC, so you two can sit on the edge and still reach it
>”Video games, huh?”
>She plops down with a smile
>”So what are we playing?”
>A little game known as Culprit Cog Zrd –Revelation-
>”Culprit Cog? Never heard of it”
>Yeah, Culprit Cog is the real deal of fighting games
>Not that Super Smashing Fighters your brother preferred 
>That’s a fighting game for babies
>You play real fighters that require real skill
>You can play fighting games, right? You ask
>”I played a few yeah, I’m good, I won’t embarrass myself if that’s what you think”
>She gives you a shit eating grin, and you smirk back
>Giving Susie the official controller, you keep the cheap knock off for yourself
>Don’t want her to give her an unfair disadvantage with a worse controller
>Starting up the game, you pick your characters and start playing
>You win the first and second matches easily
>Looking to the side, you see Susie’s frustrated face, and decide to let her win the next match
>Except she doesn’t just win the next match
>She wins all the next matches
>Susie’s beating your ass to hell and back
>Heaven or Hell
>Duel infinitely
>Let’s rock Kris’ ass
>Multiple perfects even
>What the hell?
>You lose again, and look at her
>She’s giving you that same shit eating grin from before
>Then you look at the controller in her hands and the one in your hands
>And say that she’s only winning because she’s got the good controller
>”You think so, big boy?”
>She mocks you
>“Alright then, let’s switch pads”
>Switching controller, you proceed to have your face turned into a wet rag to wipe the floor with
>Because that’s exactly what she does
>She must’ve seen the incredulous look you were giving her because she starts laughing before patting you on the back
>”Don’t be mad, not everyone can be awesome like me”
>She pokes her chest with a thumb
>”Besides, I frequent the arcade a lot, I know my way around fighting games, especially Culprit Cog”
>Raising a hand, she rubs your hair, disheveling your hair and you pout
>”But c’mon, it was fun wasn’t it”
>Your pout stays put on your face for a few seconds before it turns into a smile and you nod
>The gaming session continues with you two playing not just Culprit Cog, but a few other games as well
>You have the time of your life, having fun, laughing at how bad one performs, or cheering when someone succeeds
>When your mom finally shows up with snacks
>It is, surprisingly, not Butterscotch and Cinnamon Pie
>But vanilla cake instead, two slices for each of you
>Not that you mind, her cakes are just as good as her pies
>So much so the entire neighborhood knows of her talent for making sweets, specially cakes and pies
>Hell they only aren’t known worldwide because your mom refuses to sell them even though she’d make a killer profit
>When it comes time to eat it, you notice Susie’s eyes widen in pure delight once she tastes it, and pretty much down the entire slice of cake in one go
>And so does it for the second
>Once she’s done, there’s a sad look in her eyes, because there’s no more cake to eat
>She really likes her cake, huh?
>She demanded Ralsei to make cake for her, and searched for that guy who makes cakes so he could make more for her
>You take your plate and offer her your own slices
>”No, I can’t take this, it’s yours”
>Is what she says, but her eyes hungers for your cake
>You admit to her, however, that you had a quick snack while waiting for your mom to finish bathing her, so you’re not hungry
>After that she takes your slice with a quiet thanks, and eats it at a much slower pace, savoring every bite of the, most likely, delicious cake
>After eating, you two decide to spend some more time playing videogames on your brother’s computer
>”Kris, Susie”
>Your mom calls and you pause Demon Might Weep 5
>You two turn your heads toward the door to see your mom poking her head inside the room
>”It’s getting late, don’t you think it’s time for Susie to go home?”
>Susie immediately grows stiff at the suggestion
>After hearing what she said earlier about her scuffle with her dad
>You don’t want her to go home just as much as she doesn’t
>So you lie
>You jump in and tell your mother that Susie actually came not just to spend time, but for a sleep over
>”Oh, a sleepover, and are her parents okay with this?”
>Yes, you respond
>”Susie, are your parents okay with you spending the night?”
>Susie, still rigid, shakes her head to break herself out of her stupor
>”Y-yeah, my father let me stay her for the night”
>Mom narrows her eyes just a little
>Susie’s stammer of a response didn’t help her case at all
>When her eyes pass over you, you give her a pleading look to let the matter go
>That you’ll explain it later
>Surprisingly, your mom smiles and nods
>”Well then, if your father allowed, I guess you can stay”
>By your side, you feel Susie growing much more relaxed, a silent sigh of relief almost making her deflate from the sudden pent up anxiety
>”Still, it’s getting late, and it doesn’t matter if tomorrow is Saturday, you’ll sleep early so you can wake up early and fully enjoy the day”
>”So c’mon, to bed both of you, actually, not you Kris; you need to take a shower, then you go to bed”
>She says before slinking out to do whatever
>Turning off the computer and putting the controller down, you stand up and stretch, before turning to the door so you can go take a shower
>As you turn however, a hand grabs the sleeve of your sweater
>You turn to find Susie looking at you with an appreciative smile
>”Thanks for bailing me out Kris…”
>You smile and give her a thumbs-up before making your way out
>The shower is uneventful
>Your mother left you a change of clothes in the form of a sleeveless white shirt and a pair of blue shorts
>When you return to your room, the lights are out, and Susie is already sleeping on your brother’s bed
>Your mom must’ve told her to use it
>You’d think that with her being that prude, she’d force Susie to sleep on her room
>Perhaps she trusts you not to do anything
>Not that you would’ve anyway
>You used to be creepy, but not like that
>Approaching Susie’s bed, you look at her still frame, chest rising up and down slowly
>She looks so peaceful right now that you'd never guess what she went through today
"Good night, Susie"
>You say out loud, before doing a one-eighty and going directly to your bed
>Smiling to yourself, you climb onto your bed and slide under the covers
>You had a great day
>But most importantly, you cheered up your friend
>And with these thoughts swimming through your mind, you finally start to sleep
>The soul that now resides within you not a problem anymore as you both found a compromise
>When you were finally fading into sweet dreams, however, you’re startled awake by something heavy climbing on your bed
>Rather than do the sensible thing of getting up and possibly screaming to alert your mom that there’s someone climbing on your bed
>You decide to stay still, keep your eyes closed and pretend to still be sleeping
>There’s no malicious intent or aura coming from whoever this person is
>And that’s because it’s Susie, you realize
>She climbs onto your bead, and pulls the covers so she can slide down
>Worming herself closer, she ends up spooning you, placing an arm over your side to hug you close to her chest
>”Hey Kris”
>Susie whispers on your ear
>You can hear her voice faltering just a bit
>”Thanks for everything you did, that was the nicest thing someone ever did to me...”
>You place your own hand over Susie’s and hear a gasp behind him, before giving her hand a squeeze
>She lets out a shuddering breath that doesn’t stop until it turns into a sob
>When you hear her sobbing, and feel her body rocking to her cries, you turn in place and wrap your own arms around her, holding her tight and letting her bury her face on your hair 
>”Thank you..”
