>Be Anon.
>You're a drifter, wandering the streets.
>It's rainy out, and you don't have the money for a hotel.
>Decide to just spend the night in some unoccupied house.
>Break down the door like a bad-ass who doesn't give a fuck.
>Just kidding.
>Bust the latch on an old window and climb in.
>The house seems pretty old, and kinda spooky if you're being honest with yourself.
>Whatever. It's dry at least, and that's all you care about.
>After a short while of looking through the home, you settle down in what looks like an old bedroom.
>The bed is even still made.
>It's a bit dusty, but who cares?
>Take off your shoes and coat, hanging them up to dry.
>Leave your other clothes on though, because you don't trust this bedding very much.
>Cover up and fall asleep, listening to the rain patter against the windows.
 
>For once, you have a pretty nice dream.
>You're sitting there with a beautiful Anthro dog girl.
>She has short, light gray fur, and long silky black hair.
>All around QT.
>Give her the good head-pats.
>She smiles and mlems at you, before leaning down to give you succ.
>Shitsisocash.jpg
>Feel yourself bust down her throat, and sigh happily.
>You begin to wake up, satisfied with yourself.
>You try and fight to stay asleep, but it's no use.
>Dammit!
 
>You wake up, but It's still dark out. Still raining, too.
>Hmm... Something's off...
>Realize your dick still feels like it's being succ'ed
>wat.png
>Look down and see a lump under the cover on your legs
>Try and jump out of bed, but you're being held down by the weight of whatever is on top of you
>Nervously pull back the covers, and see >pic related. ( https://e621.net/post/show/1388358/anthro-bed_covers-bedding-black_and_blue-black_scl )
>aaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
>Cum down her throat as her black, souless eyes stare into yours.
>She gives you a mischievous wink.
 
>You try to scramble out of the bed, but the ghost lady won't get off of you.
>She grins warmly at you, and clambers up closer to you, your juices still dripping from her smiling lips.
>Stops just short of your face.
>Thank god. you don't think you could handle a smooch from this thing.
>Your fears double though as she suddenly sits up, throwing the blankets off of the two of you as she straddles your crotch.
>She's stark naked, and dripping wet.
>Oh. Fuck.
>With one hand on your chest, she uses her other hand to guide your semi-erect dick inside of her sopping wet loins.
>Jesus Christ, she's warmer inside than you expected!
>Not as warm as a "normal" woman, but still nice and tight.
>It doesn't take much of this sensation before you're rock hard inside her.
>She closes her eyes, a happy smile on her face.
>Without warning, she drops her full weight (she's lighter than she looks...) onto your hips, hilting you inside of her.
>She begins to slowly roll her hips, grinding herself against your shaft.
>Her tongue pops out of her mouth in a cute manner, and she lets out a light huff every time your cock rubs against her walls.
>Soon, it seems she's had enough of grinding.
>She lifts herself just a couple inches off of you, then slams back down.
>oof.webm
>She doesn't bother with building up to a steady rhythm, instead choosing to wildly rut against you.
>Shit, this is getting to you...
>Try to resist the urge to thrust back up into her
>It's no use! it's been too long since you've had something like this...
>Besides. if she's going to kill you or something after this is over, you might as well enjoy it!
>Shakily put your hands on her cool, fuzzy hips, and begin to gently thrust back up against her.
>In an instant, her eyes are staring into yours again.
>Her tongue flops out, a bead of slick moisture dropping onto your chest.
>She happily pants as the two of you fuck, seemingly satisfied that you're reciprocating her affection.

>Goddamn it. this was not how you expected to spend your night.
>Still though, it could be worse.
>Ghost pussy is still pussy.
>At least you didn't wake up to some ghostly furboi trying to fuck you.
>The two of you fuck like two well-seasoned lovers expressing your passion your one another.
>Eventually though, you have to force yourself to slow down.
>You've feared this moment.
>You have to cum.
>Fearing what she might do if you came inside of her without permission, you shakily tell her that you were gonna pull out.
>In an instant, your vision goes red, a splitting pain searing through your head like a migraine from hell.
>Blinking, you can see that your "lover" is drenched in blood, stab wounds covering her body.
>Her hand is tight against your throat, a low growl emitting from what used to be her neck.
>SHIT! SHIT! SHIT!
>OKAY YOU'll CUM INSIDE!
>Like it never even happened, she's back to "normal" as soon as the words leave your mouth.
>She hits her own climax, her walls contracting around your dick.
>Fuck!
>It's too much!
>You cum deep inside of her, your seed spilling out around your cock.
>She happily sighs, before lifting up a bit.
>Your dick flops out of her, and she curls up on top of you, her soft fur acting better than any blanket you've ever had.
>Weird... you can't seem to keep your eyes open...
>You try to choke out a couple words, but you just can't.
>Instead, your head hits the pillow, and you're out like a light.
>When you wake up the next morning, you find that the ghost pupper is gone.
>You sit up, a bit of light cutting through the rain.
>Well, it was still rainy, but at least it was day now.
>It wasn't very bright out, but what else could you expect from a rainy morning?
>Still though, you can at least see your surroundings.
>You're laying on top of the bed, wearing only your shirt.
>The blanket is on the floor, but your clothes are nowhere to be found.
>Shit, wheres my socks?
>Or your underwear? Or your fucking pants!?
>Goddammit! That bitch stole your clothes!
>You groan, standing out of bed.
>Oh wait, there's your clothes.
>They're sitting on a nightstand next to where you hung your coat and boots.
>They're neatly folded.
>Well, that's pretty unsettling. Still nice though.
 
>Soon enough, you're fully clothed and back out the window.
>You put your hood up, walking out on the rainy sidewalk.
>Before you leave, you take one last look at the house from the sidewalk.
>Right before you look away, you see something out of the corner of the eye.
>It's the ghost pupper, peering at you with a smile from one of the windows.
>The second you turn to get a better look at her though, she disappears.
>A chill creeping down your spine, you turn away and walk on down the road.
