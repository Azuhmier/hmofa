>the doctor pinches between her eyes at the base of her snout
>turning to the ugly nurse and saying something before promptly walking off
>this keeps happening for a while
>the nurse and doctor come in every so often, looking into your eyes, adjusting or checking some equipment in the room before leaving
>they check your heart a lot, seeming concerned but never saying anything about it
>your sleeps are short and hardly restful, everything feels slower than you feel it should
>gradually your vision cleared up and your neck relaxed , letting you analyse more of the room
>there were two windows now, one smaller one off to your right, facing out to the sky and another larger one to your right with a sheet of dark, faintly reflective glass, a one way window
>probably someone or something behind it right now watching you
>Looking out the other window you'd say it's about noon with how bright the sunlight pouring through is
>your other senses like your vision had cleared up far more too, the sensation of the sun on your skin was amazing to say the least, a crisp warmth that fought off the stubborn chill that stubbornly clung to your bones
>a noise grabs your attention,the nurse enters the room again
>With your vision clear you finally get a good look at them, it's not that they were ugly you reflect, more that they were well.
>a monkey
>a short snout with two openings on a face of grey-brown flanked by frizzy blonde fur framing her face giving you its characteristic toothy grin
>beside the the nurse is a new creature, a tall thing that's unmistakably a wolf
>lanky and grey-white, dressed in simple dark grey clothes outlined with black trims, a suit perhaps.

>sporting a stern expression they hardly pay you any mind, the wolf focusing all its attention on the monkey, listening intently as the primate explains, golden eyes flicking toward you every other word
>the monkey nurse gestures towards you and leaves the room, leaving you to the wolf
>the wolf grabs the empty chair and drags it over to the side of your bed, sitting down to stare at you cooly
>you feel like a piece of defrosted meat again
>the wolf clicks their fingers, digits, claws? together to grab your attention and locks eyes with you
>he says something slowly but this time it's not the gibberish the cat or the monkey have been mouthing
>it's something you vaguely recognise for once, an eastern language it sounds like.but it feels off.
>the words aren't pronounced right, it's also coming out of a wolf’s mouth which doesn't help much
>the wolf speaks slowly and deliberately. Apparently also unfamiliar with the language , gazing intently into your eyes looking for any hint of understanding
>they pause for a moment, waiting for your reply.
>they frown slightly before speaking again this time another language, another one that feels familiar but makes no sense to you

>the wolf is annoyed now
>the two of you have sat and lay staring at one another for what must be hours
>the wolf reciting a few sentences in unfamiliar tongues, waiting for your reply before sighing and speaking another
>they're pacing the room now, tail and ears flicking in agitation
>it seems a lightbulb has popped into its mind as it twists round to look at you, digging a paw into one of its coat pockets, pulling out a small notepad of sorts, flicking through the pages until it spots what it wants
>the wolf returns to the chair and sits beside you, eyes flicking between yourself and the note
>"d̷o̴ ̴y̸o̴u̸ ̶u̶n̷d̶e̴r̵s̵t̸a̶n̵d̸ ̴t̵h̸i̷s̸" the canine states, slowly and hopefully
>the pronunciation is again, horrific but you know this one and nod slowly
>the wolf's eyes widen at your response, checking its notepad again before throwing its arms up into the air with a sigh of relief
>the canid reaches over and pats your shoulder, getting up and walking off out of the room
>you notice their tail is wagging slightly

>-

>the nurse, the doctor and the suited wolf return regularly, the former to do their regular activities, the latter to talk to you in broken english
>the nurse and doctor too are speaking to you in the same butchered english, basic greetings and chcks of your welfare to asking where the library is
>you get the impression neither really know what they're saying
>the wolf however has an idea, conversing with you regularly, asking broken and poorly pronounced questions that are thankful yes or no in nature for simplicity
>you nod and shake
>mostly it's been questions about your condition ,if you're cold, if you feel okay, if you understand and remember me?
>today however they've brought someone new with them. a diminutive rodent thing with a slab of thin plastic clutched in tiny claws
>the rodent says nothing, just watching as the wolf converses with you
>today it's more complicated questions, involving pictures no less
>the wolf holds up a few cards with basic sketches of items on them
>fruit, trees, clouds, something, a machine of some kind and a crudely drawn impression of a dog or fox, maybe the wolf's self portrait
>they point at each and say a word in their language
>you get the idea, you point at the associated card for each word, repeating it yourself for the ones you know and shaking your head when the wolf holds up one you don't
>the rat raises an eyebrow, tapping away at the plastic
>the wolf does this a few times with new cards, moving on to increasingly elaborate drawings which grow more and more confusing
>the latest card shows you a jumble of lines criss crossing each other on the bottom, heading and inserting into the sides of some tube like shape with jagged edges around it
>you stare at this one, you know what it is
>the wolf taps the card
> you don't want to think about that place again
>you look away from the card, the wolf looks confused, looking to its rodent companion before asking you something broken
>"Cold." is all you say
>the wolf frowns and goes to say something, but a tap on the arm by the rodent shuts its maw before it can continue, they get up and leave, taking the cards with them and leaving you be for now
