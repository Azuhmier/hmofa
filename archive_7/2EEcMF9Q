>or at least you "tried" because everytime you comment that offends them, they will always retaliate with hateful words such as, "fuck you" as an example
>though internet is slow cause: old PC, you still can manage
>back to IRL
>you carried the ribbon and walked toward the heavy camel anthro
>the artificial light bulb is flickering, indicating that outside was dangerous because of either sandstorms or the sun lasers
>your room was not-so-average afte all, with only a single window and a spacious floor, you could not mistaken this as a shed because this was a shed by the rich people who once lived on this former lake.

>you nod and hand her the red ribbon
>your still Anon, and right now you were trying your hardest to stare at the wall
>particularly since undergarments in this region is so underrated because of the heat in this desert
>as a result you find yourself ogling at al's supple ass, firm yet very sens-
>you quickly look at a wall of your 'home'
>instead you should focus on the past so you can distract yourself from the present

>a long time ago, when you were the abandoned by your original family.
>most likely after the civil conflict
>you were adopted in the spot by a very conservative family, one that strictly forbids you from marrying a anthro
>the mother as it turns out was very infertile due to some biological result, the father is the same too with his sperm missing tails or something.
>they gave you shelter(this shed), they gave you luxury (your ancient computer), and most importantly they gave you food( mostly crackers and carbohydrates) and water (though it is a new pump from outside, the water is still contaminated with underground dirt)
>and they are against Anthros because of an unexplained disappearance of your uncle
>"W-woah"
>the ladder rattled and you instinctively held it still
>it stopped but not before looking up
>al melwah was staring at you, her eyes focused on your eyes as your eye 'incidentally' focused at her exposed camel vagina
>it looked a black-pinkish and moist, fantasies ran wild as-
>"Ahm, Anon"
>your attention was snapped back to al

>she was currently doing the same thing over and over again: fiddling with the ribbon
>is she doing this on purpose?
>...
>nah, she'll  maybe say that she's done soon
>for now you flee the scene as you kept staring at her while she swayed left and right with her boobs being with the notion coincidentally
>You kept yourself cool when you put enough distance with her, at least it's finally almost finished
>But you can't figure out what the familiar feeling that you are having in the back of your mind
>Hold on a minute, Oh no; the assingment

>Be Anon, the helpful eccentric
>Staring at the distance while someone carrying you
>And right now you're considering why you didn't ask your parents why they didn't bought you a blindfold instead of a coin container that resembles a pig, and jotted with colorful charcters, not those anthro ones mind you
>It was shaped like a pre-anthrofied pig
>At least you'll save enough money for a rope perhaps?
>Or maybe it's a old vintage in the past, possibly
>While you gazed at the wasteland looking ass desert a paw shook your legs
>"Anon! Why do you keep staring at the distance?"
>Spinning your head to face al, she smirked at the position the two of you were
>Currently you were riding her, in her back "hump" of course
>She said it was alright she said, you wont fall she said
>But she was right and now you were wishing that you did
>"Heh, enjoying this Anon?"
>No of course you aren't, because you were actively groping her large breasts of a busts
>You replied that you are not, and saying why she thinks that this is a good idea
>"It's because the area we're travelling to is far and your human body is not made to sweat almost non-stop at the plain sun"
>Now you remember why yo-
>"Ahh-"
>That was al!

>Your now falling
>Unexpectedly of course
>It happened so fast that you could see blurs while weightlessness gave your body a tome of pain
>You can feel yourself spinning and at the same time trying your best not to barf your contents inside your stomach
>al wasn't faring any better too
>Her camel body can only do much when falling down
>You can see glimpses of her flaying her limbs trying to hold on to something
>When the world stopped doing random motions, you clenched your hand into a fist and felt something soft and fatty
>You blinked rapidly and looked up to see al blushing up a storm because...
>"Ekk! A-ANON WHATAREYO-"
>You in instinct jump off her(not literally), and apologized profusely that it makes Asian bows a better one
>"I, I forgive you Anon"
>You sighed in relief
>She strides towards and leaned next to your ear
>"But I wouldn't mind if you do it again♥"
>Your breathing hitched as her hot breathe sensation it strangely erotic without a reason
>Naturally you blushed and blush Hard
>And finally, you get up and turn to her and said
"I-uhhh, do you have water?"
