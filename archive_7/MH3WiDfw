>Blue sky
>Man, I always wondered why the sky was blue
>There was something about reflecting the ocean or some shit like that, I don’t know
>I take a deep breath, continuing to watch the sky
>Laying with back on my board, from my spot in the ocean
>Not too far from the beach
>Not too far into the ocean
>Perfect place to catch some rad waves
>All thanks to my girl
>If it weren’t for her, I wouldn’t be able to come all the way here
>Having a dolphin for a girlfriend sure has its perks
>She can bring me far from the beach where no one will be on the way
>And can keep me from drowning or stray away into the ocean
“Oh yeah, this is the good stuff”
>I speak to myself, closing my eyes and stretching my arms, before setting them under my head
“Nothing better than just lay back and rest after riding some waves”
>I make myself more comfortable
>The soothing waves rocking me and my board starts to take an effect on me
>And I feel my conscious slipping away, and getting dragged into the dream realm
>I wake up a few minutes later to the sound of water sloshing near me
>I groggily open my eyes and turn my head to the side just in time to see a grey fin coming at me at blistering speed
“JESUS SHIT!”
>I yell in surprise while I sit up, raising my arms and closing my eyes, knowing I was done for
>There was no way I could outswim a shark
>I scream just as something burst out of the water and jumps on top of me
>Shoving my back against the board and rocking it back while grabbing me by my shoulders
“Boo!”
>My scream slowly fades into nothing as I open my eyes
>And there she was, sitting on my lap
>My girlfriend, her wet and smooth dolphin skin glistened under the sun’s rays as she looked up at me from her spot in the water
>She had with a grin on her muzzle, and was covering it to hold back her laughter
>We stare at each other before she can’t take anymore and starts laughing
“Ha, you actually fell for that?”
>She tries to reign in her laughter, but her grin grows wider when she notices I’m not laughing with her 
“Oh, come on, you gotta admit it was funny”
>I cross my arms and close my eyes, humming to myself
“Okay, it was a little bit funny”
>I give her a smile, and he smiles back
“But, do you wanna know what’s even funnier?”
>She leans her head to the side
“What?”
“This!”
>I spring forward and throw my arms around her torso
>She squeals in surprise before I send us into the water, and the two of us start to playfully wrestle with one another 
>We have our hands interlocked as I try to push her into the water, but her superior strength keeps me at bay
>I have a trick up my currently nonexistent sleeve, however 
>I let go of one of her hands and swiftly swipe it down at her chest
>And suddenly her breasts lay bare for the entire world to see
>She gasps and sinks down until the water covered her breasts
>Not missing a beat, I place a hand on her head and push her down even further into the water
>Now it’s my turn to start laughing at her as she slowly emerges from the water with her cheeks puffed in anger
>Her arms covering her exposed bosom 
“Now why are you covering your chest? There’s no one here”
>I ask her while I take the bikini top and tie it around my forearm
“Force of habit… now give me back my top”
>She offers her hand with her open palm facing up, fingers flexing forth and back
“I think I have the right to appreciate the goods after your little prank”
>I hold my chin and look down at the breasts still covered by her arms
>She huffs and turns her head to the side with her eyes closed
>A slight pink hue on her muzzle
>My grin softens at bit at the sight of her embarrassment
>She just looks so adorable like that
>I swim back to my surfing board and lay down on my back
>She soon follows, climbing onto the board, and laying down on top of me
>Her bare breasts squished against my chest
>She snakes her arms under my own and grabs my shoulders from behind, holding herself close to her
>She then rests her head and muzzle on the base of my neck and shoulders with a content sigh
>And I wrap my arms around her waist, holding her closer to me
>We lay there, basking on the sun’s heat and on each other’s presence until she speaks up
“How did you fell for such an obvious trick anyway?”
“I was still a bit sleepy when it happened”
>I start explaining to her, my hand caressing her back up and down
“Sleepy?”
>She pulls her head back to look at me, and the leans it to the side
“I took a nap while you went for a swim, I woke up with the sound of you rushing toward me, and I thought it was a shark”
>Her eyebrows raise up a bit before she starts giggling, and rests her head on the base of my neck again
“I’ll never let any Shark get near you, unless they’re looking for a beating”
>I hear her comment before snuggling me
>I can’t help but smile at that, it feels like I won the lottery when I met her, she’s perfect
>She’s funny and playful, but fiercely loyal and protective when necessary
>Is beyond beautiful, with her smooth skin, and blue eyes
>Strong, shapely legs, wide hips, and plump ass
>Toned abs and slim waist
>And soft, perky breasts
>And most important of all
>She loves to go surfing, just like me
>To ride on the waves and chill on the ocean
>Shit, I’m getting hard already
“Hmm, what do we have here?”
>And of course she noticed
>I flinch when I feel her hands sliding down my chest and into my surfing trunks
>She grabs my dick with her slender fingers and starts to massage it
>I can’t help but moan in response to her administration
>She smiles at me and starts stroking up and down
>Not to be outdone, I slide my hands down to her plump butt give them a good kneading, over and under her bikini panty
>The smooth skin almost makes my hands slip, but I still manage sink my fingers on her butt and give it a good massage
>She sighs in contentment while she continues to stroke my cock
>She then takes her hand off my trunks, and begins grinding her entrance against my erection, holding me closer than before
>She closes her eyes and bites her lower lips, and shivers when she feels my hands nearing the base of her tail
>With one hand on her left ass cheek, I move the other to the base of her thick dolphin tail and give it a good squeeze, making her squeal for me
>She pushes herself up from my neck and captures my lips, and I gladly return the kiss
>Our tongues quickly find themselves battling for dominance
>Sensing I was about to lose, I give her tail another squeeze, and when she flinches and moan, I shove my tongue inside her mouth
>I explore as much of the insides of her mouth as my smaller tongue allows me to
>But it seems enough to make her grind even faster against my erection
>She lets go of my lips and breathes heavily, a think string of saliva being the only evidence of our heated kiss
>She looks at me with glassy eyes, as her chest expands in sync with her labored breathing
“I… I can’t wait any longer”
>No more had to be said at the moment, everything was as clear as crystal
>I moved my hands down and pulled my trunks down just enough to free my erect cock from its fabric prison
>I can feel her entrance leaking through the fabric of her bikini 
>She wastes no time pulling her panties to the side, and allowing my dick to feel her hot, wet entrance
>I grab by cock and align it with her hot slit, but before I can do anything, she quickly slams herself down
“Ahhh!”
>While she moans loudly, I just barely hold myself from cumming right there
>Her tight pussy and muscles are already at work in squeezing and trying to milk my dick for all it’s worth
>I slap my hands on her ass, getting a yelp from her, and start slowly pulling her hips up and down
>The feeling of her walls massaging my hard cock was like heaven on earth
>I push her pussy away from my dick, and let her whine a little in need before slamming it down again
>Her sexy moans echoes in the air as I continue to fuck her pussy raw
>God damn it feels just as amazing as the first time we had sex
“Y-yes, just like that”
>She blurts out between her moans, her legs sliding down from the board and falling in the water
>She brings her hands up and holds my head in place before giving me another sloppy kiss
>Licking the insides of my mouth and my face
“Do- do it harder…”
>She stammers while giving me little kisses
>Doing as she requests, I move my hips and pull her’s in sync with my thrusts
“Ohhhhh shiiii-mmmm“
>She almost screams before biting her lower lip
>The meat slapping sounds of our lovemaking were so loud even a pornstar blush
>She collapses on my chest, a shivering mess as she buries her face on my shoulder
>Her lolling tongue and her hot breath lapping the sensitive skin of my neck  
>After holding as much as I could, I finally reach my limit
“I’mm gonna cummmm”
>She stammers out, her pussy muscles holding a firm grip on my cock as I slam it deeper and let out my white load inside of her, and ropes of my cum were milked by her needy cunt
>My dick slips out, and her pussy starts leaking cum onto by board, and washed by the water
>As my breathing started to calm down, I move my hands from her ass to her back, and hold her tight against me
>She’s still a quivering mess on top of me, but finds enough strength to hug me back, and snuggle me, with a satisfied smile on her face
>We stayed like for the duration of the evening
>That is
>Until a wave came and crashed down on us
