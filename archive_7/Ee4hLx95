>Be Anon (naturally)
>Have Lioness friend over. She is wearing a bodytight yoga outfit, her dreadlocked hair is tied up into a ponytail.
>She is teaching you Yoga
>You slip and land on your face, making her giggle a little.
>Correction, she is "trying" to teach you Yoga.
"Maybe we should take a break?"
>She calmly suggests
>Give an over exaggerated groan of agreement as you relax the rest of your body, near cartoonishly flopping onto the laminated floor and yoga mat.
>Sit up on floor and watch her navigate around your apartment with ease. She doesn't live here, but you've been friends for years and she even helped you move in.
"You know, this bottled ice tea doesn't last forever, and I know you're not the type to buy more of something healthy I got you."
>She appears from behind the fridge door, waggling a litre bottle of [named brand] ice tea with lemon and lime flavour.
>Smile sheepishly at getting caught abandoning it.
 "How about we have this to cool down, ye?"
>Agree, and pull yourself up off the floor to walk into the kitchen. She has sat down on one of your barstools, the other is pretty close to here as you sit down.
>Body starts to feel a little heated, and you hold back some spaghetti.
"Cheers!"
>You clink the small glasses of ice tea together, she knocks it back like a professional alcoholic, whereas you can barely sip at it.
>While she is distracted you wonder if she sees you as anything more than a yoga partner?
>Decide to knock back the tea to force some resolve, and gently put the glass down.
"See? not so bad, right?"
>She gives you that warm smile, just the thing you wanted to see
>Swallow down the spaghetti you could feel building
>Its now or never to confess your feelings. What could possibly go wrong?
