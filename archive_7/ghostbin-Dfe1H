"I'm sorry mistress, I'm sure I misheard you. Did you say I need to--"
>"Fuck me. Right now. Or I will die."
>you stare at your mistress and teacher in confused silence
>though you have to look her in the eyes as she is completely nude
>this has to be some sort of test, right?
>the older ferret woman had a fondness of teasing you
>needling you over potion ingredients
>or sweeping her tail against your skin to distract you while you were attempting a new spell
>that time she set a magical snare in her study, and let you hang up by your ankles while she watched you flail
"Mistress I don't--you're not really going to die are you? Are you playing another trick on me?"
>she sighs and grabs you by the collar to drag you through the door to her bed chamber
>it's surprisingly normal looking for a master mage's quarters, plainly adorned with sturdy furniture and a soft looking bed
>"I would not have summoned you here in the dead of night, and greeted you in naught but my furs if I were not deadly serious. I have gone into my heat--"
>she hisses the word, as though it were a curse
>"--and if ferrets do not have sex when they are in heat, they will die."
>you blink and nod slowly
>of course you had heard of beast folk going into heat, but the idea that it could kill them is a scary one
"Of course mistress. I will help however I can."
>she exhales in relief
>"Thank you, boy. I will take care of everything."
>with a flick of her hand, your clothes are suddenly gone, dissolving from your body in a flicker of light and appearing next to you, neatly folded
>you move to cover yourself as a reflex
>your mistress swats at your hand
>"Do as I say, boy. Let me see you, and do not avert your eyes from me. I want you to look at me."
>you do as she says, and finally break your gaze from her eyes
>her eyes that glow golden in the candle light
>she's slim and lithe, with immaculately groomed fur
>while she lacks the curves of other beast folks, she carries herself immaculately
>her tail flicks from side to side as she steps around you to observe you from every angle
>she holds her modest chest up proudly
>there's even a sway to her hips in each step that you normally didn't see when she walked you through her study
>and she stands a head taller than you, always peering down at you with those unfathomable eyes
>she takes her time as you inspect each other, but finally she comes to a stop in front of you once she's walked all the way around you
>she nods
>"You will do, Anon."
>that's probably a compliment
>she stares at you, looking like she's expecting something
>"Well? Am I acceptable to you?"
>it takes you a moment to think of the right words
"Mistress, I...have always thought you were beautiful. Wise and regal. Cold and untouchable like a precious stone."
>she had been completely stoic the whole night, but now she smiled warmly
>"Foolish boy. Perhaps after tonight I will not seem so cold. Come with me."
>the warmth is gone so suddenly, like it was never there at all
>she reaches out to take your hand, and marches you over to the bed, and directs you you sit back
>your mistress takes your cock and balls in one paw, seeming to appraise them as she did your whole body just a moment ago
>then she takes you by the shaft and starts stroking you vigorously
>you were already half erect when she laid you down, but the softness of her paw squeezing and stroking you gets you all the way there quickly
>"I am sorry, boy. I must take care of myself first."
>your mistress steps up and gently lowers herself into your lap
>"It will be rough. Hold onto me."
>you put your arms around her waist at her direction, and in turn she hugs you against her chest
>"Are you ready, boy?"
"Ye--Agh!"
>your mistress drops down on your prick in a sudden motion
>she's tight
>almost too tight!
>and so hot it burns
>you don't have the chance to protest, however, as she hugs you tight, muffling your voice against her fur
>her fur that's silky and soft
>your mistress clings to you desperately
>and pistons her hips up and down like a being possessed
>no words come from her, but a series of squeaks and moans that are quite unbecoming of a court mage
>you cannot find any amusement in it yet, you focus every fiber of your being on holding on to your mistress
>she does not let up
>she's actually getting faster
>and her squeaks have gotten louder
>it's uncharacteristically cute of your mentor to be so overwhelmed with physical sensation
>you would never have the temerity to say so, however
>her grip around you wrenches even tighter
>and her walls cling to your cock painfully
>you feel as though you're being strangled
>your mistress arches her back
>her pace does not let up
>even when she falls over forward and forces you back against the bed
>even when you struggle to get out from under her
>only when your vision swims and it feels as though you're going to lose consciousness does she finally slow down
>your mistress makes a last few truncated bucks of her hips
>she releases you, and rolls over to your side
>she still squeaks and huffs as she catches her breath
>and finally she leans over and kisses your cheek
>"Good boy~"
>your mistress stays close to you, giving you another kiss, then another
>"Good boy, such a good boy you deserve a reward..."
>you're still hard as diamond
>and she's noticed
>your mistress rolls onto her back, and sits up
>"Come here now, boy."
>you sit up, and she takes your shoulders, turning you to lay you on your back with your head in your lap
>she smiles down at you, the warmth returned to her visage
>one of her paws runs through your hair, while the other takes your member to start stroking it
>"You did so well for me, Anon. You don't know how happy you make me. Such a clever, diligent apprentice."
>your mistress praises you as she continues to jerk you off
>and she pampers you with her other paw
>playing with your hair
>cupping your cheek as she beams down at you
>and simply holding you while she works on getting you off
>she strokes you faster, and you leak pre onto her paw, staining her fur
>"I think you'll like this, Anon."
>she twists her hand, and your whole body starts to tingle
>invisible hands assault you
>they trace over your chest and massage your shoulders
>they even toy with your balls while your mistress paws you off
"Oooh gods..."
>you feel yourself melting into her lap
>"Good boy. Momma's good boy. Let go for me, Anon."
>you groan and thrust up into her hand with your climax
>your prick twitches in her hand, shooting your load over yourself and dribbling over her palm
>she keeps stroking your through your orgasm, whispering more praise
>even when she stops, she keeps calling you 'good boy', and her unseen hands continue to pamper you
"Thank you mistress..."
>your mistress suddenly glares
>"When we are doing this, you will call me Momma, understood?"
"Understood."
>she continues to glare
"Momma."
>she smiles again
"Good boy. I will send for some water and food and we can refresh ourselves. Make yourself comfortable."
>she stands, and the magic hands disappear at her gesture
>with another movement, and a small spoken incantation, her fur smooths over again, and from top to bottom she is washed clean
>though she leaves you covered in the remains of both of your climaxes
>you're content to lie in quiet while your mistress makes her arrangements
>with your mind finally free from the attention of your mistress, a thought occurs to you
>and you speak up when she returns with water and some simple cakes for you two to share
"Mis--Momma, if you needed to have sex when you're in heat, what did you do last year? And the year before that before I joined you?"
>she smiles, eyes glinting gold in the flickering light of the burnt-down candles at her bedside
>"Why I used a spell to suppress it of course. But I won't need that anymore with my clever boy taking care of me."
