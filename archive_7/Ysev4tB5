Beating the Heat -- Oliver_Hart

>You are Anon
>Professional street nigga
>Nah jk, you’re a college student and a bit of a dork
>It’s summer break, and as you get back from work, your roommate, Joey, drops a bomb on you
>”Anon, I hate to do this to you, but I’m moving out.”
>Wtf dude
“What? Why?”
>”I can’t afford to live here and go to school anymore. I’m moving in with my girlfriend so I can at least stay in school.”
>It’s shitty, but you can kinda understand. You’re busting your balls at work so you can at least eat
>Wait
“What about your half of the rent?”
>”Ah, no worry dude. I put an ad out a few days ago and found someone to sublease until my lease is up.”
“That’s great!”
>”Yeah, one more thing…”
>Joey gives a half smile
>”I know this probably won’t bother you, because you’re a cool guy, right?”
“No, but go on…”
>”Well uhhh, the person buying out my contract is a, uhhh…”
“You’re stalling…”
>”Is...a wolf?”
>You pause for a second
>A wolf, or more appropriately, an anthro would be living with you?
>At least for the summer
>There were plenty of them in town, a few even went to college with you
>Mostly humans and anthros didn’t interact much
>There used to be a lot of tension years ago, but it’s largely subsided
>To be honest, you have no strong opinion on them. After all, they were just like you, minus some obvious physiological and biological differences
>And the tails
>Now that you think about it, you kind of welcome the idea of living with someone a little “different.” Life is fairly routine for you and this could be a nice break
>”I’m sorry, I should have checked with you first. That doesn’t bother you, does it?”
>You laugh
“Naw dude, it’s cool, so long as his hair doesn’t clog up the shower or anything.”
>”Her hair.”
“Wat”
>”Yeahhh,” Joey nervously scratches at his neck
>”She was the only one who replied to my ad, and rent is due in a few days...and she offered to pay me upfront…”
>You do a double take
“So wait, my new roommate is a chick?”
>”That’s...that’s cool with you, right?”
>You sigh and think for a moment
>This is kind of bullshit, but you’re no animal fucker, so you guess it doesn’t bug you
>It’ll just be...an adjustment. Yeah. After all, you do need a roommate to help pay for rent
“I...I guess not?”
>He looks physically relieved
>”Thank you so much for being cool with all of this.”
“Yeah, sure, when does she move in?” 
>His hand anxiously returns to the back of his neck
>”Tomorrow?”
“WHAT.”
>”Look, I know this is all really sudden. It was kind of a spur of the moment thing for me too and I should have told you sooner.”
“You’re moving out that soon?”
>He nods his head, and shows you his room
>Your jaw drops
>It’s stripped completely bare
>You guess this is what he was doing while he was at work
>You turn to him and scowl
“I love you buddy, but you’re an asshole sometimes.”

>You roll over in bed as your eyes gently crack open
>Sunlight pours into your room
>You check your phone
>9:03 a.m.
>You toss the covers over your head, determined to get another hour of sleep on your day off
>And then you hear it
>It starts off with something faintly scratching at your door
>And then there’s other noises you slowly become aware of
>Muffled voices, doors opening and closing
>And the scratching at your door gets a little louder
>You grunt and throw yourself out of bed, popping on a robe, which you leave untied
>God damnit what the shit is that?
>You shuffle across the room, rubbing sleep from your eyes. The scratching sound gets louder
>Too tired to think, you pull open the door and look down
>A pair of bright green eyes beam back up at you
>Oh, it’s a little wolf pup
>Wait
>Quickly you tilt your head upward
>There’s at least six fully grown black wolves in the apartment, all staring at you
>Some are carting boxes, others furniture
>All motion has stopped, and you stare at the pack, bewildered 
>Wordlessly, a female wolf darts over from the kitchen and scoops up the pup at your feet, but not before she exchanges a confused glance with you
>She’s clearly much older than the rest of the wolves in the apartment, as evidenced by the  graying hairs around her muzzle
>Perhaps a mother
>You blink a few times
>What the fuck is going on
>And then the realization hits you like a baseball hits an outfielder at a little league game
>Hard, and in the face
>You throw your robe over your exposed body and hastily tie the sash, blushing beet red
“ImsorryIforgotyouweremovingintoday” you manage to blurt out
>The wolves are all still staring at you
>Did they not expect anyone to be living here or something?
>Or maybe they didn’t expect a human?
“So...My name is Anon, and I guess I...uhh..live...here.” You point to your bed
>.....
“Do you need any help?”
>.....
>”Anon?” A disembodied voice calls from your former roommates room
>A young she-wolf squeezes through the assembled crowd and quickly makes her way over to where you’re standing
>You study her for a quick second
>It’s a female, at least by what you can tell 
>She’s wearing a gray hoodie, jeans, and a beanie on her head
>All the  commotion in the room starts again, as if someone hit the play button
>”You must be Anon! Joey mentioned you.”
“I- uh, yeah, my name’s Anon. And you must be my new roommate…”
>You extend a hand out to her for a handshake
>After all, it’s only customary
>Her emerald green eyes quickly snap to your extended palm
>She stares at it for a few awkward seconds, as if not quite sure what to do
>She suddenly grabs a hold of your palm, squeezes WAY too hard, and shakes for a couple seconds, wearing an embarrassed smile
>”Claire. My name’s Claire.”
>When she finally lets go, it becomes apparent just how hard she was squeezing
>Handshakes must not be a thing with wolves
>”Sorry we woke you up. Joey said you’d be at work today…”
>Yep, that sounds like something he’d say
“No, it’s no big deal. I needed to get up anyway.”
>You survey the constant stream of wolves moving in and out of the unit
”You guys sure move fast,” you remark with a low whistle
>The other wolves all seem quite large and bulky, at least compared to Claire. Though you can’t help but notice that they all share her piercing green eyes
“Family I’m assuming?”
>Her face brightens a little
>“It’s not that obvious is it?”
“Whattt? Naww. I just assumed because the eyes.”
>She laughs a little 
>”Yep, thems my brothers.”
“Wait, did you say brothers?”
>”Yep, I was the lone bitch in a litter full of dicks, at least that’s what my mom likes to say.”
 >she shifts to lean against the wall
>”And yeah, they can be meatheads sometimes, but I still love ‘em.”
>Huh
>You’re an only child. You wonder what it’s like to have six other siblings
>Especially if they were all chicks
>You two chat for a little bit while Claire’s brothers help her move the rest of her stuff
>She’s a graphic design major going into her sophomore year
>You tell her you’re studying IT in, going in to your junior year
>You again extend an offer to help her move in, but she declines, stating that her brothers are almost done
>Which is true, because a few of them are sitting on your couch and chatting
>And someone is going through your fridge
>The whole place is kinda noisy
>And smells like...well, it’s not unpleasant, but it’s not a smell you’re used to. It’s kinda musky?
>She asks if she can introduce you to her family, and only after few seconds of contemplation do you realize that besides your robe, you’re only wearing boxers
>You excuse yourself to go get dressed
>You take a few seconds to throw on some dirty shorts and a t-shirt, mentally preparing yourself to meet a bunch of strangers who have suddenly invaded your home
>You gather yourself before you open the door
>Okay anon, you can do this. Big deep breath, and…
>You twist the knob and push open the door, wearing a painted on smile
>Your smile quickly evaporates
>Two of the larger male wolves are on the ground, locked in some kind of wrestling match, both playfully biting at each other
>Claire, your lifeline to surviving the next few minutes, is cracking up on the sidelines, her tail fanning back and forth 
>Jesus christ, why do you even bother leaving your room? Every time you do it sucks
>Your new roommate notices you standing in the door with a confused expression painted across your face
>Her eyes go wide with sudden panic
>And you swear you can almost see her blushing
>”DANNY! CONNER! KNOCK IT OFF!” She barks, her mood going from playful to demanding in a split second
>The pair quickly fall silent and untangle themselves
>They look like little kids who just got caught stealing from the cookie jar
>You think you even hear one of them whimper
>Claire shoots you an incredibly nervous smile
>After a short, awkward apology for her brothers ‘roughhousing’ in the living room, you finally get to meet her family
>You stumble through the greetings, but they all actually turn out to be pretty decent guys
>And apparently huggers too, which you find out pretty fast when their hugs engulf you
>A few of them are relatively your size, but the rest are a good three or four inches taller than you are, and much wider, with more bulk to them
>They must all be athletes or something
>One in particular, Ryan, hugs you especially tight, squeezing the air from your chest
 >He presses his face close up against yours
>”If you hurt my sister,” he whispers “I’ll bite your dick off.” 
>What did he mean by this?
>When he sets you down, he’s smiling and wagging his tail like he didn’t just threaten to take a huge bite out of your schlong
***
>Your autism thoroughly overloaded, you’re extremely relieved when her family finally leaves
>Which takes a while, because getting a whole family of wolves out a small door is apparently an issue worth fighting and snarling over
>Claire’s mother tries to keep order, but little can be done
>When the door finally shuts, you practically collapse onto the couch, exhausted
>It’s one thing to make nice with other humans, but a pack of wolves and some unspecific threats at 9:30 in the morning is something else entirely
>You need coffee 
>And food
>And a vacuum. The place is completely covered in hair
>You sigh
>This is your life now, you guess
>You’ll take care of that shit after getting breakfast
>You hope things with Claire aren’t always this crazy
>A quick check of your fridge reveals that while nothing is missing or opened, it’s all out of place
>You settle on coffee for now


>With coffee in hand, things start getting a little less foggy in your head
>As you’re setting out a list of breakfast foods you can eat, an idea begins to take shape
>Maybe Claire wants breakfast?
>After all, it’s pretty early, and you want to start things off right
>This morning was a little sudden and bumpy, but that’s not her fault, more Joey’s.
>You’ll give him a piece of your mind later
>You knock a few times on Claire’s door
“Hey, I’m making breakfast. Want me to make you some?”
>She cracks the door a little and snakes her head out
>”That sounds great actually! I’m just fixing things up in here. I’ll be out in a bit.”
>Cool
>You feel like a good person
>This is going to go well, just stay positive!
>You walk back to the kitchen and stand there, suddenly feeling very helpless
>It occurs to you that you have no idea if anthros have a specific diet
>You were going to make cereal
>Can she eat cereal?
>Will she be offended if you serve her cereal or something?
>Using your very expensive college education, you settle on bacon and eggs, which you’re sure is something she can stomach
>lmao everyone loves bacon and eggs
>And Claire is no exception
>She emerges from her room a minute later, carefully shutting the door behind her 
>She suddenly snaps to attention, nose twitching
>”Are you making bacon?”
“Yep, and eggs. It’ll be done in a few minutes. Just have a seat at the table.”
>She quickly pulls out a chair
>You can tell she’s trying very hard to contain her excitement as you set a plate of crackling bacon and cooked eggs before her
>You sit down with your own plate and another cup of coffee
>You half expected her to dive right in, mostly because you’re a presumptuous asshat
>But she doesn’t.
>Regardless of her apparent excitement, she takes small, controlled bites of her meal, keeping pace with you
>But you do catch her sneaking glances at you as you eat, her bites roughly matching yours
>Is she doing it on purpose?
>Actually, why are you making assumptions again? It’s probably just coincidence
>Jesus Christ Anon, control yourself
>You try your best to ignore it
***
>”Thanks for breakfast,” she says as she shoves the last forkful of eggs into her mouth
“No problem.”
>What a surprise, you both finished at about the same time
>you grab her plate and stack it on top of yours, making for the sink
>She leans back contentedly, adjusting the beanie on her head
>Yep, she absolutely looks like a graphic designer. 
>All she’s missing is some lip piercings 
>You kinda wanna see her portfolio, see if she’s any good
>”Hey Anon, can I ask you something?”
>You pause while scrubbing the dishes
>This usually never ends well, at least among humans
>Nonetheless, you decide to proceed with caution
“Sure, go ahead.”
>”So this morning, my family...They didn’t scare you, did they? Because I know we caught you off guard a little.”
>You think for a second, and one memory comes floating back quite vividly
>’I’ll bite your dick off.’
“Nah, just surprised me, that’s all,” which isn’t entirely a lie 
>Though the idle threat of getting your dick chomped is still a little worrying
“Actually, to be honest, I’ve never really ‘known’ an anthro, much less lived with one and met a whole family.”
>”Huh,” she leans on her elbows. “and living with one doesn’t bother you, does it?” 
“Nah,” you reply, stacking the dishes back in the cupboard. “Though I do need to vacuum. Also, I think your brothers messed up the fridge a little bit.”
>Claire smacks her forehead
>”Those assholes didn’t eat your food did they?”
“They didn’t eat anything, but it’d be okay if they did. I’m going to the store today anyway.”
>Her ears prick up a little
>“The store? What time?”
“Probably after I finish the dishes, so in a couple of minutes. Why?”
>”You think I could tag along? I kinda need to get some stuff too. I don’t really have any food…also I have no idea where the store is in this town.”
>Of course you have no problem with showing her around

>A few minutes later, with the dishes put away, you meet her by the front door
>When you see what she’s wearing you raise an eyebrow
“You’re still wearing a hoodie and jeans?”
>She gives you a confused look
>”What’s wrong with my clothes?”
“It’s the middle of July. And it’s like 90 degrees outside.”
>She playfully slugs your arm
>”Ah c’mon, I’m not afraid of a little heat. I’ll be fine.”
***
>”Jesus Christ it’s so hot,” she moans
>She directs the AC vents of your shitty little car directly at her and then slumps over
>You open your mouth
>”Don’t even say it.”
>Right then
>You keep your eyes fixed on the road
>The drive shouldn’t be too long. Maybe five minutes or so at worst
>You make it in relative silence, save for the soft drone of the radio
>After a while you come to a stop sign, and as you’re checking to make sure it’s safe to turn, out of the corner of your eye, you catch Claire hunched over, her face practically pressed against the AC vent
>Her tongue hangs from her mouth, and she almost look like she’s smiling
>Must be another wolf thing you don’t understand
>You decide not to say anything about it as you pull into the parking lot of your local Shop N’ Save
>The store is, as it usually is during the day, fairly slow
>The horrible in-store radio moans overhead as you guide Claire down the aisles
>She grabs a couple things off the shelves
>Shampoo and conditioner for her species, lots of snackfood
>And most importantly, several packages of ground beef
>She sheepishly clutches them to her chest, perhaps hoping you don’t notice
>You pretend not to

>When you arrive back at the apartment, she quickly tosses the ground beef into the freezer and slams a glass of water
>”Hoo, thanks again for letting me come along dude. I really appreciate it.”
”Yeah, no problem. If you need me to show you around town, just ask.”
>”Th-Thanks,” she says breathlessly
>She slouches against the counter and squeezes her eyes shut
“You okay?”
>”Y-Yeah, I’m fine. It’s just so friggin HOT.”
>She stands up and sways a little bit
>“I think I’m going to go change and lay down for awhile.” 
>You tell her that’s probably a good idea
>She’s crazy to be wearing such thick clothes in the middle of July
>Artsy types you guess 
>The overheated wolf retires to her room while you put things away
>You go to crank the AC a little and hang out in your own room
>It’s a little colder than you’re used to, but there’s nothing wrong with being a little accommodating now is there?

>You sit down to a peanut butter and jelly sandwich for dinner (and a beer because you’re a fucking adult)
>You bring the sandwich to your mouth, ready to take a bite
>You pause for a brief second and glance towards Claire’s room
>And then back to your sandwich
>You contemplate asking her if she wants something for dinner
>Should you offer?
>It’s not like you did this with Joey. Who cares what and when she eats? It’s not like you’re her dad
>....
>kinky

>You lightly rap a couple times on her door
“Hey Claire, I made dinner. You want some?”
>You wait a few seconds
>No response
>You shrug your shoulders and return to your meal
>At least you tried

>A couple hours later you’re back in the kitchen, spreading peanut butter across a slice of bread
>Being the poor cuck that you are, you’re getting your lunch ready for tomorrow
>Your gaze drifts towards your roommate's door
>Claire has been in her room since 11 this morning, and it’s now almost 9:30 at night
>You’re starting to get a little worried
>S-She’ll come out when she feels like it, right?
>....Did you say something to her?
>....
>Why do you care!? She’s an adult. You two are roommates. You barely even know each other at this point
>You look down to see your wrist coated in peanut butter
“God damnit…”

>You’re scrubbing peanut butter off your wrist in the sink when you hear Claire’s door creak open
>Your roommate shuffles into the living room
>She looks pretty wiped
>Her ears are drooped against her skull, eyes half open, body kind of limp
>She’s also shed her heavy clothes from before, now only dressed in a white tank-top and a pair of lime-green fitness shorts
>You can’t help but notice that she’s not wearing a bra either, though she seems out of it enough to where she might not have noticed either
>Her breasts aren’t massive, but they’re still a good size
>You just couldn’t tell earlier because of her massive hoodie
>And is that a nipple poking thr-
>”A-Anon?”
>She blinks a few times and yawns
>You quickly force your attention back on your wrist, which is still coated in peanut butter
>”I didn’t know you were still up,” she mutters as she stumbles into the kitchen
>You quietly sigh. She must have not noticed you eye-fucking her
“Well it’s only 9:30. I’m just getting lunch ready for tomorrow.”
>She shuffles past you and hums like she understands, though you’re not quite sure she actually does
“You feeling okay? You’ve been in there since this morning.”
>”I’m fine. Just hungry.”
>She pulls open your freezer and stares absently into the frozen wasteland, almost as if she forgot what her original intent was
>You cast a glance over your shoulder
>Almost instantly your eyes travel down her lower back and rest upon her ass
>The way she stands on her tiptoes to reach the freezer forces her round butt to strain against the surprisingly tight fabric of her fitness shorts
>*Scrubbing intensifies*
>She shuts the freezer door, having retrieved absolutely nothing
>Instead, she grabs her newly purchased bag of Cheeze Doodlez and walks slowly back to her room
>Almost as if she’s in a trance
>Because you’re a godless degenerate, your eyes trail her ass the whole way back until her door finally shuts
>You stare at her door a few seconds, water still splashing in the sink, arm aggressively cleansed of peanut butter
>This is going to be an interesting year
----------------------------------------
>The next few days you still don’t see Claire at all
>You wake up, go to work, come home, eat dinner and go to bed, all while her door remains closed
>The signs of her continued existence are few and far between
>Her shampoo and conditioner go unused
>The ground beef that she bought remains stacked in the freezer
>You only know she’s still alive by the bags of chips and Cheeze Doodlez that are slowly accumulating in the garbage
>She’s either active at night or while you’re at work
>Speaking of, you’re starting to wonder how she’s going to pay for rent, or what she’s going to do once she runs out of Cheeze Doodlez
>She obviously has no job
>...Or she does have a job that just requires her to be alone in her room all day and night
>...Like a camgirl…
>NO
>BAD ANON
>You shake the idea out of your head
>Though aside from the lewd thoughts, you are starting to get worried
>You figure that not seeing your new roommate for several days in a row is an appropriate thing to be worried over
>After all, the last time you saw her, she was acting really weird
>You decide that after work today, you’re going to go check on her
>And better yet, you devise a plan
>On your way home you stop and pick up a bucket of fried chicken
>Ordinarily you don’t eat this garbage, but this time it’s special
>Plus you’re almost out of peanut butter

>When you get home that evening, you head straight to your roommate's door
>You raise your hand to knock, but stop short
>You have a much better idea
>You lean in and put your ear against her door to scan for sounds of life 
>Anything to let you know she’s not dead
>Or that she’s even in there
>You listen for a few seconds
>There’s the hum of the air conditioner
>The shifting of ice cubes in your freezer
>But nothing else
>Does this make you look creepy?
>Well, you’re only creepy if you’re right
>You knock a couple of times, just a little louder than you usually would, in case she’s asleep
“Hey Claire, it’s been a couple days since I last saw you. Just wanted to make sure you’re okay in there.”
>You wait a few seconds and get no response
>Alright Anon, time to bring out the big guns
“I brought home dinner. Just wanted to know if you wanted any.”
>....
“It’s fried chicken…”
>Okay, now you’re starting to sound a little crazy 
>And also kinda offensive
>Well, why stop now?
“Listen, I just wanna make sure you’re okay, so just say something, or make a noise, or…”
>....
>God damnit you’ve had enough of this
>You give the knob a small twist only to find that she’s locked the door
>You stop before you give it another try
>You’re not about to start pounding on her door
>Plus that was definitely a little over the line
>You retreat from her door, slightly ashamed of yourself 
“What the hell were you thinking dude? That was creepy as hell.”
>You set the bucket of fried chicken in the fridge, defeated
>Shit, you’re not even hungry
>You gambled on stereotypes and then on your general awkwardness, and none of them paid off (as usual)
>Good going, asshat. If she’s in there she heard everything, and she probably thinks you’re out of your mind
>You don’t blame her for locking her door

>That night your head hits the pillows a earlier than usual
>You don’t know what else to do
>You tried baiting her, but that didn’t work
>And then you actually tried forcing your way into her room, and that didn’t work and just made you look creepy
>To say that you feel kind of disgusted and ashamed about this whole night is an understatement
>But there’s one more thing that you feel besides guilt and shame
>Concern
>And just before you drift off to sleep, one last thought crosses your mind
“Dude, what if she killed herself?”

>What you find in the morning completely shatters your delusions
>The entire bucket of chicken is in the trash
>Each and every piece of chicken has been picked down to the bone
>Some of the bones even have teeth marks
>Strangely enough, the sight of the carnage puts you at ease
>She’s still alive
>Actually, shouldn’t you be even more concerned now?
>That was a LOT of fucking chicken
>No human or anthro ought to eat that much fried chicken in one night
>It just ain’t natural
>Then again, she’s been subsisting entirely off of Cheeze Doodlez for a couple days straight, she was probably pretty hungry for something more substantial
>But you can’t just keep buying her food, that’s complete bullshit and is totally
>She’ll be out of Cheeze Doodlez soon, it’s only a matter of time before she makes waste of your peanut butter and jelly
>A-And all the other food you eat h-haha
>You grab a pen and a piece of paper and set about making an inventory of all the food that is yours
>You’re going to KNOW when she steals your food
>You resolve to make an issue about it once she starts eating your stuff
>Until then, you’re just going to let sleeping dogs lie (heh)
>Once you reach the end of the list, you can’t imagine why she’d ever want to eat anything of yours
>All you really have left is stuff to make peanut butter and jelly, cereal, and beer
>You make a mental note to hit the store on your way back from work today

>A couple more days of silence between you two pass
>You do your best not to think about your awkward roommate situation, going about your business as usual
>Signs that she’s growing increasingly desperate begin appearing
>For instance, with her Cheeze Doodlez depleted, she’s already gone through a whole tray of ground beef
>You REALLY hope she bothered to cook it, but you’re not sure if wolves can eat raw meat
>One day as you leave for work, you decide to turn off the AC just to see what would happen
>When you return home, you find that it’s been set back 
>Well, at least you know she’s leaving her room when you’re gone
>But honestly, this is just getting ridiculous
>You might have believed that she was nocturnal or something, but now you’ve got proof that she’s up during the day
>It just feels like she’s purposefully ignoring you now
>What the hell did you even do to her?! You’ve been nothing but accommodating and kind since she got here?
>And to make shit worse, you think you’re starting to lose your goddamn mind
>When you got home from work today, you went to change into some comfy clothes, which also happen be in the laundry, and couldn’t find your sleeping shirt
>You know...the one that you got in New Mexico on that family road trip that shamefully still fits your twigish figure?
>...The one from Roswell which says ‘I was probed and all I got was this lousy t-shirt’?
>Yeah. There’s a reason it’s a sleeping shirt and not a ‘wear-in-public’ shirt
>This fucking sucks
>You sit on the edge of your bed and whip out your phone
>You consider calling Joey and begging him to come back
>Hell, he can even bring his girlfriend over with him too
>Shit was NEVER this weird when he was still living with you
>You tap out the message but end up deleting it
>He won’t come back. Why would he, when he can be with his girlfriend all day?
>You roll over in your bed and groan
>You’ve turned into *that guy*
>The guy who goes to work or class, comes home, and has absolutely nobody else in his life
>Even your own roommate is avoiding you

>That night is particularly unbearable
>Something’s wrong with the AC, probably that you’ve been running it for a week straight
>You toss and turn in bed, drenched in your own sweat
>After considerable struggle You at last drift off to a restless sleep

>In the morning you drag your desk fan out of the closet and set it up in your room
>You shut the door to your room before taking off for work, hoping to trap as much cool air in your bedroom as you can 
>Before you head out the front door, you take a look at Claire’s room
>You wonder how she’s coping without the AC
>Well, sucks for her. If she wants to do something about it, she can come out of her room and help you deal with it
>Until then, you’ll survive on your little fan and general pettiness
>On your drive to work, you can’t help but wonder if you’re a little angry at her
>Yeah
>Just a little bit

>You get off work a LOT later than you’re used to
>By the time you get home it’s practically dark outside
>The streetlights are even on
>And when you open the door to your apartment, you immediately gasp for air
>Jesus Christ it’s fucking SWELTERING in here
>It’s like the whole place has been incubating
>Even setting your bag down on the kitchen table makes you feel sticky and gross
>And guess who’s door is still shut?
>Psh, she can fucking roast in there for all you care
>You do a quick check of the kitchen, secretly hoping that you’re missing some food so you can go off on her
>Nothing of yours is missing, but she did go through another package of beef
>Christ she might actually be eating it raw, it doesn’t look like she’s been using any of the cookware
>You’re a little disappointed that you don’t have a good reason to explode at her
>Gah, you’re just stressed out from work and this roommate situation. You remind yourself that she’s not a bad person
>A little dinner will help you chill out

>After a beer and a sandwich, you’re feeling a little more relaxed, but your clothes are fucking sticking to you, which is gross
>You head to your room to go change, and to your surprise, your door pushes open
>Didn’t you have this shut before you left for work?
>It’s almost like someone opened it and didn’t do a good enough job shutting it on their way out
>Whatever, maybe you didn’t shut it all the way before work
>You step inside and flick on your bedroom lights
>Everything looks as you left it
>Except your bed
>Every morning you make your bed like a good little cuck, and while it’s not messed up, your autistic spidey-senses can see the impressions left by a foreign body
>Not to mention that the desk fan which faces your bed is on its highest setting
>You always leave it on medium

>Slowly you put things together in your head
>The missing shirt
>The messed up bed
>The fan
>You glance over your shoulder and across the living room, where a plain white door remains shut and locked
>Her
>She’s been in your room, on your bed, and likely, in your laundry
>God knows why, but you do know one thing:
>You’re done with this shit
>You’re about to go bang on her door, but when you finally get across the living room, you can’t bring yourself to do it
>You’re not the confrontational type at all and you don’t have to balls to go through with it
>You clutch your head 
“God damnit…” You seethe
>You just want your shirt back and old roommate back
>Instead of doing something about it, you return to your room to sulk
>What’s another night without your favorite shirt? That fucking thing was dirty anyway
>With nothing else to do, you lay down in your bed
>Your filthy, defiled bed
>You can almost feel her weight next to you
>The subtle impressions she makes in your mattress
>You shut your eyes and listen to the soft noise of the fan
>Feel the cool air rolling across your sweaty body
>Maybe you can understand why she’d want to sit on your bed
>It feels good
>In the haze of your mind, with sleep weighing in on all sides, you want to tell her that it’d be okay with you if she hung out in your room
>If only you could tell her

>You throw your head up off the pillow and gasp
>Jesus you can’t breathe, it’s so goddamn hot in here
>You glance around your room
>There’s only a little light coming in from the window by your bed, but other than that, the place is dark
>Instinctively, you check your phone, squinting as the light hits your eyes
>2:20 a.m.
>You must have dozed off, because you’re still wearing your work clothes
>You carefully shuck your slacks and dress shirt, which is easier said than done,
>God damn you need to do laundry soon
>You also REALLY need a glass of water, because this heat is killing you

>You stumble into the kitchen, your eyes barely open, and pound a few glasses of water
>Feeling full and slightly less delirious, you make for your room
>But something stops you in your tracks
>There’s a faint stripe of yellow light beneath the bathroom door
>You stare dumbly at it for a few seconds until the hiss of the shower snaps you back to reality 
>Holy shit, she’s in there
>She’s taking a shower
>You don’t think about what you do next 
>In fact, it doesn’t even feel like you’re the one doing it. More like you’re watching some impulsive dumbass controlling your body
>You power walk towards Claire’s room
>Time is of the essence

>With the momentary jolt of adrenaline out of your system, you’re starting to have second thoughts
>Is this right? Should you be doing this?
>....
>Fuck yes it is, she has your shirt
>Also you’ve always wondered what her room looks like
>You twist the knob and feel it give
>You let out a nervously held breath
>It’s not like she could lock herself out of her own room, but you still remember trying to get in the first time
>When you step inside, the stench hits you almost instantly
>Jesus CHRIST it’s strong in here
>It smells dirty and musky and sweaty
>You thought /your/ room was bad? This is a whole new level of dank
>You have no idea how she can stay in here all day and night marinating in this stuff
>It’s also pitch fucking black, like she’s got trash bags taped over the window
>Oh my god, what if she does? Isn’t that what crazy schizos do?
>Your hand fumbles around for the light switch
>The lightbulb overhead fizzles for a second, and then at last comes on
>You squeeze your eyes shut and slowly open them as you adjust to the light
>....
>Her room is...huh
>You expected it to be a complete disaster, but it’s not
>It’s actually kind of...bare
>She has a crappy old dresser in one corner of the room
>And you guess in the other corner of room, that pile of mixed blankets is where she sleeps
>There’s no mattress, no nothing
>It’s just a pile of blankets, arranged to look a little like a nest
>And there’s no trash bags taped over the window, the curtains are just shut
>Her laptop is sitting in the center of her room with a drawing tablet plugged in
>There’s also a sketchbook nearby, and some balled up wads of paper
>You can see a dark green piece of clothing in front of her laptop 
>You squint
>Yep, that’s your shirt New Mexico shirt


>As quietly as you can, you tiptoe across the carpet, which is relatively clean, aside from some stray pieces of clothing and some paper scraps
>You bend down to pick up your shirt, but your eyes wander over to a stack of books nestled against her dresser 
>Curious, you scurry over
>You didn’t think she was a reader
>But then again, you’ve had all of ~1 day to get to know her
>You heft the first weighty tome and silently read the title
”Figure Drawing in Proportion: A Practical Guide”
>That seems like something an artist would have. It’s a fairly innocuous book.
>You go to set it down back on the pile, but stop as your eyes catch the name of the next title
”Drawing Human Anatomy”
>You pick it up and flip through it
>It’s another pretty standard drawing book with some expertly drawn human figures
>Undeterred by your relatively benign findings, you check the title of the next book
“Human Anatomy for Artists”
>Man, there’s a strange amount of books on drawing humans in here
>That’s not all she has, right?

”Human Art of the Renaissance”
”The Human Figure”
”Anatomy 101”
”Drawing the Nude - Human Edition”
The last book in the stack isn’t even a drawing book
”Carrying Thunder by Jamie Redding”
>On the cover, there’s a nude doe being held against the muscled chest of a shirtless human
>With his free hand, the human aims the tip of a cutlass towards a group of surly looking pirates and buccaneers
>You flip it over to read the back
>”Women, much less anthro women like her, weren’t allowed aboard Captain William Sully’s ship. To escape her life of poverty, Thunder Sterns dons a new name -- Robert Demaus -- and enlists under the handsome and bombastic captain. But as the seas turn red at the hands of the legendary pirate Norgar, can Thunder keep her identity, and her true feelings, a secret?”
>Your hands start to shake
>This is starting to get REALLY weird
>Is it this room? Is it the stench of sweat and musk that’s getting to you and making you like this?
>You stack the books back as quickly as possible and go to grab your shirt
>You’ve done enough snooping your roommates private life for an eternity

>In a rush to get out of this sweatlodge of a room, your feet find her sketchbook and you slip forward, crashing down on your face
>God damnit, that was really smooth
>You pick up the sketchbook and go to set it back next to her laptop, but Instead of setting it down, however, you stare at the front cover with morbid curiosity
>Do you dare?
>....
>Well, you’ve come this far, you nosey son of a bitch

>The first few pages are actually pretty...tasteful
>It’s mostly just human figures, faceless and featureless, in various poses
>Most of which are are actually pretty good
>When you turn the next page, you feel a blush scour your cheeks
>There’s anthro women getting fucked all over this page
>And these aren’t just doodles either, these are full blown sketches, some of them she even tried coloring in with varying degrees of success
>The further you go, the raunchier it gets
>Vaginal, oral, anal, creampies, threesomes, origies, rimjobs, women dripping with cum, women tied up, men in bondage-
>Oh, and it looks like she’s taken a few pages to perfect her cock drawing technique; All of them human
>You throw the sketchbook down
“Okay, time to go.”
>You scurry out of her room, killing the lights and shutting the door behind you
>You feel so...dirty, having seen the smut that she reads and all the porn that she draws
>It’s like going through some girl’s underwear drawer and finding a g-string
>Though you also feel a little turned on too
>It’s been wayyy too long since you had a good fap, if the growing heat in your groin wasn’t evidence enough
>You always feel like you can never have any privacy when she’s around
>Which is always

>You’re halfway across the living room when you hear a faint and shaky voice behind you
>“A-Anon?”
>It practically gives you a heart attack
>God damnit, how could you have not heard her get out of the shower?
>Stupid stupid stupid stupid
>Slowly you turn around
“Claire?”
>You see her standing there in the weak moonlight, having just stepped out of the bathroom, holding a damp towel
>She’s barely dressed wearing a dirty, ill-fitting tank top and a pair of light blue panties that accentuate her gentle curves
>You two stare at each other for what feels like ages, frozen in shock
>It’s kind of like seeing a ghost, considering neither of you have seen each other in more than a week
>A ghost with shimmering green eyes
>A ghost with nice, hand filling tits, and plump thighs
>A ghost who’s blush was so red and fierce you could see it in the dark
>Why is she blushi-
>You glance down
>Oh
>That’s right
>You’re not wearing anything but your boxers
>And she probably sees that you found the shirt that she stole from you

>”I d-didn’t- I didn’t k-know you were still up...”
“Yeah, I didn’t know you were up either. Sorry if I woke you or anything.”
>She simply stares at you, her bright green eyes transfixed on your own
>Maybe it’s been awhile since you’ve seen her face, but you swear that her eyes look different somehow. Her once rounded pupils have narrowed into predatory slits
>You try to play down your nerves, but the fluttering in your chest is a dead giveaway: Something ain’t right
>She takes a slow step towards you
>”N-No, you didn’t wake me up at all. I’ve been u-u-up for the past couple days a-actually h-heh.”
>Did she just say ‘the past couple of days’?
“Jesus Christ, why haven’t you been sleeping Claire?”
>She takes another step forward
>”It’s just so *hot*, I c-can’t sleep. I can’t sleep in my r-room, I can’t sleep out here, I c-can’t sleep a-a-anywhere.”
>Okay now something DEFINITELY doesn’t feel right about this
“Are you feeling alright? You’ve been acting weird for the past couple of days.”
>As she gets closer, you notice that she’s heavily salivating, threads of saliva dripping off her broad, pink tongue
>You take a small step back, putting your hands up defensively
“Do I need to take you to the hospital or something?”
>She’s getting closer
>You feel like your heart is about to explode out of your chest
“Claire…?”
>Oh god, this is how you die. Just like that scene in The Shining
>You’re going to be mauled to death by a psychotic wolf chick. She’s probably going to feast upon your corpse like in some black metal music video
>But you have so much to live for!
>....
>Okay, well, you still don’t wanna die
>Fuck, you’d give anything for a baseball bat right now


>You hastily look around the room, eyes settling on a cup of water you left on the kitchen counter
>...fuck...
>It’s no baseball bat, but it’s your only shot
>You hastily swipe it off the counter, cock back your arm, take aim, and…
>You feel the cup slip from your grasp as your body extends forward into your throw
>You hold your breath as a shimmering curtain of water splashes across her face...
>...Followed by the cup, which bounces harmlessly off her skull (god damn plastic)
>Welp, you tried
>All that’s left to do now is pray that whatever supreme being is out there doesn’t hold it against you for the porn you occasionally get off to
>You squeeze your eyes shut tightly, hoping that she tears your throat out first so it’s quick
>A few seconds of absolute silence pass
>And then a few more
>You don’t feel your throat being ripped out
>You open your eyes and see that she’s stopped dead in her tracks
>She blinks a few times, water dripping off her face
>”A-Anon?”
>She slowly scans the room with her once predatory eyes, now restored to their original softness
>”Anon? What’s happening?”
>She puts a hand to her head
>”And why am I so dizzy?”
>You watch, petrified, as she lightly sways back and forth
>Her knees buckle, and she collapses in a heap

>You scramble to her side
>Only once you’ve got her head propped up on your knee do you realize how stupid this was
>She could claw your face off at any moment
>It could be bait, and you walked right into it
>WHY DID YOU WALK RIGHT INTO IT
>The truth is, the minute you saw her faint, you panicked more than when she was sizing you up for a meal
>Well, there’s no going back now. You’re a dead man
>But as you place your palm against her forehead, feeling the wetness trapped in her dark fur, you get the feeling that she’s not pretending
>Actually, she’s burning up!
“Oh shit, this is bad…” 
>You contemplate running to your room and calling an ambulance, but you’re worried she’s going to die if you leave her side
>What the fuck do you do!?
>Is she still breathing? 
>You can’t tell! It’s so goddamn dark in here!
>You want to drag her into the light, but you’re scared of moving her
>Okay, stay calm, Anon. Panicked people get other people killed. Staying calm keeps people alive
>But you have a hard time staying calm, if the way your heart hammers against your ribcage is any indication
>You don’t know how, but you probably just killed your new roommate
>They need to ban plastic assault cups
>You’re sorry you got mad at her, you’re sorry that you didn’t trust her, you’re sorry that you wanted her gone, you’re sorry that you snuck into her room, you’re sorry that you threw that cup at her
“I’m sorry about everything…” you whisper into the dark
>And the darkness whispers back
>”Anon…?”

>Claire’s eyes gently flutter open
>You’ve never been so happy to look someone in the eyes before
>Slowly, she props herself up, shivering with every tender movement 
>You try to say something, but the words simply die in your throat
>”What just happened? Where am I?”
>Her eyes fall to your exposed chest
>”Why don’t you have a shirt on?” She whispers, a little louder than she probably meant to 
>You can’t contain yourself any longer
>You lean in-
>”A-Anon, wait-”
>-And throw your arms around her neck, pulling her in tight for a hug
“I thought you were going to die,” you blubber
>You can feel her shiver once, and then go limp, allowing her muzzle to rest on your shoulder
“And I thought I killed you!”
>”W-What?” 
>She quickly goes stiff again and pulls her body away from you
>”Dude what happened?”
>You lean back and give her a confused look
“You don’t remember anything that happened in the last 10 minutes?”
>”N-No! All I remember is going to the bathroom to take a cold shower. After I got out everything else is a blur.”
>Oh shit, is she for real? 
>Does she really not remember anything?
>Do you tell her to forget about everything that just happened? Do you tell her how she was going to eat you? How do you explain why her face is wet, and why her tanktop is soaked, and why you’ve been perving looks at her protruding nipples ever since you found out she wasn’t dead?
>...Okay, you were still doing it even when you thought she was dead
>Still, whatever you do, you better tread carefully
“Well, when you tried to kill me-”
>As careful as a bull in a China shop
“-I splashed some water on your face and hit you with a cup. Then you just…passed out, I guess?”

>”I tried to KILL you?” She gasps
“Yeah! Well, you were walking towards me with this really weird look in your eyes. They were like little slits, and you were slobbering all over yourself. I think you wanted to eat me and-”
>She shuts her eyes as a blush scours her face
>”Oh...*that*...” she mutters
“Wait, what does ‘*that*’ mean?”
>She shyly glances towards the window, where the moonlight is still pouring in
>”I-I don’t think I was trying to eat you, Anon…”
“N-Nani?!”
>”What?”
“Sorry, go on.”
>You fold your arms across your chest 
>She doesn’t speak for several seconds, and when she finally does, it’s so quiet you can barely hear her
>”I guess I owe you an explanation. I didn’t plan on this happening, at least so soon…”
>When she turns to look at you, you can plainly see how red she is, either from the heat of the apartment or something else
>”I think I was trying to….Goddamnit….I think I was trying to mate with you.”
>Oh
>That must be the something else

>Wait
>WHAT
“When you say mate, you mean like, have babies with me?”
>She quickly throws her hands around her ears and twists them
>”Gah! No! I mean yes! I mean-”
“I didn’t think humans and anthros could have children together,” you add rather dumbly
>”No! They can’t! But my body doesn’t know that…”
>She folds her ears so they cover her eyes
>”Every year I go into heat, and my body tells me that I need to mate. This year it came way sooner than it should have, and I forgot my medicine at home.”
>You blink a few times, because it’s still not getting through
“Wait, if you didn’t bring any medicine, why didn’t you come and tell me to get some for you? I could have helped.”
>She sighs heavily
>”Because I was afraid of something exactly like this happening. It’s never been this bad before, not in my entire *life.* I didn’t know what else to do... I got scared, so I just shut myself up in my room and tried to ‘take care of it’ on my own, and we all know how well that’s been working. I Can’t leave the room, can’t go outside because I’m afraid of what I’d do if I left the building...and with AC going out and everything, I’ve been dying.”
>You open your mouth to ask about all the food she ate, but you stop yourself
>She looks so...defeated.
>Her knees are tight against her chest, her eyes fixed on anything but your own
>She’s been suffering in silence for so long, and now she probably thinks she’s some kind of rape-monster
>You get a brilliant idea, one that will make her more comfortable with her actions
“Here, you can keep this,” you say as you toss your shirt towards her
>It lands in a crumpled pile
>When she picks it up to examine it, her face twists into a horrified expression
>”O-Oh! I see you found the shirt! I-I’ve been meaning to return this!
>”MY BROTHERS M-MUST HAVE PUT IT IN MY ROOM DURING MOVE IN!”
>”Y-YOU KNOW, LIKE A PRANK H-HAHA!”
>She tries valiantly to force a smile, but the strain and the horrendous blush playing out across her face only makes it look like she’s constipated.
>Having convinced nobody, not even herself, she shrinks even further into despair
>”Goddamnit, who am I kidding? I’m a creep, I know.”

“No, you’re not,” you scoot up next to her
>She doesn’t bother lifting her head up from the shelter that is her knees to acknowledge your presence
“Well, maybe the drawings were a little creepy, but-”
>Her ears prick up
>That's a good way of getting her attention
>“You saw the drawings?”
>You nod your head a few times
>You're about to start complimenting them, but she practically has a seizure
>”They’re not what you think, I promise!” She squeaks as her hands return to her ears, giving them a tight crank
>You wanted to help, but you think you’re only making things worse
>Still, you do want to know what she means by that 
“So what are they?”
>She quickly buries her head back into her knees and mumbles something
>”Mpffhh hmmm I mmmm frrr rmmmm.”
“What?”
>”I said: ‘They’re how I pay for rent.’ people online pay me to draw...that stuff…and I draw it.”
>You let out a big belly laugh, which scares the shit out of Claire
“Oh thank God, I thought that you were drawing out your fantasies or something.”
>”O-Of course not!”
>Sighing, you lean back on your palms and stare out the window, up towards the moon
“Those were pretty good too. You’ve got a lot of talent, you know?”
>”Gee, thanks,” she says with an air of sarcasm
>”I’m glad that you approve of me basically whoring myself out through art.”
>You try to get a word in, telling her you thought they were kinda hot, but she cuts you off with a low whimper
>”I can’t stand this anymore! It’s so fucking hot in here. I can’t tell if it’s this apartment or my body anymore.”
>Her tongue flops out of her mouth and she begins panting loudly
>You try not to stare, but it’s clear she doesn’t care if you notice her quirks anymore
>You've pretty much seen it all by this point

>Still, you wanna do something to help. You feel like this whole debacle is your fault
“You...You probably already know this, but there’s a fan in my room. You wanna go cool off?”
>She slumps back against the floor
>”Thanks, but I don’t think I’ll make it over there. I feel like the whole room is spinning.”
“C’mon,” you stand over her and extend a hand
“I thought you weren’t afraid of a little heat?”
>For the first time this night, you see a genuine smile on her face
>She grasps your hand, and you pull her up
>Her shaking legs can’t sustain her for very long, and pretty soon you’re holding dead weight
>It’s clear she’s not going to make it to your room on her own
>So you do what you must
>You duck in low, throwing her arm around her shoulder
>It’s time
>You plant your feet, arch your back
>You can feel the spirit of Zyzz and Scooby watching over you
>”A-Anon?”
>Glutes-
>You grunt and strain to suppress a fart
>-For the sloots
>You rise upward with Claire limply hanging off of you
>The heat sapping your skelly strength, you hobble towards your room
>Claire does her best to try and help, but there's not much she can do
>You drag her and you down the short hall to your room, but with her limp weight and the claustrophobic heat of the apartment, it's more like you're dragging a dead deer up hill in a sauna
>At last at your room, you kick open your door, and with a contained grunt, you toss her onto the bed
>She lands on her back with a soft *pomf*, all splayed out with one arm crooked above her head
>Exhausted, you brace yourself against your dresser, fighting off a dizzy spell
>When you finally regain strength enough to stand, you glance over to her
>She’s panting again, her face flushed with blood and heat
>Her eyes lock with yours, needy and wanting
>”S-Sorry, It’s this room,” She mutters, her breaths coming in short gasps
>She quickly looks away
>”I can’t help myself in here. It smells so strong...”
>Unconsciously, she rubs and twists her thighs together
>HNNNG
>It’s just like one of your Chinese cartoons

“F-Feel better?” you gasp, sucking in some humid air
>You're just trying to be polite and professional, but she's very obviously not feeling any better
>If anything she's doing worse. Look at her you fucking beta
>She’s a horny mess, squirming around on your bed because she physically can’t control herself
>”I can’t even t-think straight right now,” she moans. “M-Maybe you should c-call a doctor…”
>Fuck doctors, you dragged her into this sweaty room. You’re gonna take responsibility for this one, right?
>Summoning from the shallow wells of your courage, you take a deep breath and lay down next to her on the bed
>You can physically feel the heat radiating off of her
>She’s got it BAD. You either do this or you cuck yourself and let some Chad doctor do it for you
>Well, here goes nothing
“Claire...Would it help if I...you know...If we…”
>You don’t get an answer
>You get a tongue in your mouth

>She fumbles about in your mouth, her tongue desperately crossing and tangling with your own
>Caught off guard, your eyes go wide
>You relax as you let things settle, and soon you begin to go back and forth with her
>For several moments, all that can be heard between the two of you is the steady drone of the desk fan
>Your tongues twist and turn against one another, feeling the softness of each other, the dampness of your combined lust
>She’s not aggressive, nor domineering, but you can feel the desperation in the way she presses herself deeper into your mouth, pining for more and more of you
>You do some fighting back with your own tongue and push back a little more aggressively which earns a satisfied, yet contained moan from your roommate as she yields 
>As you kiss, your hand slowly travels from down from her cheeks, over the coarse fabric of her top, and down to her chest
>Your palms gently roam over her breasts, causing her to break the kiss
>With eyes squeezed tight, she softly groans and arches her back into the air
>You take that as a signal to keep doing that, which only earns you another sultry moan as your fingers sink into her pliable flesh

>She wastes no time in shucking her sweat-stained tank top, and tossing it hard into the dark abyss of your bedroom
>You sit up, and by the grace of the soft moonlight you at last get to see her tits
>As you suspected, they’re well rounded and substantial enough to jiggle slightly as her chest heaves with anticipation
>Though her fur is dark, the pinks of her nipples stand out like tiny pillars of pleasure
>You grab a hold of one and give it a light squeeze
>Her entire body tenses and her hands twist into bedsheets
>”F-Fuck…” she whimpers
>Tiny bolts of pleasure coarse through her sensitive nubs as you gently squeeze, pull and twist on them
>Watching her tense up and tremble at your every touch gives you a naughty idea
>You roll over on top of her 
>Comfortably seated on her stomach, you crack a devilish grin
>Both of your hands shoot out to find her sensitive breasts, but your mouth has a different target as you lean over her
>You quickly lock tongues, stifling her exasperated gasps as your fingers play at her body
>Unprepared for your sudden advance, you find that this time she’s not as resilient in matching your pace
>Nonetheless, you press onward, each twist and subtle pull of her stiff nipples winning you a long, stifled moan, driving her further and further into her desire
>You break the kiss for air, and watch, almost sadistically, how she squirms beneath your weight
>Her fevered gaze travels downward from your face, to your chest and then to your crotch
>She locks her focus on your cock, which is already straining against the thin fabric of your underwear, dampening it with pre

>She quickly looks up into your eyes and gives a small, begging whine
>Oh man, this is just too cute
>You look over your shoulder to see her twisting and rubbing her thighs together
>The poor girl needs cock like a fish needs water
>Well, she’s going to have to earn it firs-
>Her hands shoot up and attach themselves to your shoulders
>She rolls you onto your back before you can even finish your thought
>You didn’t think that she had this kind of strength
>The powers of cocklust are not to be trifled with
>Without hesitation, she rakes down your boxers like an animal tearing away at her fresh kill 
>Your cock springs free just as her tongue drops out of her mouth
>You can’t help but hear how loud she’s sniffing the air right now
>Must be some kind of scent/pheromone thing
>Whatever
>She drags a waterfall of hot saliva down onto your shaft
>She is literally drooling over your cock right now
>You tell yourself that it’s because of you and not her heat, but a tiny part of you hopes she’s still in there somewhere
>With one hand she pushes your dick against your stomach for easier access to your balls
>Her tongue coats your sack in a thick film of spit as she laps at your tender, aching nuts
>She inhales deeply, trembling with each breath as she worships you 
>You groan as her tongue starts working its way from your sack, to the base of your cock
>Gripping your member with both hands, she slowly drags her tongue up your shaft as she manages to squeeze out a thick dollop drop of precum, which trickles down towards her waiting tongue 
>She greedily slurps it up as if it were a gift from the gods
>You look into her eyes and see the hunger behind them
>Somehow though, she restrains herself, taking her sweet time by running her tongue up and down your shaft like she was licking a popsicle, milking as much of your precum as she can out of your cock and onto your tongue
>You just about blow your load when she hungrily wraps her lips around the tip of dick and brings you into her mouth
>It’s...been awhile since you’ve had a blowjob
>But this ain’t nothing like the blowjobs you got before

>At first she gently pulls back and forth, adjusting her cheeks and her suction force so as not to bite you
>You’d be lying if you said you weren’t a little afraid of her chompers
>This carries while you moan and fidget gently, straining to not rudely force yourself down her throat
>Every stroke of her tongue against your tender cock feels like a thousand little orgasms
>It’s broad and long enough to reach the base of your cock as she gently works you in and out of her mouth
>Her cheeks slowly wrap around your dick, and you can feel the sheer heat of her feverish body squeezing around you
>With a small gag on her part, your cock slips down the back of her throat
>She holds it there for a second, letting her tongue caress and base your dick
>She then pulls up, dragging a shimmering trail of spit along the length of your member
>Her head quickly slides back down to the base of your crotch
>It’s like she has absolutely no gag reflex
>She slurps and pulls at your dick with increased aggression as time goes on
>Each stroke becomes stronger and more intense than the last
>Not to mention her speed as well
>It’s no surprise when you feel that familiar tingling starting in your groin, slowly building up and up, hailing the approach of your orgasm
>And by this time she’s practically fucking her own face, ravenously slurping at your dick
>The force almost becomes too much
>It’s like she’s trying to suck your entire crotch off
>You announce that you’re going to cum, only to feel her double down on her efforts
>She slides your dick inbetween her lips and down her throat, in a desperate bid to work a load out of you
>And her work pays off when you finally feel your orgasm hit
“Fuccccck,” you groan
>She slams your cock down to the base just as you start shooting your load
>You feel your dick jump and twitch as you drain your balls down her hungry throat
>Your orgasm lasts for what feels like several minutes as you grunt and strain against the velvet coaxing of her eager mouth

>A needy whine escapes from her once she finishes guzzling down your load
>Slumped against the pillow, wallowing in your post orgasm bliss, you watch as your roommate climbs onto all fours, her whole body trembling with need 
>And as she turns her ass towards you, you can see why she’s trembling
>Saying that she’s “wet” would be a tremendous understatement
>She’s absolutely soaked through her light blue panties 
>Normally you’re a one and done kinda guy, but when you see her infectious need to get bred, stuffed, and fucked, you’re filled with resolve
>Claire, on the other hand, would rather be filled with something else, and it shows when she casts a glance at you over her  shoulder 
>”You s-said you wanted to help, so…”
>Her voice drops to a husky moan
>”P-Please fuck me.”
>How could you say no when she asked you so nicely?

>While you want more than anything in the world right now to pound the ever loving shit out of your roommate, your cock is going to need to recover for a bit
>But Claire doesn’t look like she can hold out for very long, so you think of something you can do to buy yourself some time
>As you watch her nicely rounded ass sway back and forth, the solution becomes obvious
>She coos softly when you peel her panties off her body
>Even in the relative darkness, you can see what a slutty mess she’s become
>Her bright pink slit, which sits in contrast against charcoal black of her fur, is completely slick and shimmering with juice
>You don’t touch it, but even putting your hand near her crotch, you can feel the immense heat pouring out of her
>Well, here goes nothing. Let’s hope she’s as kinky as her art suggests
>The palm of your hand ricochets off her plump ass with a loud *smack*
>She yips and lurches forward at the warm, yet subtle sting of your open hand
>But you notice that she doesn’t protest, nor move away
>She raises her ass back into position, whole body trembling, tail now lightly fanning in anticipation of your next move
>Well, guess you know what she’s into

>You give her left asscheek a solid swat this time, and instead of yipping, a feral moan spills out of her throat
>This kind of reaction from her is doing wonders for your dick, but it’s not enough
>So you continue lightly palming and squeezing her supple ass, digging your fingers into the pliable mountains of her flesh
>And in between massaging, kneading and generally feeling her up, you deliver a series of spanks that would a make a Catholic School Nun proud
>With each tight smack, she shivers and begs for the next one to be even harder
>Again, when she asks so nicely, how can you resist?
>And while hearing her desperate moans is certainly fun, watching what her body does is even better
>You slow your swats against her ass and watch as her pussy quivers and contracts when you make contact
>Thin runners of girl-juice string their way down from her engorged lips and dangle between her thighs
>The ones that don’t make it that far down end up just adding to the mess that is her crotch, bridging the gap between her inner thighs and her moist sex
>Noting this curiosity, you resume swatting her ass, only to feel something splatter against your leg
>How is it possible for her to be this turned on?!

>You grin as you watch her body tense up, just a few well-placed touches away from orgasm
>She gasps, hands knotting up tightly into the sheets
>”Anon…Anon…” She pleads
>You run a finger down the small of her shivering back, through her dampened fur
“You’re a good girl, Claire…”
>Her tail starts fanning like crazy
>It’s time for your final assault
>You grab the base of her tail and stop the appendage in its frenzied motions
“But you’re gonna cum like a bitch.”
>Your free palm finds her ass in firm, rhythmic strokes each one becoming deeper and more forceful than the last
>She yelps and moans with each swat, until you deliver your final stroke, which sends her screaming over the edge
>In all the porn you’ve watched, you’ve NEVER heard someone yell as loud as she did
>You swear she started howling at some point during her cunt-shattering orgasm
>She actually managed to rip a hole in your bed sheets during her pleasure convulsions
>When it’s finally over and you’re sure she’s woken up everyone in the complex, she lands face first into the sheets, her drenched and still quivering ass propped up into the air, too overwhelmed to have any dignity
>Oh, but it’s not over, because you still need to get yours
>Your cock stiff and ready to go for round two, you grab her by the hips and pull her close to you

>”Yesss…” she hisses, “do it, fuck a baby into me…”
>Oh boy she’s completely out of her mind and talking gibberish
>This oughta be fun!
>And what better position to fuck your blissed out, hormone-drunk canine roommate in than doggystyle? 

>As you slide your dick into her, every hot, velvety centimeter of her pussy squeezes down on you
>It’s enough to make you start drooling
>Jesus fucking Christ this is probably what angel pussy feels like
>If you were going to heaven before, you’re not anymore, because after what you’re about to do to her body, you’re pretty sure both of you are going to hell
>You slip deeper and deeper into her, teasing unrestrained moans out of your roommate
>When you finally bottom out, and your balls slap against her clit, she actually grunts
>Her reaction is enough to make you do it again
>And again
>And again
>And slowly you fall into a rhythm, pounding into her slippery cunt while she holds on for dear life
>You don’t know how much time has passed because every second spent fucking her is a pleasurable infinity
>You can feel every single inch of her inner-walls squeeze and contract around your rod, desperately attempting to milk a load out of you, almost as if they had a depraved mind of their own
>Your less-than delicate thrusts soon devolve into savage pounding as you grip and yank on her fur, if only to pull yourself a little deeper inside of her spasming passage
>How many times she’s cum, you have no idea, but you can feel (and hear) each one of her feral orgasms as she clenches and squeezes around your embedded shaft
>She doesn’t even mind when you slip a spit-slickened finger into her tight ass
>In fact, her next orgasm is probably the hardest one of the night
>Her whole body seems to be going all in on this one, because when it finally hits, she physically squeezes your dick out of her
>And though your finger remains stuffed up her ass, in the sweaty haze of your mind you’re worried her contractions might actually snap it in two
>Thankfully, you manage to keep your finger intact through her absurdly powerful orgasm, 
>Undeterred, you slide right back in and return to fucking away at her

>You don’t know how many times you came that night
>You remember painting her guts over and over and again with your splooge
>You remember her screaming and begging for you to cum inside of her, how she would shiver and sigh with delight as she felt your dick twitching and spasming buried deep in her pussy
>Every position you two seamlessly moved into was unforgettable
>Sometimes you two didn’t even wait until you could recover, you just went at it again and again in the sweaty darkness, fucking away her heat 
>By the time the two of finally collapsed, soaked in sweat, leaking cum, and utterly spent, you weren’t sure who the animal was
>You or her

>When you wake up the next morning, you feel Claire’s weight next to you
>She’s sleeping soundly on top of the covers curled up into a tight, naked ball of fluff
>There’s a smile on her face a mile wide
>Well, at least you know last night wasn’t some kind of weird dream
>...As evidenced by the abundance of loose hair in your bed, and the stains on your sheets
>You’re definitely going to have to wash that
>You roll out of bed as silently as possible and make for the kitchen
>You want coffee and food, but above all else you need water
>You slam as much as you can before capping off a waterbottle and bringing it to Claire
>You nudge her shoulder a couple of times until she peacefully sits up, rubbing sleep from her eyes
>”Morning…” she yawns, smacking her lips together a few times for effect
>You return her greeting and hand her the water bottle, instructing her to drink because she’s probably more dehydrated than you
>In between gulps she asks for the time
>You check your phone
“11:30. You slept like a rock.”
>”I know,” she blushes. “It’s this bed. I’m not used to sleeping on them. Growing up I had to share a pile of blankets with my brothers, so having a bed to sleep on was kind of a treat.”
“Well, I’m sure us banging the whole night might have contributed something to your sleepas well,” you chuckle
>She nervously smiles at you
>”Yeahhhh, about that... I know I said some things last night that might have sounded a little…weird...but that was my heat talking, not me.”
>You take the empty water bottle from her hands and set it on your dresser
“Don’t sweat it. I just hope I helped a little,”
>”You have no idea,” she sighs, “last night was the first night I felt any kind of relief since this whole shitty thing began. So I mean it when I say ‘thank you.’”
>You wink at her
“Anytime you need some ‘relief’ you know where to find me.”

>She shyly averts your gaze
>”You know...my heat is still going on-”
“Still, huh?”
>She nods her head
>“It goes on for a few weeks, just not as bad as it was last night. Some medicine might help me get through the rest of it, b-but since you’re here, and you’re offering, I was kind of hoping that…”
>Say no more fam
>You readily agree, but on one condition
>”Anything!” She exclaims, tail wagging
>You’re going to yell at the landlord to get the AC fixed first, a proposal to which she readily agrees to
>After a phone call to your landlord, you two spend the rest of the day together having sex
>In between sessions, you make some peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, help her do her laundry (which was sorely needed), and take cold showers together
>When you’re not fucking, you two cuddle and watch out the window as everything settles into a thin orange haze, simply enjoying each other’s company and closeness
>The sun climbs into the dusty July sky, and sets with orange brilliance
>You speak softly, sharing stories with each other about where you both come from and who you are
>She told you about how she always had a thing for humans, and how she thinks rooming with one might have triggered her heat and made it a lot more intense than usual
>And how your scent was driving her mad
>And if you really meant it when you said she could keep the shirt?
>When the AC finally sputters on you celebrate by cooking the last of her ground beef, which she still won’t admit to eating raw

>That night, after going at it again before bed, she’s curled up next to you, sound asleep
>You lay awake as the combined chill of the fan and the AC softly pass over you
>Tomorrow, or the next day, or the day after that, you’d go and get her medicine, you told yourself
>But now it feels like you two are finally getting to really know one another
>And as she starts softly kicking in her sleep, probably caught in a dream, you tell yourself that you’ve still got a lot more to learn about her
