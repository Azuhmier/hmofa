>you are anon once again and you're currently glaring out the back window at the mansion on the island in the middle of the lake
>as was mentioned before this house was built on the shore of a small lake and thus the people who lived around you tended to be well off retirees
>except for that guy who lives on the island
>to call him well off would be an understatement 
>you could tell just how filthy fucking rich this guy just based on the size of his house
>not even taking into account that the only way to get to it was by boat
>oh and guess what kind of boat he had
>a speedboat
>a really loud one
>but the boat has nothing to do with why you're madly glaring at his mansion right now
>no the reason for that was currently perched up on the tree in your backyard 
>the old coot had some sort of anthro parrot/parakeet? as a pet
>you don't really know that much about birds
>either way he let his precious pet out to do it's own thing in the summer
>what is it's own thing you might ask?
>spying on you from a tree through the massive windows that pretty much made up the entire back half of your house
>it did this everyday the weather permitted
>for hours on end
>honestly you're starting to get a bit pissed at the constant violation of your privacy 
>but theres nothing you can do about it
>no matter what you do the bird won't talk to you
>it just stares
>and as far as you can tell the owner never leaves his island so you can never catch him to ask him to control his pet
>you have to wonder if he's using the birds to spy on hie neighbors
>so you resign yourself to another day of being spied on cause you have your own pets that need to be kept under control 
>you turn around and see coco, her upper body entirely concealed from you, scrubbing away at the cabinet where she had locked the rat girl before
>it seems she had spooked the poor little girl to such an extent that she ended up pissing herself all over the inside of the cupboard
>it wouldn't take long for the smell to permeate the entire house so you had coco nip that problem in the bud 
>and that left bailey cleaning up your present
>the sudden sound of the washer rumbling to life signaling that she was pretty much done
>wasn't much later that bailey herself rounded the corner
"I put your bed sheets in the washer master, just as you asked"
>you don't remember asking her to come back to you looking like some crazed serial killer
>all the white parts of her fur were stained red with blood
>from her paws to her neck, almost down to her crotch
>you rub your temples in exacerbation
"Bailey, what happened?"
>she gives you nervous look
"Nothing master, i just got rid of your breakfast and cleaned your bed like you asked"
>is that what she thought of her present
>breakfast in bed huh
"Bailey, how did you get so dirty?"
>bailey then looks down on herself as if she only realized when you pointed it out
"Oh well, uh, I didn't want it to go to waste so i just kinda..."
>you cross your arms and give her an incredulous look
"I know your not that messy of an eater"
>bailey looks down and wraps her tail around herself again
>it's at that moment that coco pops herself out of the cupboard
"ALL DONE!"
>she then walks up to you with her best puppy dog face and tail wagging, obviously expecting praise 
>but you have to hold your nose at the pungent smell of piss that now seems to follow her
"All right you 2, move it on to the bathroom, it-"
>your cut off by bailey suddenly trying to make a break for the back door right behind you
>with you so close she doesn't get the door open in time and you manage to catch her around the waist and hoist her above the ground
"NOO PLEASE ANYTHING BUT THAT! I CAN CLEAN IT MYSELF! I PROMISE I'LL BE GOOD FROM NOW ON!"
>you hoist bailey up and lay her over one of your shoulders
"Come on now it's just water, it's not going to kill you"
>you start to make your way over to the bathroom but stop when you realize coco isn't following
"I'm not going to have to drag you to the bath too am I?"
>evidently coco isn't exactly thrilled about the prospect of being clean but she still begins to obediently follow you
>as you make your way over to the bathroom you begin to hear frantic licking sounds coming from behind your head 
>you guess that bailey is trying to quickly clean off her paws in order to avoid the bath
>when you reach the bathroom you wave coco in and lock the door behind her
>then you go to the other door to your bedroom and lock that too
>you set bailey down next to the tub and turn the faucet to begin filling it with lukewarm water
>as you kneel down to wait for the tub to fill you glance over to bailey to see if she's made progress on cleaning herself
>and as a matter of fact she has
>she's completely cleaned off her paws and lower belly and is currently licking around her lowest set of nipples
>it seems it doesn't make much at all to get the blood out of her fur
>just a quick swipe of her tongue
>she tries to avoid licking her nipples directly but still twitches cutely whenever her rough tongue grazes her areola 
>she makes quick work of her chest area but begins to run into the limits of her flexibility as she tries to go higher
>no matter how hard she tries her tongue won't reach her neck
>it's seems coco has been watching her as well
"Bailey hold on, let me do it"
>coco crawls over to her as bailey backs up but quickly runs into the tub
"H-hey wait, you don't have to do that, I-i can handle it myself"
>this doesn't stop coco from closing in on her
"No you can't, just let me help"
>bailey slides down the tub in a vain attempt to get further away from coco
>it doesn't help and coco tongues still makes contact with baileys vulnerable neck
>it seems cocos tongue is just as adept as baileys as she makes quick work of the stains bailey couldn't reach
>she quickly moves up onto baileys lower jaw as she quickly relaxes under the treatment
>then when coco's done with that she still makes her way up higher
>coco leaves one wet lick over baileys lips and cute little button nose before finishing up
"There was that so bad?"
>bailey gives herself a quick look over and holds out her arms
"All clean"
>you give yourself a quick chuckle 
"Yeah looks like it, guess your off the hook"
>bailey gives a quick yay and fist pump before running over and unlocking the door and leaving
>but not before sticking her tongue out at you
>now all there seems to be left to do is get this smell out of coco
>now as she watches the tub fill up her tail begins to wag
>it seems she's warmed up to the idea of a bath
>or maybe she just likes the idea of being alone with you
>you get the tub up to an acceptable water level and shut the faucet off
>coco dips her paw into the water to test it's warmth
>she seems to get an idea as her tail begins to wag faster
>she quickly tugs on your sleeve
"Hey master, I think you're looking pretty dirty yourself, maybe you should take these off and join me, we could wash each others backs that way~"
>you quickly deflate her hopes by pointing to the shower in the corner
"Humans take showers, not baths"
>she pouts as her tail stops wagging and defeated she gets in the bath and sulks
>to be honest you really wouldn't mind a bath sometime
>but in this house you exclusively take showers
>the reason why is related to another one of this houses questionable design elements
>namely the skylight
>placed directly over the bathtub
>who the fuck thought this was a good idea?
>maybe it wouldn't be much of a problem if it wasn't for your little spy
>as you looked up to check, sure enough he was there, staring down at you washing your dog
>you shook your fist at him and as always it elicited no reaction
>at least the shower was out of his sight
>you breathed in deep 
>normally in this kind of situation your ulterior motive might surface once again
>but you couldn't let that happen with him watching your every move
>just do some wholesome family washing
>squirt some shampoo in your hands, lather it in her fur and don't think about her delicious curves or fat ass
>while you were only washing her back or head keeping any illicit thoughts out wasn't too hard
>but when came time to do the same to her front was another story completely
>with her still sulking over being rejected coco wasn't going to be much of a help
>deep breaths 
>it wasn't any different from washing her back you told yourself
>but as your hands went to her fat tits those thoughts became hard to justify 
>her fuzzy boobs were amazingly soft in your hands and despite the warm water cocos nipples were hard as diamond
>they poked into your hands whenever you washed over them as coco gave cute little whimpers of pleasure
>and she had 6 more of these things
>but that was nothing compared to what waited below them
>for the moment you avoided that area and instead went on lathered her digitigrade legs
>that wasn't much better than her breasts really
>her legs were shapely and as you ran you hands around them you felt the coiled muscles underneath
>you scooted in closer to the rim of the tub in the hopes coco wouldn't notice your shame
>all that was left was her crotch
>thankfully since her cooch was hairless you didn't have to wash that directly
>but all the fur around it still needed to be washed
>and with her lips being so dark and puffy against her light fur it stood out prominently
>as you ran your hands around her mound you kinda pushed her lips tightly together
>as you did so you couldn't help but notice her clitoris was completely erect and poking out of it's pointed hood
"Well okay I think thats good enough"
>you quickly grabbed your handy dandy little bucket and began dumping water over her
>you were suddenly in a rush to get this done before something bad happened
>coco was still no help, showing her displeasure through inaction
>after getting the suds out as fast as possible you pull the plug and drain the tub
>you were about to get up to dry her off before you remember your predicament
>instead you turn your back to her and grab a towel and throw it her way
"Do you mind drying yourself off coco?"
>she pouts further but says
"Yeah sure thing"
>you unlock the door to your room and walk in before coco gets out of the tub
>you pretend to rummage through some stuff while cocos drying off
"Once your're done in there I'm going to go take a shower okay?"
>you hear a yeah come from the bathroom and some more ruffling of towels before coco calls out thats it's free
>you peek in to make sure shes gone before quickly locking both doors again
>you suppose a shower is as good a time as any to work off a little bit of stress right?
