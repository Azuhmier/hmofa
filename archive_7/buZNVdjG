>Be Anon
>PFC Anon, actually
>PFC Anon, 25th Infantry Division
>You were just another grunt in the hot Vietnam jungle
>it ain't me starts playing
>When draft time came around you pulled the short straw, and now here you were
>It fucking sucked and you miss your family
>Everything is extremely hot and humid, like Satan's version of Florida
>You are a member of a "tunnel rat" unit
>You and your battle buddies get stuffed down dark holes full of angry VC and traps with just a pistol and a flashlighthy 
>It's real dangerous work
>Just last week you lost a man to a pit full of shit covered punji sticks
>Last you heard of him he was getting pumped full of antibiotics after getting his leg amputated
>You got some time off after that, which was nice
>it's hard to care when you've become so jaded
>Now you're sitting in the back of a helicopter with your comrades
>sympathy for the devil starts playing
>Some other unit reported some tunnels in an area they had secured
>Fucking pussies wouldn't clear it themselves so they radioed home and now it's your problem
>The helicopter sets down in a clearing, and your fireteam leader yells over the noise of the spinning blades for you to disembark
>The team spreads out around the helicopter as it takes off
>"Alright, get over here you all" your leader shouts
>Your comrades were everything BUT gentle
>"We've got a short hike to the tunnels, so keep your boots on"
>"Seven miles west, through enemy territory"
>What was the fucking helicopter for, then?
>"Oh, and you're taking point, Anon"
>Triplefuckzingshittits
>Pointmen were always the first to step on the traps
>fucking gay
>You take your first few steps into the heavy green bush
>Fortunately, the hike is uneventful, although you almost shat yourself and squealed like a girl when you stepped on a snake
>More fuel for the guys to tease you about, great
>You would have missed the other unit entirely if it wasn't for the fat boxy APC they had with them
>After exchanging unenthusiastic greetings with them, you are your team are grouped around a small hole in the ground
>"You check this one, Anon. We got a few more over here"
>Time to get messy
>You lay your rifle on the ground and take off your shirt
>No need for modesty, it gets super hot out here
>With your revolver in your right hand and a flashlight in your left, you descend into the cramped tunnel
>You wiggle through the tunnel, stopping to check every inch of tunnel before you
>You brain chooses this moment remember how some VC release venomous snakes into their tunnels
>Best not to think about it
>Not much later, and without any more snakes, you reach a large chamber you can squat down in
>The room is stacked full of crates, and a quick peek through the a lid reveals the regular assortmenr of rusty weapons
>Gonna need to crawl back and report it
>Before you can take a single step, you hear all hell break loose outside
>Some big explosions rock the tunnel, threatening to collapse
>A machine gun opens up, firing for a good few seconds before there's a break
>"Anon! Get your ass back out here!" someone shouts down
>Don't need to hear it twice, you're out of there
>Despite crawling as fast as you can, it still takes you a minute to reach the opening
>As you poke your head out of the hole, you see things are not looking good
>The APC was now a burning husk, and the last few green uniformed men you could see were retreating into the brush
>In between you and them was a wall of very angry farmers
>With guns
>One of them turns their head, and your heart stops
>"Lính kẻ thù!"
>You've heard enough escaped POW stories to know what they would do to you
>No need to think, you leap out of the hole and sprint at thr closest treeline
>You can hear some men in hot pursuit, but a healthy diet of C rations has kept your body in tip top shape, and the malnourished VC in the dust
>Nah not really, you're panting like a dog
>After what feels like years of lung burning sprinting you realize you've lost them, and fall over against a tree, utterly spent
>Popping open your canteen, you take stock of your surroundings
>This is a swamplike area, with a murky, wide river
>Time to take inventory
>Water, check
>Rations, check
>Gun, ch- wait. Where's your gun?
>Fuck, somehow you managed to lose your only firearm, and now you are knee deep in enemy territory
>Worst of all, your socks are getting kind of wet
>Sighing, you remove your socks
>With absolutely no idea where you are, and the rapidly approaching night combined with your severe exhaustion, you can't help but drift off to sleep...



>You feel something isn't right
>And not just because you are hiding from crazy commie rice farmers
>Like... something else is there
>It's hard to describe, but you are awake now and you can't fall asleep again
>You sit still, listening to the bugs ask each other to fuck or whatever those noises mean
>The moonlight gleams off of the black river surface, giving you a nice look at the otherworldly pale disc
>Then it breaks
>Something... is standing up in the water
>Is that a man? It's shaped like a human
>No, it's much too large
>The shape could easily dwarf any man in your company
>Maybe you're hallucinating. That thing can't be real
>You decide to hold completely still, and pray it hadn't noticed you
>No luck
>The creature has apparently reaced full height, and is now lumbering slowly towards you
>A good estimate would be somewhere around 7 feet tall
>You begin to panic
>Being torn apart by a supernatural monster in the backcountry of a warzone was NOT your idea of an end to a life well lived
>Stay calm, Anon! You're a soldier! Think back to your training!
>The monster is about a car's length away from you now, and it stopped, as if to stare at you
>Try to remember some of the basics of CQC
>fail
>Frantic with fear, you grab the largest stick in reach, and charge the thing, yelling and swinging like a coked up baseball player
>With a single swipe, you're off your feet, and sail though the air right back into the tree you were leaning against
>Was that crack your stick or your spine?
>Ow, you kinda feel it now
>Everything goes black



>Slowly, your eyelids open
>You are in a hut, made out of a mixture of clay and earth
>Thankfully, the beast is nowhere in sight
>You definitely have broken something, but not your spine
>Moving to get up from your position on the floor zaps you with pain, but its better than waiting for that thing to come back
>Biting your lip, you pull your self up to your feet
>The hut is quite modest, with a sleeping bag, stool, and some boxes
>Mounted above the doorway a Kalashnikov rifle is displayed
>Tugging at it only succeeds in reigniting your pain, so you stop and step out of the hut
>You nearly piss yourself
>The monster, more clearly visible in the daylight, facing away from you
>And... it's a female?
>She was at least eight feet tall, and very muscular
>She had a nice set of hips and thighs too
>But, most noticeably, her body is covered by thick, shiny scales, creating an impressive layer of biological armor, although it seems to get a bit softer around her ass and
>Her large head has the long and powerful face of an alligator
>Wait, alligators only live back in the States, right? She must be a crocodile
>The croc woman still hasn't noticed you, preoccupied with what looks like your equipment
>She is trying to fit your combat helmet over her head, with no success
>The poor helmet is simply too small for her, after a few moments she grunts and tosses it away in frustration
>OK, that's it, time to go
>Maybe you will be able to mark this place on a map so someone can drop napalm on this place
>You turn to leave
>"Human!"
>You think your heart stopped beating
>Turning around, you can see SHE IS LOOKING RIGHT AT YOU
>She has nice tits but it's hard to get a boner when all your blood has turned cold with fear
>"You attacked me?" she hisses
>"Uh, look I'm sorry! I was just uh trying to get away from some people" you whimper
>"I know what you are, soldier"
>Fucking great, the VC have a giant lizard on their team
>Her face looks pretty angry, or maybe it's just the shape of her head?
>Luckily, she calms herself after a moment
>She sighs
>"I have not had company in a very long time" she says
>"I forgave you for attacking me. You owe me"
>It's probably not a good time to point out how she broke a bone or two of yours
>"Alright, but I have to leave after" you answer
>She gestures back inside

>What have you gotten yourself into?
>Only like a day ago you were playing cards and shooting the piss at an army base
>Now you're having tea time with a fucking lizard woman?
>She offered you the stool, and sits crosslegged on the ground
>She made you a hot drink of some sort in a firepit outside, and then just sat there staring at you
>After a minute of this, you decide to break the ice
>"So, uh, what's your name?" you stammer, spaghetti rations pouring out of your pockets
>"I have never had a name before. The locals call me thằn lằn với bộ ngực to. A bit too long for my taste."
>She gives you a terrifying smile, with rows and rows of daggerlike teeth
>"Oh, well I'm PFC Anon"
>"Nice to meet you Anon. Care to tell me what you are up to all the way out here?"
>Is it a good idea to tell a hermit lizard lady about military operations? Is she actually with the VC?
>"I, uh, got lost in the heat of the moment. What do you think about the war?" you inquire
>"I'm not a fighter, I don't interact with the natives. Whatever battles they are fighting are not my own"
>You raise an eyebrow and gesture to the gun on the wall
>"Oh that? That's just decoration. A trophy from some of the last people that attacked me. Aside from you of course. I'm not even sure it still works, besides I have no idea how to use it."
>You take a sip of the drink
>Tastes pretty good for swamp water. Very herbal
>"Are there many of your kind around here?" you ask
>"Nope. Just me. I like having the strongest overbite around, too"
>To prove her point, she opens her large jaws, and suddenly shuts them with a loud crack
>You wince
>"Well uh, I should probably leave now. I'll be reported missing" you say
>The croc just huffs
>"Alright, but you're 13 kilometers from the nearest military camp I know of. Plus you got your brains rattled around a bit, and you have no weapons, you don't even have a shirt"
>Suddenly you feel very self conscious about some amazonian animal monster looking at you half naked
>She doesn't seem to mind, and she leans forward, grinning savagely at you
>"It's alright Anon, you can stay for a bit, if you help me with something
>Is this the part where she fucks you and then eats your head?
>"You're a soldier. I want you to show me how to use the gun. You do that for me, and I'l show you the way back" she states
>Whew
>"Sure. It's not to hard, I'll just-"
>As you stand up, another splitting headache strikes, and you topple over, clutching your head
>She kneels over you, but makes no move to touch you
>"I guess that is my fault, isn't it?" she grumbles
>She grabs you by the wrist and pulls you onto your feet, and leads you to the sleeping bag
>"Anon, you've got enough on your plate for now. Rest"
>"But..."
>"Stay" she commands, and walks right out of the tent
>Well that's great
>You've been away from your unit for almost a day now, you were probably marked M.I.A.
>Your fireteam leader must be pissed
>Your headache is at full blast now, thinking is practically impossible
>Aaaaauughhhh you would kill for some motrin
>Your body finally takes pity on you, and you fall into darkness.

>Waking up, you shake your head and realize it's the middle of the night
>You must have been really out of it
>It's super dark, can't see shit
>You fish out your trusty lighter from your pants pocket and light it
>Croc lady is fast asleep in the corner
>She's curled up, almost like a dog, with her long meaty tail wrapped around her face
>A bit of fresh air would probably help make you feel better, it's not like you would be able to fall back asleep again anyway
>You step out of the hut, footsteps muffled by the sound of cicadas
>The little gear you still had on you when you got lost was lying in a pile, right where she had left it
>You spark your lighter and take a look
>Your helmet, a cigarette carton, a few revolver speedloaders, grenades, spade, survival handbook, etc
>Everything as it was, aside from your helmet, bent completely out of shape from her forceful attempt at wearing it earlier
>That guide would probably be a good read right about now
>You take it back inside to your sleeping bag and lie down
>You idly page through the guide, not really paying attention to it
>Most of the stuff you had already memorized
>You just keep stealing glances at the exotic humanoid asleep a feet away from you
>She's kind of cute actually, when she's not a large shape in the dark
>Even if her jaw could crack your skull wide open

>You wake up to the sound of gunshots
>Shit! You had dozed off again and now you're being attacked
>You scramble to your feet, and look around in a panic
>Croc lady is nowhere to be seen
>You sprint out the door, making a breal for it, to get stopped dead in your tracks
>She's got her old rife out, and struggling to hold it correctly
>In front of her is a crudely made wodden dummy, made of logs, with your heavilly dented helmet perched right on top
>"Morning Anon" she says, noticing
>"I decided to get an early start. These things are quite unweildly for someone of my, ah, stature"
>"You know, if I'm going to teach you, I'm going to need a name" you say
>"Hmm, you come up with something. I don't mind"
>A quick thought flashes through your mind
>"How about Sierra?"
>Really? That's part of your fireteam's callsign, and she's not your fucking mascot
>She gives you a very toothy grin
>"That will be adequate"
>Okay then
>Sierra then shoves the rifle into your arms
>"Show me how it's done, Anon"
>Okay then
>You're not the worst shot in the company, but you're no marksman, and this gun is quite unfamiliar to you
>You've gotta show her you're not completely useless, though
>You lie down on your stomach, and line up the posts
>You take a breath and hold it
>BAM!
>You missed completely
>Way to go
>As Sierra squints to if your shot landed on the dummy's body, you let out a few bursts, hitting the target straight on
>Your old beaten helmet goes flying off and rolls down the bank and into the water
>"Burst fire. More shots down range means more chances of hitting your target, and controlled bursts allow you to maintain accuracy while firing. You don't need the precision of a sniper being an infantryman like me" you lecture
>Just some stuff you came up with on the fly
>Sierra eats it up though, nodding and considering every word
>You spend a few more minutes explaining basic marksmanship, alligning the sights, weapon operation, sight dialing to compensate for range
>Eventually, you think it's time to give her another shot, literally
>A quick search turns up your mangled mess of a helmet, and you put it back up top of the dummy
>You hand her the gun, and instruct her to aim and fire
>Sierra gingerly feeds her long clawed finger through the trigger guard, turns the safety off, and takes aim
>CRACK!
>That was not the sound of the gun firing, but the sound of the abused metal helmet exploding into shrapnel, scattering in all directions
>Neither of you have time to duck, and a large sharp chunk goes straight into Sierra's stomach, knocking her flat
>Oh FUCK
>You race to her side and drop to your knees, expecting to see her in pain, or angry at the very least
>Instead she is laughing like a madman
>It's a bit concerning, as you could have very well been hurt too
>There is no wound, that can't be
>Are her scales really that hard?
>"These scales aren't just for show ya know" she giggles
>She playfully cracks her fist on her rock hard belly
>"A-are you really fucking buleltproof?" you ask
>"Well I won't just sit there are let you shoot me, but it hurts a lot less to me than it would for you" she says
>Fair enough
>"How about we get you some food?" she says
>Come to think of it, you haven't eaten in long time
>She gestures for you to wait, and carries the gun inside before returning with a crude looking spear and a net
>She tosses the net to you, and leads you deeper into the swamp
>After a while of uneventful wading through murky swamp water, you ask her what you're hunting for
>"Crocs, silly"
>But SHES a croc
>Isn't that cannibalism?
>This gets a heavy laugh from her
>"Not things like me, idiot. Proper chompy lizards. Would you eat a monkey if you had too?"
>Not really, no, but you keep that thought to yourself
>Sierra stops abruptly, and looks around
>"Yes, this is a good spot"she says
>"Now it's my turn to teach you something"
>Sierra lowers herself down into the water, until she is completely submerged and hidden
>You feel a bit nervous, as she left you all alone in some swamp
>There are mangroves sprouted all around you, offering many places for fish to hide
>You still have the net, maybe you can use it
>Before you can act, however, the water to your right explodes like someome threw a grenade in
>Sierra threw an actual crocodile ten feet in the air wtf
>She proceeds to tackle it while it is still stunned, and like a professional, she quickly sits on top and wraps her arms around it's jaws, preventing it from opening with her inhuman strength
>The poor thing doesn't stand a chance, Sierra's full bodyweight pins it to the ground
>She gives you a strained look
>"Don't just stand there, Anon! Do something!"
>You pull your survival knife, and she lifts the actual croc's head up, exposing it's throat
>A quick swipe, and a few moments later the crocodile stops moving, letting out it's last death spasms
>Sierra rolls off the dead beast, and looks at you with pride
>"I'm the apex predator around here, so don't get on my bad side!" she smirks
>You roll your eyes and start field dressing the dead croc
