>that siren is for tornados

>oh shit
>a red and orange streak was barreling through the sky at an alarming rate
>from the west there was more

>how'd your car end up crashing?
>how long were you out? It's couldn't be too long.

>thank your lucky stars that this looked like the heavy duty chain link fence
>hell, there was even barbed wire on the top of it
>maybe this had been some military checkpoint before it rusted out
>makes sense now
>but what doesn't make sense is why it's *here*
>*here*

>something pops into your head that you instantly began fearing

>if they were nukes that close to you when exploding wouldn't you just get vaporized?
>maybe that would explain the less cars on the road

>here you were
>stuck in your own mind
>could still hear what was going on around you
>it had first started as loud animal grunting
>then came a voice
>"What the hell is a human doing all the way up here? The Rubble Beetles and Horned Wolves'll kill him!"
>couldn't tell what he was doing
>"Did he..."
>he went quiet for a while
>"His arm should be turned black by now! That bite's fucking huge! I have to get him back to the Doc... How the hell is his arm still on him?"
>that was disconcerting
>what the hell did he mean your arm shouldn't be on?
>these "Horned Wolves" have some means to render an arm useless?
>and what the hell was a Rubble Beetle
>for a while it was completely silent
>then there was the sound of gates opening and heavy footfalls
>"Ryan! What the hell are you doing with a human on your Rhino? You know we don't let them into Under-I after the problem with the bandits!"
>"Shut up Harrison, you stupid rabbit! I'm bringing him into the Doc. His arm didn't come off after a bite from one of the horned wolves and the Doc'll be able to tell why."
>a scoff came from the direction the voice had come from
>"If he wakes up and causes any trouble then it's your head. Fucking chickens. Can't stand to do guard work so you head off on your Hairy Rhino and "scout" the area around us. Pansy."
>another period of time passed without noise
>wait
>your eyes are open
>look up to see a stereotypical Leghorn chicken standing over the bed and looking intently at your wounds
>then there was a snow white dog man looking into your eyes with a flashlight
>"Alright, any news Doc? I've been dealing with flak from that asshole Harrison about this one."
>the dog's looked at the Ryan
>"It's been years since I've seen a case of this. A decade in the least."
>"Just get to the point Doc."
>the flashlight in Doc's paws clicked off and he sighed
>"You remember what you were taught in class years ago, right?"
>Ryan shook his head
>"Damn it. Try to keep up okay?"
>the chicken nodded
>"80 years ago there was an electronic malfunction that spread throughout North Korea. In and of itself that wasn't much of a problem, but when their power grid came on it sent hundreds of ICBM missiles streaking through the sky. Each of them were carrying a nuclear payload that could devastate a city the size of Los Angeles. NATO, Russia, China, anyone with nuclear weapons launched them to assure the destruction of their enemies. Mutually Assured Destruction."
>your mind blanked
>80 years?
>what the hell
>nukes?
>the air raid sirens
>it's beginning to make sense
>"Alright Doc, but what do those have to do with this human right here?"
>"Everything!"
>the doctor lashed out at Ryan
>"No one's quite sure why, but the after the bombs fell people started appearing out of nowhere. It wasn't ever consistent with a schedule. There could be three found in a week or none found in a year. The mysterious people cropped up in random places with memories of nuclear blasts and their lives prior. At first it was thought that they just suffered from serious, mind altering delusions, but that changed after the first person passed through The Wall out west."
>Ryan gawked at him
>"Damn it Ryan. The Wall is a potent wall of radiation that acts as a barrier between our side of the country and everything west of the Rockies. The human that made it through was one of these "delusion" sufferers. He told of the desert on the other side, of monsters lurking under the sand, and of kingdoms cropping up that survive in the harsh land. The radiation hadn't killed him. The reason? He was exposed to massive amounts of radiation in moments and survived. This gave credence to their memories of nuclear blasts. Many theorize that the reason these "Passers" arrived here has something to do with that electronic malfunction that struck North Korea, but it isn't proven. Some in the College tried to explain it with rudimentary science, but I thought out of the box!"
>the dog man laughed heartily
>"Parallel Universes. I theorize that we came into contact with a parallel universe when North Korea had their malfunction. We stayed stuck to the parallel universe just long enough for their power grid to turn on and send the nukes on their warpath alongside ours. Our nuclear weapons switched places during that time, replacing our North Korea's ICBMs with their North Korea's ICBMs. Since our nuclear weapons were tied to our world, they pulled in humans that survived the blast from their world to ours. Now there's two separate kinds of humans here. Our humans and the Passers."
>the chicken looks directly at your eyes
>"So this guy's a Passer? That must be why he didn't lose the arm."
>Doc tapped Ryan on the beak
>"Precisely! Horned Wolves inject a radioactive substance into one's arms that stops at the shoulder and turns it black. By being a Passer, this man was able to treat it like any other bite."
>this was all going over your head
>nukes?
>parallel universes?
>what the hell kind of shit did you find yourself in now?
>god damn it
>attempt to move

>"Well Anon, I'd say you're lucky. I've often thought that it's a one in a million chance that Passers make it over. That in and of itself would be worth praise, but surviving a Rubble Beetles's boulder? They can shoot those out at speeds of nearly 75 mph."

>"Alright man, don't do anything hasty! I'm just a driver for the Rondell Family. Our operation up north got disrupted and we were told to look for someone in a rickshaw. They didn't tell me anything. I wasn't even allowed within five blocks of the location either, man!"
>sigh
>"You caught us I guess. They were butchering, uh," think back to what Ryan called them during the drive, "anthros? They were killing them and selling the organs."
>he froze

>"Alright man, alright. I'm getting outta here while I can. That kind of thing ain't my scene, dude."
>stop him

>he recoiled for a moment
>"Uh, yeah, I was the driver for the guys sent after you."
>"What."
>Sasha took a step towards him
>"What do you mean "sent after"? We killed everyone that was chasing us!"
>he took a step back
>"Now listen Sasha, it's not my fault! You had been poking around, man. The boss doesn't take kindly to Nosey-Nancies."
>she took a pair of steps
>"And if you don't start telling us how you found us, you're gonna be a Beaten-Blue Bruce."
>he kicked the tiles
>"According to those, uh, those guys that are against the wall over there, a rickshaw was missing."
>Ryan steps up and tries to be intimidating
>"Yeah? We killed the guy and took h-!"
>you smack him in the back of the head
>"Like hell you did. I did."
>Sasha steps back
>"Damn it Jimi. You've fucked up royally this time..."
>a smirk came across her face

Quite a haul you got here ain't it? While it ain't like when I had the materials to make my own, selling old or used guns still makes me money. For all this I can get you $1800. I'm paying you primo dinero for this stuff, 'specially since you had those SUB-2000s in box."

>he flips the gun over and points out a number on the metal loop
>"001"

>"Hey, Anon right? I'm Casey. I've known Sasha for, what, nine years now?"
>"Almost."
>you sit down amidst the crew you've assembled over the last week
>a long week it's been
>you've been shot at
>your left arm and leg have been broken by giant beetles and (somehow) healed by a doctor in three days
>hell, you've been transported from your home by nuclear weapons from a parallel world
>all in a world with humans and animal people
>now everyone is getting ready to kill off a mob family
>great
>seems Casey is keen on telling you more about herself
>"Like I said, I've known Sasha for nearly nine years. She's like the sister I always wanted. After hearing she disappeared I was devastated! I did a little bit of digging and found that she had been looking around in the Rondell Family headquarters nearby."
>she slams back a shot of something
>"I've never much cared for that cocksucker Edward. Always acting like he's better than everyone else, sacking caravans from Johnston further south, pissing on the people that made up his father's legacy."
>bad blood
>must be that Casey was indebted to Edward's father
>"Now the Rondell's are thugs. They used to act like a militia in return for supplies, but now they extort and kill. Sasha got a hold of me while you were out, Anon. The instant I heard her say she needed help I agreed."
>she extends her talon
>shake it
>"We should probably get out of here."
>you whisper to the people at the table after noticing the bartender had started getting closer
>eavesdropping
>Ryan is in a drunken stupor by now
>Jimi is high as a kite
>just you, Sasha, and Casey are fully aware
>"Sasha, mind getting Ryan? I'll take care of the dread-head."
>you lift the stoner up, fireman carry him upstairs, and get into the room Sasha pointed out
>place him in an old recliner chair in the corner
>he's out like a light
>now's as good a time as any
>pull your map out of your pocket and place it on a table
>"Well, well, well! Seem's Anon can map out escape routes like an old pro."
>Casey patted your back
>take a while to go over the hidey-holes and escape routes you planned out
>Sasha then produced a map of the Rondell Family's headquarters
>drawn from memory
>she tells Casey that she and Ryan are going to enter in through the back and take care of any guards there are back there
>Sasha and Jimi are going to go in through the front
>create a distraction
>wait
>what about you?
>what are you going to do in this?
>"You're going to go into their HQs with a fake business proposal. While you're in his fancy meeting room we'll be kicking ass and trimming the family tree."
>that made you a little worried
>if the bartender was any indication, there might be some trouble
>"If you're worried about it, don't worry! I got you a three piece suit! You'll look the part."
>all you could do was nod
>where would your weapons go?
>"You'll still be able to hide a few guns on you. Don't give me that look! You can't just walk in there armed to the teeth like you have been since we left that meat processing place."
>try to think of a rebuttal
>can't
>nod your head
>look out the glazed windows to see that it's getting pretty dark now
>sleep starts to cloud your eyes
>maybe all that running around today was catching up to you
>"H-h-hey guys. I'm gon' take this bed o'er here."
>Ryan waved at you and fell beak first into one of the two beds
>"I'll take the couch if that's fine."
>Casey hops onto the couch
>Jimi is just in the corner stoned out of his gourd
>he's got the recliner all right
>that left
>oh
>that left one bed
>Sasha sends a light punch into your shoulder
>"Come on. Don't give me that look! It's not a death sentence."
>still, sleeping next to a tiger that could probably bench press you wasn't really high on your "to do" list
>reluctantly get into bed

>good
>there's hope for them yet
>"For those who don't remember or were too indisposed last night, here's a rundown. Ryan, you're sneaking in the back with Casey. Jimi? You're going in with Sasha, guns blazing. Me? I'm a distraction."
>tighten your tie
>not too tight
>"I have to act like a business man. While I'm in there acting like an idiot, you're all going to do your jobs. Flawlessly, I might add."
>they nod and then relax right afterwards
>"I'm going to head there now. Ryan, Casey, you leave now and make your way around to their building. Jimi and Sasha are going to leave five minutes after I do."
>"Alright Anon, just don't get yourself killed."
>shoot a glance at Ryan
>"I won't."

>you finally get ushered into through an ornate gold and wood door
>a lavish meeting room

>plush chairs with red velvet cushioning

>several minutes pass by while the two of you talk business

>Edward looks at you with half lidded eyes
>"I already know you've been talking shit this entire time. Drop the act. You and your friends are going to die here. Rosco, do it."

>the two guards departed right after
>Rondell was just sitting in his seat looking down at you with amusement
>"Bet you didn't think I had that bartender on my payroll. Makes sense. If you did, you would have found a place better than a bugged room to discuss your plans to kill me."
>that didn't even occur to you that there might be bugs in your hotel room
>you grasp your side and try to put pressure on the wound

>your subconscious realized it could only delay the inevitable for so long

>he's visibly freaking out from the drivers seat of whatever vehicle you all were in
>Ryan was driving, Jimi was riding up front, Casey was in a seat further back, and Sasha was busy trying to keep pressure on your wound

>"Can't this thing go any faster?! It feels like we aren't moving at all!"
>Ryan shoots a look back at her
>"I don't want him to die either! I'm stepping on the gas, dodging the rusted out cars and trucks, and avoiding any animals on the road! You want to take my place?"

>what did he mean?
>the vehicle slams through the gate and comes to a grinding halt as fast as possible
>Sasha picked you up and carried you in through the underground entrance while Jimi and Casey stayed behind

>"Don't worry, Anon, we're going to get you taken care of. There isn't a chance in hell that fucker in black is taking you. Not today, not tomorrow, not ever!"
>she finally busted through a door and was met with a snow white dog's maw
>"Anon! What are you d-"
>Sasha realized he was the doctor almost immediately by the lab coat and the red cross on the wall behind him

>she carries you to the bed and gently sets you down
>"Don't worry, ma'am, I've helped him before and I'll help him again."

>mainly because you were in a coma, but who's judging?
>"Sasha! Get a crate or two! We're taking all the booze!"
>that put a smile on her face
>she rushed upstairs to get back what we left here, then grabbed a few wooden crates from nearby
>there were several dozen kinds of beer and ale in 12 oz. bottles
>then came all the good stuff

>fuck was it beautiful
>you pried the cap off of an old, cheap beer and downed it

>find some cream, salt, different mixes, sugar
>this place was incredibly well stocked for a place that was under Rondell's boot
>fuck
>you didn't think of that
>Rondell must have been hitting caravans and giving his informant some of the alcohol
>take one of the short glasses, pour in some vodka, some coffee liqueur, and then the cream
>mmm
>white russian
>let's just hope you don't get mistaken for someone else with the last name Anonson
>make one for Sasha as well
>if you're both here, you may as well enjoy it
>just as you finish making it you see Ryan walk through the door
>"Whoa, what happened here?"
>did you tell Ryan about the bartender being part of the Rondell Family?
>tell him just in case you didn't before
>"I'll go tell the guards to come get him then."
>he leaves the Nosebleed
>that left you with Sasha
>grab the bottle of vodka, coffee liqueur, cream, and the drinks you poured
>bring them over to a wraparound booth nearby
>Sasha grabs her drink and sits across from you
>for a few moments it was really awkward
>yet here you were, sitting across from the tiger that said she loved you
>you still hadn't responded to her question
>drink a little of your white russian
>she does the same
>damn it
>this wasn't going to be easy
>"So... Anon. How's the drink?"
>it was pretty good
>especially since you hadn't had one of these in the longest time
>"So, did you happen to think about what I said earlier? Before the Doc' interrupted us I mean."
>your heart felt like it was in your throat
>beating like a jackhammer
>it was like your heart was traveling without moving
>without a second thought you blurted it out
>"I love you too Sasha."
>she slowly moved from the seat across from you to the open spot to your left
>"You mean it right?"
>you nod your head before she wraps her arm around you
>pulling you in close

>sitting here with Sasha and getting tanked started getting more fun
>as your new friend group (now with the Doc') started showing up, you drank another white russian
>the tiger to your right started in on another herself, along with a shot of "Johnny Balm's Woodword Reserve" whiskey
>after she's poured herself a shot, take the bottle from the table and get yourself one too
>if anything is gonna happen, it's gonna need to be done drunk
>only because you're sure she'd break your pelvis in
>down the shot and start in on half of a white russian
>Ryan, your Leghorn chicken friend, slid into the booth across from you two
>"So, that bartender huh? The guards that took care of him said to leave at least two six packs behind."
>get up from the booth slowly and make your way towards the crates of alcohol
>find two packs of some sort of local beer from before the bombs
>"Creator's"
>bring them out to the two guards outside the shop
>they're thankful for it
>back to the booth, and before you know it Sasha had her arm around your shoulders
>all Sasha did was down another shot and shoot you a toothy grin
>Ryan seemed a little more skittish after that
>Casey, the town's chemist, slid in the booth right next to Ryan 
>Jimi is off doing god knows what
>and the Doc is probably off reading notes
>all that matters right now is taking your mind off of last week's events
>getting out of Under-I earlier put it into perspective
>this place really is kill or be killed
>having even one escape, be it a woman, a bottle, or whatever Jimi does, can keep your sanity
>take the shot glass from Sasha
>pour another a shot, down it, and do one more
>"There we go! About time we saw you really cut loose. Gotta make up for the week you were in a coma, right?"
>Ryan chuckled and put back some of his beer
>"You're one to talk, Foghorn. You're only drinking a beer."
>Casey elbowed him in his ribs
>instinctively move, but he didn't spit out his drink
>he swallowed and slammed the beer on the table
>"T-That's only because the last time I had drank a full bottle to myself, I couldn't fight off that kidnapper."
>the crow chuckled and grabbed the shot glass from me
>think back to the night before the spleen merchant situation
>he had been swigging on something for a while
>thought it was water, but to each his own
>she poured him a shot of the whiskey and held it up to him
>"You're not going to let Anon drink you under the table are you?"
>well
>seems maybe there'll be a contest
>"I'm not gonna just sit here-"
>Sasha hopped over the back of the booth and walked over behind the counter
>"-while you two drink, you know. I'm gonna get in on this."
>seven shot glasses, another bottle of whiskey, and a crate of beer were plopped on the table a few moments later
>alcoholpoisoningdoesntexist.jpg
>there is that old adage
>beer before liquor, never been sicker
>look up towards the room entrances on the upper floor of the Nosebleed
>Jimi stumbles out a door slowly, along with a wafting of smoke pouring out
>almost falls down the stairs but makes it down in one piece
>Sasha cracks the lid on the crate and tosses two beers at the dread-head
>somehow manages to catch them
>"Woah, how'd you know I wanted beer?"
>the tiger has you move over further into the booth before sitting down
>"If you're not drinking and you're in Andel, what are you doing?"
>she chuckled before throwing her right arm around your shoulders
>"Besides, we're celebrating *this*-"
>she squeezed you
>"-guy's near death recovery!"
>she poured eight shots worth of whiskey out before passing two to everyone other than Jimi, who pulled up a chair to the booth end
>"Sorry Jimi, you'll have to get a shot glass if you're drinking this."
>he shakes his head
>"Beer before liquor, never been sicker."
>Ryan goes white as a ghost
>look over to see four beers down already
>he still accepts the shots Sasha pushed his way
>what a trooper
>once we all had our drinks we started in on it

>what felt like hours passed while the five of you got drunk
>whiskey shots, vodka, more white russians, and eventually the beer
>you learn a lot about them during this
>Sasha talked a lot about the jobs she would take while working under Rondell
>sticking up caravans headed north
>robbing that Pawn & Gun down on the main floor
>when you followed her story up with your own, the entire table couldn't stop laughing
>"Like a boomerang? What the fuck?"
>Ryan told some stories about when he was still a scout for Under-I
>he had actually searched the Walmart a few weeks prior to you arriving
>the wolf man must not have been home at the time
>it ended up being mostly stories of finding people after getting attacked by the wildlife
>never a good thing
>Casey explains how she came to be a chemist in town
>it started with a fascination for wintergreen when she was younger
>making anything from it turned into a career for her, and that eventually turned into an interest in chemicals and, most importantly, poisons
>that reminds you never to cross her
>poisons are hard to detect if you don't know what you're looking for
>you think you heard that before
>Jimi told us about how he had originally started working for Casey when he found these plants of some sort and started selling it alongside her own medicines
>you can imagine what kind of plants he found
>has the smoke from upstairs even cleared out?
>shake your head
>he eventually needed a second job because of the lack of caravans in town, and got hired as a driver for Rondell
>he had been the driver on several of the jobs Sasha had taken, so that's why they had known each other
>Doc had come and gone in the middle of it, having only come out of one of the first floor rooms to check on the noise the group had been making
>by the time the sun had went down, everyone was drunk and happy
>a much needed relief from the last two weeks of your life
>from being a no-skill wagecuck with a hobby of driving to getting crushed and shot near to death
>something about it is alluring in a way
>the smell of gunpowder sticking to your nostrils
>sounds the guns make when you shoot them
>clinking of the brass casings on the ground
>racking a slide
>clicking back a hammer
>knowing that even if you get hurt, there's a group of people that are willing to fight with you
>kind of like a dysfunctional family that doesn't leave you in a McD's parking lot
>but this one feels right
>just right
>look across the table at Ryan, who's polishing off another beer
>slur something out about him going to bed sometime soon
>"I-I-*hic*-I know. We're g-gonna do shomethin-*hic* about the bus t-tomorrow right?"
>nod while taking another swig of the beer in your hand
>Sasha has spent the entire time with at least one of her hands on you
>around your shoulder, on your thigh
>but even more lewdly
>((the hand))
>she looked down towards you and motioned for the two of you to stand up
>stagger your way up and look at her
>those beautiful amber irises boring into you
>she broke the eye contact and waved towards the two birds and Jimi
>"We're headed off to *hic* bed."
>Casey waves while Jimi takes a rolled cigarette from his hawaiian shirt pocket
>lights it up and waves us off
>as you take another step forward, her paw grabs your hand, pulling you along with
>every step you could feel your heart starting to pound harder
>it had been a while since you had any sort of action
>Sasha opens the door and ushers you in

>you hobble in and hear the door shut loudly behind you
>followed with a
>*click*
>you whirl around to see her eyes already trained on you
>she was on you in a moment, pushing you against a wall and hovering her muzzle above your face
>the breath coming from her nose hit you
>warm
>her lips pressed forward, locking with yours
>as soon as you pushed forward, she pushed back twice as hard
>it was like there was a real need behind it
>she broke the kiss and looked right into your eyes
>"You don't kno-*hic*-w how much I've wanted to do that."
>a grin covering her face
>you have some idea as to how much
>she leaned in and planted a kiss on the left side of your neck before slowly kneeling in front of you
>her paws went right for the button and zipper of your pants
>help out a little and pull them down
>it didn't take anything more than that before she buried her face in your crotch
>taking deep breaths
>"God, I thought sitting over you for a week was bad... You *hic* had me in a rut the entire time."
>Sasha looked up and shot you a toothy grin
>try to keep your composure while she gave you a tentative lick
>followed by a more confident, longer go up the length
>in an instant she had plopped your head in her mouth and placed a paw on your hip
>nearly the entire length disappeared right after
>you could feel her tongue cradling the bottom of the shaft whenever she moved her mouth
>that sandpaper texture you had somewhat expected wasn't there, but replaced with a more pleasurable experience
>the papillae must be different than a normal tiger
>focus
>look down to see Sasha's eyes half lidded as she goes to town on you
>by the time you realize it, she'd been at it for a minute or two
>pat her head and get her to stop
>suckling it on the way off
>it's time for the main course
>pull her up from the floor and bring her to the bed
>get her on her back
>undo the button and zipper on her pants
>go to pull them off
>she gets one leg through and slides the rest down to her ankle
>before you could take them all the way off, she grabbed your arm and pulled you down on top of her
>pressing you against her crotch
>Sasha's hand shot up to help guide you closer to the goal
>when you finally see it, you're grinning like a dope
>she's already soaked
>go to push forward
>it slides off
>this time she keeps her hand there to guide you
>look down at her as your head enters her
>her breathing caught for a moment
>now growing more ragged as you slowly press further
>getting inch after inch deeper until you're finally into the furthest reaches you can get to
>her arms wrapped around your neck
>hold yourself up with the bed as you begin pistoning yourself in and out of her
>slowly getting faster and faster
>in your drunken haze, you're certain your footing kept slipping while you went at it
>each moan she made sending you further and further into that rut you didn't realize you were in
>her cold nose pressed into your neck while she purrs under you
>enjoying every last moment you're giving her
>fall onto your elbow, pressing up against her even more
>pulling her tank top up to reveal her breasts
>take one in your hand while pounding away
>look up to see her covering her face
>"D-Don't *hic* look at me like that!"
>stutter out something between pumps about her act dropping fast
>that you're more than happy to take charge in the bedroom
>put even more into your frantic and heavy thrusts
>her back arched even more as you moved both your hands to her hips
>just that leverage was what you needed to get further into it
>before you knew it, she had your head in her chest and her purrs got even louder
>feel that all too familiar feeling deep in you
>a swelling
>mention this to Sasha
>she immediately threw her legs around your waist, pulling you as deep as possible
>those strong arms found their way around your back
>her paws nearly stuck to your back with how far her claws were out
>can't pull out
>those legs could probably crush your head like a melon
>no getting out of this situation now
>stop holding back
>a few more thrusts and it came
>rope after rope shot into her, each renewing the purring from the tiger under you
>as you finished, the haze and drinks finally caught up to you
>all you could hear for the few moments before passing out was a thank you

>wake up in a mass of short fur
>hear a song faintly coming from the bar's stereo system outside the door
>~"-she's mighty mighty, just letting it all hang out."~
>take a minute to look around 
>Sasha was laying against you with a dopey grin on her sleeping face
>the room could be described as barebones if anything
>a desk, a pair of beds, and an overhead light wired haphazardly to the middle of the ceiling
>the longer you look around, the more of last night that you start to remember
>the drinking
>the idle chatter between people
>Sasha taking you to the room
>pat her on the back lightly while staring at the dark wooden ceiling
>she rouses from her sleep slowly, gluing her eyes to yours when she realizes you're still there
>"Sorry, I'm just... just not used to waking up like this."
>assure her its fine, she wasn't bothering you at all
>her fur was a good insulator
>seeing as this place probably didn't have any insulation
>as she moves a little, the blanket covering you two falls
>get an eyeful of the tiger and smirk
>absolutely stacked
