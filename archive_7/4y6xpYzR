>Moving to the bayou was not one of the things you had wanted to do in your life.
>In fact, it was the very LAST thing you wanted to do.
>Why live somewhere with mosquitos the size of canned hams, Gators, crocs and a bunch of hicks?
>But you had to, your Music degree useless because Gary Motherfucking Oak made the best music synth ever.
>Or something like that, whatever the case, you couldn't get a job.
>So you hopped from stupid job to stupid job until you found yourself here in a bayou, working on a boat.
>Not a fisherman’s boat, but a boat that cleans Oil from spills and picks garbage out of the gulf.
>It's hard, honest work, and it pays the bills, so you can't complain.
>Presently, you're standing on the swaying deck of the boat as it approaches the pier to dock.
>the Captain, Mr. Howard Ortega, had been on a ship since he was old enough to walk and had been doing this clean-up stuff since the Deepwater oil spill in 2010.
>In other words, he was one of the best boat captains out there and knew the currents so well he could predict where the biggest amount of garbage would be.
>The cleanup company paid by the ton of garbage pulled in, so when he docked he would make bank, which is why you were paid well. 
>You listen to a bit of classical music as you watch the boat maneuver deftly to the garbage depository and scale.
>Todays music just missed so much of the old instruments, violins, saxophones, and tubas.
>The sights before you is an odd contrast to what you’re listening to.
>The beauty of the music, and the sight of tons of garbage being emptied into trucks.
>You had only been doing this job for about 2 weeks and you've already seen a dead body get collected too.
>Captain Howard says usually there is one every month or so; so you better get used to it.
>It was a long day today, Captain wanted to get out early and so you had to wake up at 0400 to get to work from your house to get to the docks by 0430.
>Now the sun was setting, and casting orange streaks on the clouds.
>Good thing you got a decent amount of money for this.
>After about 45 minutes of dumping trash out of the boat, Capt. Howard navigates it carefully to the dock, where you jump out and begin mooring her.
>After you finish her hear her engines die down and watch Capt. Howard walking towards you, counting out dollar bills, so you remove your headphones.
>"Good work today Anon, we got 5 tons, which means you get $500! I told ya getting up early would cash out" he says, trusting a wad of 20 dollar bills into your hands.
>"Yea yea, you're right, let’s just not make these 14 hour days a constant thing" You say as you pocket the bills.
>No need to count them out, he was good for the money and it would be rude to do that anyway.
>"Got any plans now? Wanna get a bite? My treat?" He says, looking up at the swirling sky before frowning. "Storms comin' in"
>You think to yourself about the night ahead of you.
>Just relaxing and eating leftovers were your plans, but hey you weren't going to turn down a free meal.
>"Sure Captain, what you have in mind" you say, looking skywards as well. 
>How can he tell a storms coming? To you it just looked windy.
>"I know a hole in the wall steak house us locals go to, get yer car an' folla me" He says as he starts walking, motioning for you to follow.
>You follow him off the dock, get to your car and turn it on, then wait for his Black pick-up to drive by so you can follow.
>your radio plays orchestral music, Tubas and Bassoons play their deep tones, while sousaphones play in a beautiful chorus.
>Skipping a few songs to find a certain track, you settle on it, you've always enjoyed music by Øystein Baadsvik, who is a master tuba player.
>Spanish moss hangs thick on huge trees in a dense forest.
>This part of the coast isn’t very urbanized, so right off the piers it’s just large forests of Oaks and Pines.
>Houses on stand on stilts at the edge of the river as you follow Captain Howard down winding girt roads.
>You gotta admit, this place is peaceful.
>Right by the water, far enough from civilization to allow freedom, and close enough to not have things be too inconvenient.
>Through the woods you follow the captain’s truck until it come to a stop in front of a large cabin.
>Well, it looks like a cabin, it has wooden paneling that look like logs, and a neon sign that reads "Smokey’s"
>Several other cars and trucks are parked around, no real spots are outlines so they just kinda park where ever they fit.
>Finding a nice small spot for your car, you park and get out, walking to the front door and meeting Captain Howard, who was able to get there first.
>"Here we are! best steaks this side o' the Mississippi, com'n lets introduce ya" he says with a broad friendly smile.
>"Ok Capta-" 
>"Aye no captain here, Just Howard." he cuts you off, holding open the door for you.
>The inside is a large single room that is barely lit; the smell of smoke from meat, smoke from cigars and beer fill the air.
>A pool table is to one side and there is a large bar where you can sit and eat
>"Ayeee Howard! How ya been? Who’s the new guy?" says a large bear behind the counter, an apron tied around his waist and a spatula in the large paw that he waves with.
>His words drip with a deep prideful southern accent.
>"Hey Smokey, been good, this is Anon, my new deckhand" Howard says, sitting at the bar.
>"Well com 'ere Anon, lets git a good look at'cha!" the very friendly bear says, waving you over.
>you walk over and extend a hand to Smokey, who looks at your hand then the rest of you.
"Sorry there fella, I’m cookin' and you been haulin' trash all day! Ain’t sanitary to go shakin' yer hand, No offense" he says both happily and matter of factly.
>Makes sense, even though you wash your hands constantly and wear thick gloves.
>"Well if yer a friend of Howard, yer welcome anytime!" he says with a final happy wiggle of his ears
>You head over to Howard and sit down, looking for a menu and don’t find one.
>"Uh, how do we order?" you ask Howard
>Smokey gives a solid laugh at your question, Dam that crazy good anthro hearing.
>"Hell he talks like a city boy! Ya get whatever happened to be caught or bought today! Today’s cut is venison!" he says, showing a rack of different cuts of meat.
>You nod and wait, while a waitress, a small Squirrel anthro brings you and Howard some beer.
>Smokey and Howard talk idly as the food is prepared, you drink down your first beer, then your second, and your third.
>What can you say? Its good beer!
>Smokey presents you and Howard both a large cut of Venison steak each, along with fries.
>"Here ya go newcomer! Enjoy"
>The smell alone makes your mouth water.
>You haven't really had good food for a while.
>Before you moved here, you were a literal starving artist, so you survived on ramen and cheap fast food.
>Feverishly, you dig in, rending the hot meat with you knife and teeth.
>"Whoa there Slick! It’s already dead and ain’t goin' anywhere!" Smokey says earnestly, eyeing you with surprise.
>He's right, you should savor this meal, so you nod to him, chewing the Medium rare meat slowly.
>The venison is Medium rare, and as you cut into drips grease and myoglobin, which looks like blood.
>The taste is exquisite, gamy and spiced to perfection.
>After you finish with the meat, you use the fries to soak up the liquid from the steak and dine on that.
>As you look up from your meal, you see Smokey smiling at you, a cigar in his mouth.
>"Ya like it?" he asks with a grin, although you're sure he already knows the answer.
>"Best steak I’ve ever had" you say as you grab a napkin.
>Probably best meal you've ever had too, but you didn't say that part.
>Howard claps you on the back heartily with his palm.
>"Told ya it’s the best" he says happily.
>You vaguely hear the door to the restaurant open behind you over the sound of the Jukebox.
>Howard and Smokey talk about local matters as you sip your beer, unsure of what they're talking about really.
>Noodling? What’s that?
>And people actually play Frisbee golf?
>Your semi drunk brain is having a hard time making sense of what they are saying through their thick accents.
>That is until you feel a heavy arm fall on your shoulder that makes you jump slightly.
>"Hey there Shuga, come here often" comes a bassy, feminine voice with a southern drawl.
>Looking up, you find the arm and presumably the voice, belong to a large Croc anthro.
>"If you're here I might just come by a lot more" you say, impressing yourself with how fast you came up with a good comeback.
>She gives a happily throaty laugh.
>"Well now ain’t chu fresher than a tuba toothpaste, I like you city boy" she says, sliding onto the barstool next to you.
>"Hey Izabella, see ya met my new Deckhand" Howard says as Izabella drapes an arm over your shoulder.
>"How many time do I gotta tell ya to just call me Bella?" Bella asks Howard, who just laughs.
>As the two converse about how the trash boat business is going, you study Bella over, although she still has an arm around you.
>She's tall, maybe 6'7, wearing a simple white tank top and blue jeans, along with a baseball cap with an orange or something on it.
>surprisingly, her Scales and body are all ivory white and a few tattoos of flowers dot her shoulders.
>Her thick tail scrapes along the floor and her large breasts seem like they don’t quite like the confines of the tank, as they seem to try to spill out of the low cut arm holes, with no bra in sight.
>You never knew why some reptiles had breasts, but you weren't going to question it as Bella has you pressed against hers.
>"Aww dammit, where's my manners, here I am chattin away and I ain’t learned my new friend’s name" Bella says with a short laugh.
>"What’s yer name there sweetheart?" She asks you with a toothy grin, her pink eyes watching you in an almost predatory manner.
>"Anon, nice to meet you Bella, may I get you a drink?" you say extending a hand for a handshake.
>For the second time you’re handshake is rejects, but this time you’re pulled into a bone crushing hug by the huge Croc.
>"Aww ain’t you just the Sweetest Thang! Course you can by Me a drink!" she says as she does so, planting you firmly between her breasts.
>It would be nice, except you can't quite breathe and that took away from your enjoyment thoroughly.
>When you're released from the crocs death hug, you're placed on the barstool facing Smokey, who has an amused smile on his face.
>"Never seen Izabella warm up to someone so quick, ya must be special city boy" he says as the small squirrel waitress, places 2 beers in front of you and Bella.
>You shrug.
>"Must be my city boy accent" you say, earning a chuckle from both Smokey and Bella. 
>Howard looks at his phone and frowns slightly.
>"Hey 'Non I gotta get goin' the wife needs me, you gonna be ok?" he asks, looking from you to Bella.
>"I’ll be fine, what time tomorrow?" you ask before sipping your drink.
>"Normal time, see ya" he answers then heads out.
>Bella gives you a quick wink when he leaves.
>"He's always been on a short leash ever since he married that Owl, soon as the sun's down he gets reeled in! Surprised it took her this long to get to him" she guffaws slightly, leaning her bulk against you.
>You check the time and frown as Smokey gives Bella a VERY rare cut of venison in a doggy bag.
>It is getting late, but you feel like you shouldn't drive after so many beers, so you pull out your phone and begin searching the internet for a cab company.
>"Whatcha lookin at city boy? Am I borin’ you?" Bella asks, peeking at your phone.
>"Lookin' for a cab Bella, I shouldn't drive and it’s late" you answer "Although I hate to leave a lovely lady like yourself all alone"
>Her eyes glint a bit in happiness and she grabs your hand roughly.
>"Aw Shuga if ya needed a ride you shoulda just asked me!" She says flirtatiously, pulling you out of your seat and upright
>"Smokey dear, will ya put it on my tab" Bella asks, as she half leads, half drags you out of the restaurant.
>A grunt of affirmation is all you hear as you follow Bella, trying your hardest not to step on her tail and not stare at her thick thighs and ass.
>You're lead to a lifted gray pick-up truck, and watch as Bella fishes in her cleavage for a moment, showing you much more of her impressive bust and pulls out a keyring.
>"Its good storage" she says mockingly when she see you looking, pushing her breasts together, straining the tank top further.
>You feel your face go red and look away, flustered at the flirty attitude of the Croc.
>She gives a happy bassy laugh and unlocks the truck and climbs in with more grace than you thought a lady her size could manage.
>"What ya need an invitation? Get in 'ere!" she calls out.
>You smile and climb into the truck as Bella adjusts her tail, getting it through a hole in the seat specially made for anthros.
>"Well now Mr. Anon, you haven’t told me where you live, but, my place is right around the corner, wanna stay there? I can Show you some good ol' Southern hospitality" she says, putting the doggy bag with her venison behind her seat.
>You think about it for a moment, you had just met this stunning albino crocodile yet she was offering you a lift to her place to spend the night?
>Were you ok with this?
>One of her hands running down your side tells you yes, you are ok with this.
>You gulp down your nervousness and keep your spaghetti in your pockets.
>"Sure Bella, I would love to" you say with a smile.
>Her eyes glint and she smiles back, showing off her impressive teeth.
>She starts driving down the dirt road in a calm, lazy manner, like she knows there is no need to rush
>"So tell me Anon, what makes a city boy like you come to a place like this?" She says, one hand on the wheel, the other snaking up and down your side.
>You shrug
>"Ran out of jobs in the city, was too stressed, so I just came down here where I can work an honest job and not be stressed about it" you say and you gingerly creep your hand to Bella's thick thigh.
>You study her for a moment seeing if she dislikes it, but only get her hand being a bit more adventurous on your side
>"And you work on a trash boat? Why not a shrimp boat like me?" she asks, her cool hand sliding under your shirt and feeling your skin.
"Ooo you are a warm one" she murmurs absentmindedly.
>You don’t react to those words, instead choosing to squeeze her thigh a bit and answer her questions.
>"It was the first job I could find, and shrimp are seasonal right? There no seasonal garbage migrations" you say calmly
>Cautiously she pulls her hand away from your side, grabs your hand then places it on her breast.
>"If you’re gonna squeeze somethin, why not these? After all you been eyein me since we met" she says, pressing your hand firmly into the supple flesh of her chest.
>You feel your face redden, but don't remove your hand.
>"You sure?" 
>She gives a slow nod of approval.
>It had been a long LONG time since you gotten with any women, human or anthro; you weren't ugly or super awkward, things just didn’t work out most of the time.
>College had been a fun time, party girls always were kind of fun to mess around with but you could never land a solid steady relationship.
>All that nonsense is firmly as you gently begin to knead and squeeze her breast, since you can only reach one of them, earning gasps of pleasure.
>Bella drives the truck slowly through a small stream, which tells you why she has a lifted truck.
>She places her free hand back on you and creeps is down your side, adventuring dangerously close to your crotch.
>"What cup size are you Bella? Your tits are amazing" you ask as you feel out her nipple through her tank top, only partly though.
>"And are those inverted Nipples I feel?"
>This time it’s her turn to blush.
>"46F, that’s why I don't have a bra on, too hard to find and they get messed up by my scales" she answers, still looking at the road and driving one handed.
>Her other hand is working at the snap on your pants, and gets it unclasped with a slight *click*.
>She then slowly pushes your underwear down and pulls your erection free.
>"Ohh Big" She moans slowly as you reach a hand through the low cut arm hole of her tank top and feel the soft scales of her underbelly.
>She pulls her hand back, then looks at you with a side eye, then opens her large mouth and licks her palm generously and sensually with her long tongue.
>You recall that feral crocs don't have tongues, but as you watch Bella, you don't care much about anatomy.
>Her eyes focus back on the road, and her hand wraps around your member, coating it with warm viscous saliva.
>Gently she pumps her hand up and down, as you tease her breast and pinch her nipple gently.
>Her rhythm is slow and steady, each time her hand reaches you tip, her thumb gently rubs it, sending shivers of pleasure up your spine.
>"Ooo you're so warm" Bella moans happily.
>The truck come to a halt in front of a cozy house raised up on stilts, right next to a river that was flowing pleasantly.
>The house looked like it was about 70 years old and was well taken care of, a single lamp glowed next to a door at the top of a staircase.
>"Let’s continue this inside why don't we?" Bella cooes as she gently gives a few more pumps with her hand before she releases your now soaked shaft.
>With that, she then jumps out of the truck and walks briskly to her front door.
>After a little effort, you're able to push your erection down into your jeans and follow her.
>She's already in the house when you get to the foot of the stairs.
>God damn, she's fast.
>You climb the stairs quickly, trying to get up them as fast as possible without falling.
>The front door is open and there is no lights on inside, which makes you pause.
>Something was fishy, but your hormone addled brain tells you it’s just Bella trying to set the mood.
>"Come on City boy~" you hear Bella's sultry deep voice echo out of the darkness.
>Well fuck it, bottoms up and all that nonsense.
>You walking the house and look around blindly, walking in slowly.
>"Bella?" you call into the darkness, you feel along the wall for a switch and find one, and flick it upwards.
>As soon as the light's on, a white blur hurtles into you, picks you up bodily and tosses you onto a large plush couch.
>"Didn't you know crocodiles are ambush predators?" Bella chimes, jumping onto you and pinning you to the couch "And I just found my prey"
>Somehow in the span of her entering the house and you entering it, she had taken off all her clothes and is now pinning you with ease.
>"Somethin about you just gets me ALLLL riled up City boy" She moans casually, as she sits up and straddles you.
>Her hands gently slide under your shirt 
>"Mmmm so warm~" she cooes, rubbing your skin with her scaled fingers.
>You in turn slide your hands over her body, savoring the cool feeling of her tough back scales and her smooth underbelly.
>Without another word, she tugs you shirt upwards, pulling your arms away from her body; and like that, the shirt is off you and tossed into some corner of her house.
>the large Croc slides down your body, unbuttons your pants once more and in a flash you’re naked, with her having pulled off your underwear too.
>You're at full mast and Bella eyes your member hungrily.
>"Ever gotten a blowjob from a predator like me?" she asks smoothly, her nostril flaring a bit before opening her mouth.
>It’s a giant maw of teeth, with her long pink tongue lazily sliding back and forth in it.
>"Uh n-no" you stammer out, watching those teeth fearfully.
>"Well you aren't ever going to! But you will get this" she says before turning and laying her head flat against you, so that her upper jaw and lower jaw were around your member.
>If she wanted she could just chomp down and-
>And what you feel instead is a long wet tongue wrap gracefully around your shaft
>The sudden pleasure makes you jump slightly, earning a guttural laugh from Bella as she licks and slurps happily.
>Holy fuck, shes giving you you a tonguejob.
>Her tongue is hot and strong, rolling up and down your member.
>The length of it mainly focuses on your shaft while the tip of her tongue does small circles on your sensitive head.
>She has amazing control as she caresses and slides it up and down, feeling so much better than her hand job in the car.
>The wetness and softness of her mouth is a stark contrast to her thick scales.
>She lifts her head slightly and pulls her tongue from your shaft.
>"Tastes good city boy, ready for more?" she says as she slide down onto her knees in front of the couch, pulling you so your sitting in front of her.
>Her large breasts, each the size of small watermelons, are perky and have a slight pinkish shade around her inverted nipples, are on either side of your throbbing member.
>Without another word she squeezes them together, slowly pumping her large breasts up and down.
>Your member slides between them with ease, her slick scales and her saliva aiding in the slippery up-down motion.
>You move your hands forwards, grabbing each breast and help move them gently, adding more warmth and pressure as Bella licks the tip of your engorged member, lapping at any pre-cum that comes out.
>Bella lets go of her breasts and begins pinching and pulling her nipples as you guide her breasts, alternating between straight up and down, to moving one up and the other down.
>You begin speeding up the rhythm, pushing her breasts together tighter around your member and bringing them down with more force.
>A solid wet *Plap* sound is made each time her scaly breasts hit your pelvis, and one of Bella’s hands disappear between her legs.
>Her moans tell you exactly what she’s doing, while her tongue continues licking tiny circles around the tip of you throbbing member.
>The pressure from her breasts and the precise feeling of that tongue tip send waves of pleasure through you.
>You grunt in pleasure as you feel you limit coming.
>Thrusting up as you bring her breasts down, you buck wildly into her chest and in between those giant mounds of pleasure
>"B-Bella I’m gonna cum" you stammer out, moving her breasts more erratically then before as the waves of pleasure threatened to drown you in them.
>Her licks stop and she opens her maw, with the words "Give it to me"
>With on last final thrust and an extra loud "PLAP," you spray your seed into Bella's eagerly waiting mouth.
>Her tongue circles around the inside of her mouth, collecting it all before she swallows.
>"Mmmm" she moans as she opens her mouth once more.
>You feel your legs shudder and shiver as her tongue laps at the tip of your semi erect member, still sandwiched between her breasts.
>"H-holy fuck" you gasp as her tongue glides gently on your over sensitive shaft.
>"Just making sure you’re ready for round 2" Bella chides calmly, her fingers still between her legs as she licks you softly.
>Hearing her moans as she continues cleaning your semi erect member, well it makes it into a fully erect member.
>"There we go" Bella moans, giving your shaft the equivalent of a kiss.
>She stands up to her full impressive height and then sits next to you on the couch, suddenly a bit bashful.
>"Bella? What’s wrong" you say, putting an arm around her and pulling her closer.
>She gives you a wry smile and then takes a hold of your hand, interlocking her fingers in yours.
>"I uh, I’ve never done this before, I’ve always been so busy with work and-" you silence her with a kiss which on the end of her long snout.
>"I’ll take the lead then" you say, slowly directing her body with your hand.
>"I'm sure you've watched porn before, get on your hands and knees and we'll go slow ok?" you reassure her.
>She nods and presents her soaked nethers to you, her thick strong tail raised, and her asshole quivering slightly.
>You position yourself behind her, gently rubbing her soaked lips with the tip, and her tail over your shoulder.
>"I’m gonna push in slowly ok?" you say with a questioning prod.
>"O-ok" she says with a small nod.
>Slowly, you push into the wetness of her folds and can feel the muscles of her lips quiver as you do.
>If those muscles are as strong as the rest of her, you were in for a wild night.
>She gasps a bit in surprise, making those muscle tighten a bit.
>"You OK?" you ask, stopping.
>"Mhm, it's just bigger than I thought it would feel" she moans, pushing herself back towards you.
>Taking it as a sign she’s alright, you resume pushing into her until you’re at the base and feel her wetness on your pelvis.
>Her insides are hot, hotter than you thought they had any right to be, and tight; for a gal her size tighter than it would be.
>She did say she was a virgin more or less though.
>"I'm gonna start moving" you say, wrapping one arm around her thick tail and placing your other hand on her plump ass.
>A pleasure filled "Mhm" is your only response.
>Slowly, you begin moving, thrusting slowing into her wet slit and earning more and more pleasure filled moans
>She tightens her muscles with each thrust probably out of instinct rather than trying to give you more pleasure.
>The pleasure comes anyway, as she begins matching your rhythm and gasping
>The wetness from her only increases as you keep thrusting, and squeezing her ass.
>Her ragged moans of pleasure turn into gasps, and the tightness of her insides only increase as you plant a hearty slap on her ass.
>"Mmmm! Do it again and pull my tail!" She moans, her legs quivering against yours.
>You spank her again, harder this time, and give her tail a yank, pulling the tail and her with it right as you thrust outward into her.
>The resulting clamp like feeling from her muscle lined walls is intense as she gives a hearty "Ah" 
>Using her tail to pull her big ass to your pelvis, you're able to thrust even deeper into her.
>The loud sound of "Plap" fills the room again as Bella’s gasps descend into simple whimpers of pleasure.
>Her arms give out from supporting her heavy frame and she falls forwards, her breasts pressed into the couch.
>Her muscles contract sharply with ever tail pull and every spank.
>The pleasure sends shivers up and down your spine as you feel the quivering walls start to shutter.
>"A-anon I'm g-gonna cum, D-don't stop" Bella moans almost drunkenly.
>You redouble your efforts, pulling harder and thrusting deeper until Bella gives a deep pleasure filled moan and you feel a flush of liquid hit your thighs and soak her coach.
>As she cums, her muscles clamp down and shake, legs and tail spasming slightly
>Without missing a beat, you continue your onslaught, determined to find that blissful release as well.
>The stimulation of her tremors and the constant shivers, along with the tightness that came with her orgasm push you ever closer to your climax.
>"B-Bella! I-I’m gonna cum" you gasp out, Spanking her as hard as you get another tight quiver of muscle
>"F-Fill me! Make me your!" Bella gasps
>You give a few determined hearty thrusts, more than willing to give her lusty seductress exactly what she wanted.
>Then with one last deep thrust, you unload everything you have left into her with a deep satisfied groan.
>The two of you stay in this position for a while, tired from the deed but immeasurably happy.
>You can feel Bella's coiling muscles still trying to get more out of you as you slide out of her slowly and then collapse on the couch next to her.
>"I’ve never squirted before" she says with a toothy grin "good job"
>You chuckle a little, and run a hand down her face.
>"That was amazing Bella, you sure you haven't done this before?" you tease, a smile on your face.
>She gives a gentle little hit to your arm with her grin getting bigger.
>"Yea I'm sure" She says happily, then nuzzles her large snout into your neck.
>You see her rubbing her tummy slightly and hear her murmur "Warm".
>The two of you bask in the afterglow for a bit before Bella gives a slight shiver.
>"Its cold city boy, why don't we go to the actual bedroom and snuggle under some covers?" she says rising from the couch and noting the wet spot on her couch.
>You nod and raise, then follow the gorgeous reptile to her bedroom.
>She slides into the bed and you follow.
>"I’m gonna be the little spoon" Bella says matter of factly turning away from you.
>You smile and snuggle up next to her and pull the covers over the two of you.
>Before long you hear the gentle rumbling of Bella's light snores
>One last thought crosses your mind as you drift off to sleep yourself.
>Maybe not EVERYTHING in the Bayou is that bad.
>And it turns out crocodiles rock.
