>after a long drive and much threatening to turn this car around you finally made it
"We're home!"
>bailey almost falls out the door in her mad dash to get out
>coco on the other hand was gone like a lightning bolt
>down the driveway, up the steps and had to brace herself to prevent slamming into the door, which she started happily bouncing in front of while she waited on you 2 to get there
>the house was originally supposed to be a summer home for your friends well off parents but they lost interest in it and decided to rent it to you for cheap
>besides the omnipresent mosquitoes (thankful none of the anthro variety), the cranky old neighbors and the giant windows making sure you only had privacy by virtue of how out of the way this place was, you don't know why they'd didn't want to deal with it anymore
>Oh, it was also on the edge of a lake, so that was nice
>you made your way to front door with bailey trailing behind and coco shouting impatiently for you to hurry up
"Oh I can't wait to see and smell all of masters stuff! Do you have a TV?"
>as you reach the door you tell coco you do in fact have a TV and she takes the opportunity to give you another big hug
>you've since realized that all this hugging is just an excuse to smell your clothes
"Coco, If you don't let me go I won't be able to unlock the door"
"Oh, sorry!"
>she steps aside to finally let you at the door
>since this will be their home from now on you decide to make a show of it, slowing turning the key, then giving the same treatment to the knob before bombastically throwing open the door and shouting
"Welcome to your new home girls!"
>As expected coco is the first to run in while you waited for bailey to more cautiously make her way into the rather featureless hallway entrance
>the first thing either of them saw was 2 doors on the left, 1 to your bedroom the other to your bathroom, before turning the corner when coco said
"Oh wow master your living room is so big!"
>thats only because your living room was also your kitchen
>it still had all the amenities of a living room, sofa, recliner, coffee table and wall mounted TV
>no kitchen table or chairs tho
>tucked along the back wall was everything needed to serve as a kitchen
>fridge, stove, microwave and pantry
>you were reminded of trying to figure out how you were going to feed these girls
>but then coco loudly flopped herself onto the sofa snapping you out of your thoughts
>you had a blanket laying the sofa which coco eagerly took the opportunity to take big deep sniffs of
"hmmmm, It smells like you master"
>she rolled over onto her back with the blanket covering her face while bailey seemed to take more interest in the recliner 
>the first thing was curl into a ball and snuggle into the seat
>she looked like she had been made to fit into that chair
>once she was satisfied by the chairs comfiness she stretched herself out reclined in it
>now with both your pets on their backs with their tummies dangerously exposed you go in for the attack
>with lightning quick reflexes you reach over both of them and start softly scratching around their bellybuttons
>bailey gives a brief meow of surprise before arching her back and purring in pleasure
>coco stops her sniffing to peak out from under the blanket and begins wagging her tail at a million miles a minute
>but in their pleasure they seem to have accidentally expose another part of themselves that had been previously hidden from you
>once again your alternative motive begins to surface  
>bailey has spread her legs wide, totally exposing herself to your hungry eyes
>her pussy is surprisingly similar to a minimalistic human girls if it wasn't for the slightly darkened fur around it or the slightly more prominent clit
>but the most striking detail is how small and tight it is
>even just looking at it you can tell you'd have trouble fitting your pinkie inside, let alone your dick 
>with your curiosity peeked you move your eyes over to coco and she immediately meets your gaze
>she looks down at your hand and then back up to you as if asking you to scratch her lower
>you look down on her and she has totally exposed herself just like bailey
>her tails seems to wag slower as your eyes focus on her cunt
>it's more dissimilar to a humans than baileys is
>her fur parts way around it leaving totally hairless down there, her lips are much thicker than a humans and her clitoral hood has a slight point to it but still maintains a human shape rather than the triangular appearance of a ferals
>you better put an end to this before you commit a crime
>you stop scratching them and walk in front of the coffee table
>bailey gives you an appreciative smile while coco looks more disappointed
>the red glow of the sunset begins to make it's way through the window
>You clear your throat
"So I'm glad you girls are settling yourselfs in, but it's getting late and we've had a long day"
"So whats the first thing you want to in your new home before bedtime?"
