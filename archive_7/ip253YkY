>Raine wakes up one morning 
>Brain function at 3%
>Get's coffee from table and heads out
>Still early morning 
>Only person she came across was that one basitin Karen always hung out with
>She seemed flustered about something
>Ankles probably weren't covered
>Raine made her way sleepily to Red's room
>He said they'd go to a theater performance in Edinmire
>And that she should come get him
>Or he'd come get her... one of the two
>Was it in the morning or late in the evening?
>Didn't really matter, they'd make it either way
>Upon reaching his door she knocked softly, making sure to not wake anyone else up in the process
>She heard something stir inside: "Mmmhhullo?"
>"It's me... are you not out of bed yet?"
>"Come in."
>Upon entering she noticed the human had buried his face in pillows
>She walked over and placed her barely touched coffee on the bedside table
>She rubbed his shoulder to try and get him to wake up a bit
>"Didn't you say you were going to take me to the theater today?"
>He started to spin around
>"Raine, that's at six PM, not six aaaaiiieee-whoa."
>His eyes started shifting all over her body until finally resting on her panties
>Raine looked down and saw she never got changed out of the lingerie 
>She'd tested it out the night before, it was supposed to be for after the theater
>"H-heheh, looks like that's not the only thing I mixed up"
>"Damn, you look... hot"
>She started rubbing her hair, "Thanks, it was supposed to be a surprise for... afterwards."
>"I mean now is fine!"
>"Snrk, you can wait mister."
>He had finally leaned up and wrapped his hands just above her hips
>He gave them a small squeeze "How about a little teaser? We don't even have to get undressed."
>Raine felt her keidran side coming out a bit more
>It was what made her dress this way in the first place
>"I spoil you too much, you know that?"
>He stuck his tongue out a little as he eyed a growing wet spot on her panties "Probably."
>The human had helped her onto his bed, she was still a little nervous whenever they fooled around
>She was pulled on top of him, the wet spot smearing her arousal all over his chest
>It wasn't until he pulled her hips towards his head now resting on a pillow did she understand what he wanted to do
>So she lifted her tail up and leaned down to find that his underwear was poorly hiding his thick manhood
>She practically jumped when she felt his tongue press into the fabric separating her pussy from his loving mouth
>It felt like she was being teased but still being pleasured as the tongue lapped at her covered folds
>She took to licking at his member through his heart printed boxers
>She could feel him pulse at her large canine tongue with each stroke
>He kept running his fingers under her panties' waistband 
>It was driving her crazy
>She wanted to feel more of his tongue
>She wanted to taste more of him
>After placing a couple kisses on his concealed tip she unbuttoned the slit in his underwear
>And brought his head through it and in between her canines
>She knew it was his favorite place in her extended mouth, even if he refused to admit it
>He decided to return her treatment 
>Using his own teeth, he pulled the panties aside and returned his treatment of her now soaked sex
>He gave his unrelenting focus onto her now puffy wolf pussy
>Thanks to the teasing through clothes, both of them were getting close 
>Red felt his climax quickly building 
>But he knew how to speed her up just like she'd done to him
>He brought his hands from her waistband and lifted them up to her raised tail
>His dexterous hands gently worked the spinal extension
>She spasmed and happily moaned at the amazing feeling
>And right before she came
>He quickly wrapped his hands around her hips and pulled them close 
>So he could stick his tongue as deep insider of her as he could
>That's all she could take
>She rode her orgasm as she suddenly found thick ropes of cum now shooting into her mouth and right onto her tongue
>She swallowed and sucked a little more, making sure to not waist the salty treat
>Their afterglow hit them hard as they began to come down from their high
>Raine flopped his now flaccid manhood back into his underpants and slipped her panties back into place 
>She took her place next to the now dopey human, she was exhausted 
>"Enjoy your teaser?"
>"Yeah, though, I really don't want to get out of bed now."
>"Heh, well, so long as we don't sleep past six right?"
>"Wait, is it even Friday?
>...
>It's Thursday isn't it?"
>"... I am off the ball today."
>"It ain't all bad" he said while pulling her close
>Raine's ears suddenly perked up
>"Shoot!"
>"What?"
>"I think my coffee's gone cold."
