You are Papa Bear

Anon had been in this hospital bed for probably an hour before he considered why he should be in a hospital bed when he fell asleep in his dingy bed in his dingy apartment.
He had fiddled with the bed remote a couple of times and pressed a button he assumed could get a hold of someone, all the while watching the crappy tube tv in the corner.
It.. unnerved him, to say the least.
It was playing some sort of game show with a huge wheel of prizes 
everything seemed pretty close to normal -  except for the fact that the host was a giant fucking turtle.
No one in the audience, not even the middle aged mom with the name tag ‘Beth’, seemed to acknowledge this fact - in the audience, he swore he saw a couple of other animal creatures sitting next to humans like it was no big deal. Even when she screamed after winning a jackpot (good for you, Beth) causing the turtle to retreat into his shell.
Weird.
“You’re awake!”
Anon lazily shifted his eyes from the telly to a source of noise emanating from the doorway - where a MASSIVE hammerhead shark woman in a loose-fitting nurses outfit looked at him in shock. She takes up the entire doorway, so escape is impossible.
Quick - think of something clever to say:
“Yup.”
Before he could ask anything else, she ran down the hallway shouting something he couldn’t hear. Weird.
Maybe she was going to get his family or friends or other people who he knew would never visit him in the hospital. If he hadn’t seen the television, he would have assumed that the nurse ran off to alert government scientists that they could finally dissect their patient awake - but he wasn’t the odd man out, he was just a regular human in a hospital with shark nurses and turtle-Steve Harvey on cable. 
He really didn’t know what to make of it, whether he had been flung into some reality where giant animal people live side by side with humans (or maybe as their pets) or if this was some not-particularly-funny joke.
*thump thump thump*
The shark lady was coming back, maybe to give him morphine, and it seemed like she wasn’t alone. Anon heard little voices chatting to each other, almost sounding like children. As they seemingly ran towards his room.
--
In the doorway, stood a bear… person.
It was a bit hard to see with the bright lights, but Anon was able to make out her light brown coat of fur that looked a bit matted in some places. She had darker chestnut brown hair pulled into a messy bun between the cute little ears on the top of her head.
She was dressed in a light green sweater and a pair of mom jeans that hugged her curves. Even from far away, he could see her impressive bust and wide hips. Plus a cute necklace he couldn’t make out the shape of - maybe a heart?
She was a head smaller than the shark nurse, but definitely still taller than Anon.
And she was also looking right at him.
With more time for his eyes to focus, he saw her dark green eyes boring into his, her paws fidgeting with a small yellow purse. They looked sharp.
Once he noticed her eyes were solely on him, Anon found himself caught like a deer in the headlights of a gigantic bear-woman
“A-anon!”
In an instant, the bear woman ran over to his hospital bed, capturing him in (an admittedly comfy) bear hug. Her claws that looked so sharp a moment ago ran gently through his hair, big furry paws encapsulating his head. She would rub her cold snout against the top of his head, embarrassing him slightly due to how sweaty his hair was, and peppering in little smooches on his ears and forehead.
It felt nice.
Anon, for his part, was facefirst with this incredibly affectionate bear woman’s ample cleavage through the thin material of her sweater. He wanted to ask what was happening, but the velvety softness this lady was pushing him against felt nice enough to cause him to not complain. That heart shaped necklace she was wearing kept getting in his mouth, though.
She then softly put her paws underneath Anon’s head, putting them face to face.
He noticed the more cream colored fur on her muzzle, matted down with tears both old and new, her thick eyebrows knitted in concern. 
“T-they-they said you might not wake up,” she said, her warm breath hitting his face like a dream “I-I-I,” she babbled, before breaking into sobs. Anon knew to comfort a crying lady, returning her hug and softly running his hands over the expanse of her back. She sobbed into his neck. He cooed softly, giving gentle kisses of his own. Only fair.
“Dad!”
Dad?
Anon heard more footsteps run behind this nice but sad bear-lady, feeling another set of hands on his arm.
As the comfy one moved away from hugging him, he saw two little bear children standing close to their bear mom, all looking at Anon.
He wasn’t able to tell how old or even what gender the pair were, just a distinct enough age difference. The older-looking seemed like a teenage boy based on the fashion sense, the younger looking like an elementary school student. The momma bear moved closer to his side and he was quickly attacked by two little bear-gremlins, grabbing his arm and leg.
In quick succession, he heard the two kids yell things to the effect of “we thought you were DEAD, dad” and “did you meet grandma Jo?” before the shark nurse made a comment about giving him some space.
With enough room, he took in the sights of three animal people gathered around his bedside giving him expectant stares.
“Momma Bear,” Anon spoke, gesturing to the nice woman. 
“Bear Children,” he remarked to the two at his other side.
“I think you might have confused me with somebody else.”
---
Afterwards everything seemed pretty tense. The bear woman asked the nurse to take care of the kids. Both kids leave with the shark without a word, closing the door behind them.
Anon looks up curiously at this towering woman. This might not be the time, but wow is she his type to a tee. The furs not something he had in mind, though
“Honey,” she spoke slowly, “can you remember my name?”
He looked at her, then at the floor, then at her purple nails clacking away against her purse.
“I- I can’t,” he said, “I’m not sure of it, but I.. don’t think we’ve met before.”
This was definitely the wrong answer, because she immediately started sobbing, before collapsing into the chair behind her.
Anon looks on in bewilderment as she folds into herself with tears, not even bothering to look at him anymore.
He looks down, before noticing a box of tissues on his bedside table. Picking out a couple, Anon reaches over to this beautiful bear lady and taps her on the shoulder. She looks up cautiously, seeing his peace offering, and gently takes them within her delicate claws.
Anon get up to move out of his seat-
“Oh no no, you shouldn’t get out of bed,” she whispers.
He looks into her eyes
“Then move a little closer,” he whispers back.
She smiles an uneasy smile, scooting the too-tiny-for-her chair over to him.
Anon uses a good deal of his strength to lean his frame against her soft fuzzy arm, wrapping an arm around her.
Holy shit is she soft!
They both stay like that for a while, him whispering more sweet nothings into her ear.

Chapter 2, I Guess?
-
Her name was Susan
Anon had learned that in a very quick debriefing by Susan after they cuddled in the hospital room. She had eventually paged the nurse, returning with the two bear children.
His bear children.
He hadn’t exactly been told this, but Anon assumed they were from a previous marriage - They had to be, he was way too young to be the father of anything old enough to speak.
Also he wasn’t a bear.
He mostly thought about that on the car ride back.
Things were a little tense in Susan’s huge four-door sedan
Silence was punctuated by the teenage bear in the back clacked his nails on his smartphone
The smaller one kept kicking the back of Anon’s seat in a pretty consistent rhythm.
He found it strangely relaxing.
“Myra,” Susan said, not averting her gaze from the road “stop kicking your father’s seat/”
Father. This was so weird
She grumbled, whipping out her phone and typing like her brother
---
MYRA: he didn’t even yell at me
Read, 10:30pm
MYRA: hey
JACOB: wht
MYRA:read above
JACOB: what about it
MYRA: do you even care?

Back in Anon’s world, he was looking at the sights of his little town at night.
Everything seemed the same - same old cash4gold signs, fast food conglomerates - but he could definitely see a lot of the people weren’t human at all. Some were, most weren’t though
He would probably be scared shitless if Susan hadn’t grabbed his hand at some point.
Hers was naturally much bigger than his, but she kept a firm grip, fingers intertwined.
The soft pads of her fluffy hands felt nice.
Oh, she just asked him something
“What?”
Now it felt like all eyes were on him
“I asked if you wanted your window rolled up?”
He nodded.
The cool air felt nice

They pulled into a cul-de-sac Anon had never been to before, but then again they were pretty much all the same.
The driveway, his driveway he guessed, was pretty long and stretched into the woods -
Leading to a cozy little cabin. It was fuckall big.
Susan offered to carry him upon pulling into the garage. He declined, shuffling onto his unsteady feet.
The kids had already scooted by and headed inside.
Though he noticed the girl stopped at the doorway, pausing and looking back at him for a minute before following her brother.
He felt a fluffy hand on his shoulder.
Looking up, he saw Susan had let her hair down and was giving him a shy smile.
“Hiya,” he said with a similar smile.
She snorted out a laugh and gently pushed him towards the garage door.
The house was huge - it had to be to account for a family of bears and an Anon. Nicely furnished with the odd sort of tribal furnishing and warmly lit. The kids had already raced upstairs.
Everything’s real cozy
Again he heard a laugh
Did he say that out loud?
“Go have a seat on the couch, I’ll bust out some pizza we got while you were…” she trailed off and headed into the kitchen
Anon followed her instructions and found a huge couch situated in front of a respectable flatscreen. This was a ton nicer than his dingy apartment - he didn’t even own a tv.
The couch was suitably soft.
In no time, Susan returned with two plates of reheated pizza (his favorite) and a dr pepper. Guess they were sharing it.
Sitting down next to him, she immediately caused the cushion to fly him into her soft side.
She laughed, putting the pizzas down on a coffee table and offered him a drink; something he took with great pleasure.
“The doctor said that we should try memory exercises at the same time each night in order to, I don’t know, jog your memory - is that alright with you, dear?”
“Of course,” Anon responded between sips. He felt a hand on his back.
“What’s your name?”
“Anon.”
“What’s mine?”
“Susan.” 
She smiled at that.
“How about the cubs upstairs?”
“Myra, and…”
“Jacob,” she started rubbing his back “how long have we been married?”
“I… I don’t know.”
She sighed, taking the soda from him and chugging a bit.
“Six years, as of a week ago,” her vision got glassy, and she started to wipe away the tears in her eyes. “We were on an anniversary dinner, and- oh dear, you slipped and busted your head open.”
Anon, a clutz who ruins any and all nice things? Who’d have guessed.
“How long was I out? A week?”
She leaned back, placing an arm over the couch by his side, sighing as she leaned more into the cushy couch.
“About - The cubs and I visited you every day after they got out of school, even when your situation looked worse and worse. But, you’re back on your feet! Even if you can’t remember anything.”
Anon bit his cheek, feeling bad even when he wasn’t to blame - this other Anon with at least six years of experience on him and enough charm to woo a lovely bear lady had monumentally fucked up by putting this other Anon in charge. 
“How’re you feeling?” Susan asked,
None of this felt real, even when he looked at the framed photos of Anon and his bear family at Disneyworld, waterparks, and other slices of a life he hadn’t taken part in. But this other Anon looked really happy, and his family looked really happy with him.
Now he felt bad, like he was playing a part.
“I’m… frustrated, I guess. I feel like I should remember all of this, you, the house, the kids. It feels like I’ve just lost however many years of my life in a second.”
He didn’t even notice that Susan had gingerly put her arm around him, holding him rather tight.
“When we first met,” Susan began “you were in a bit of a rut.”
That’s a nice way to put the existential dread he felt pretty much all the time. Before he slipped through the cracks of reality and ended up wherever he was now.
“I was too - I hardly ever went out, I couldn’t make conversation with anyone, time slipped away from me. My oldest daughter - she’s in college now, maybe she can come down for a visit - she installed one of those dating apps. Almost all of the men on there were jackasses, I had a lot of hurtful comments sent my way over my children… but then I saw the profile of this striking younger gentleman - one thing led to another and here we are.”
He thinks for a minute.
“The kids-“
“All three are from a previous marriage. We’ve been separated for almost a decade.” She took a bit of her pizza, cheese strands connecting to her muzzle. 
“They love you, by the way,” the bear spoke after a moment “Caroline’s a little shy, but she’s warming up.”
“Oh.”
Three bear children, one in college.
“This is a little weird,” slipped out of his mouth.
Susan started laughing though,
Score one for hubby.
That was also weird.
