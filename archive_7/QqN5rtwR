>You peek down the alley behind the bar, the dim light of the marquee sign casting a red glow that doesn't quite reach all the way to the furthest wall
>"Come on. Don't be a pussy," urges your friend who seems more nervous than you
>Fuck it, you think, this is probably all horseshit anyhow
>You walk down the alley, trying to hide your nerves, stepping around a suspicious pool of liquid on the ground
>You reach the wall at the end
>Nothing but garbage bags and random debris
>Well, you did your part. Now they'll stop calling you chicken
>"Why, hello there, cutie"
>You turn and almost lose your balance trying to find the source of the voice
>You spot her leaning against the wall just behind a dumpster, hiding in the shadows
>She takes a step forward into the light, revealing herself as a fox on the prowl
>She's wearing a pilot's uniform without any rank or other identifier
>Her appearance is half-way between that stern, serious look of a solider and the laid back, deceptively casual air of a bounty hunter or mercenary
>She looks middle-aged but with a youthful excitement on her face
>Moving past you, a seductive swaying to her hips, she lets her bushy tail brush against your waist just above your crotch
>She pushes a burnt-out barrel aside and swings open a plywood panel
>There's a small crawlspace behind it, leading into darkness
>She looks at you with a wide grin
>"Get in, won't you?"

>You look back toward your friend
>He's fucking gone
>Of course he is, he barely had the courage to follow you to the bar
>This is the lowest circle of the station - you really, really shouldn't be here
>"Are you going to make me beg for it?" she asks coyly
>Moving closer to you with teasingly slow steps, she draws herself up to her full height so she can look down on you
>"Or are you hoping I'd simply take what I want, without waiting for permission?"
>You feel a chill down your spine and a sudden tension in your stomach at her words
>You had let them talk you into it because of that stupid rumor: "When the Black Hawks were docked, at least one of them would often hang around The Derelict, looking for virgins to bed"
>As if anyone from above - let alone a virgin - would randomly wander down here, risking to get mugged, beaten or worse
>Well... Maybe... If they had heard the rumor, that is. Like you have...
>She suddenly grabs you around the waist with one hand and pulls you close, the other hand going around your neck, pressing your face against the leathery texture of her jacket
>You can feel a distinct softness just beneath the fabric as she holds you still with surprising strength
>"I guess I have my answer," she whispers into your ear, a light smell of alcohol reaching your nose
>"Don't worry, baby. Just leave it all to me. You will soon feel oh-so-much better..."
>She slowly walks backward with her arms still around you, and you have no choice but to follow, trying your best not to stumble or step on her feet
>As her back bumps into the wall she draws you in closer again, leaning down so her muzzle's right next to your face
>She opens her mouth, her fangs gleaming pink in the neon light, her hot breath washes over your face
>"Now, be a good boy and squeeze yourself inside~"

>She lets you go, motions toward the opening behind the plywood panel with a stern finger, as if ordering a young cadet
>You hesitate, consider running away, but wonder if at this point she'd even let you
>Perhaps... Perhaps it's better to play along... Yes, it might be safer that way...
>You look at the opening, excitement and fear racing through your mind as you crouch down and enter the crawlspace
>It's larger than the lack of lighting lead you to believe, but you can't stand up
>Moving awkwardly, with your hands on the walls, you feel your way forward as the dim light of the alley fades behind you
>Suddenly the room opens up to the sides, and you nearly fall forward
>You steady yourself with your hands, feeling something soft underneath you
>A pillow? Mattress? It's too dark to tell
>You take another trying step, reach out and feel something else
>Something much softer, and much more inviting
>"Oh, my, aren't you the eager one"
>It's not the same voice as before
>"Yes, I think this one should last us all night"
>Oh, fuck - there's two of them!
>A light comes on and you see a wolf in front of you, naked from the waist up, with a half-empty bottle of a semi-transparent orange liquid - alcohol by the smell of it
>You pull your hand back from her breast, and she looks almost insulted before a wild expression takes over her face
>She leans toward you, hunger in her eyes
>You try to take a step back but the fox from earlier blocks your escape
>"It's too late for that, don't you think?"
>"Much too late," the wolf answers, getting up on her knees and moving toward you

>You freeze, caught between a rock and a hard place, as you stare into the hungry eyes of the wolf approaching you, her naked breasts swaying with every unsteady step
>Even the softness of the fox's body against your back, or her hot breath against the back of your neck, can't calm your nerves
>Some part of you had always wanted the rumor to be true, hoping that you'd find a beautiful woman here, ready and willing to show you the ropes
>Not that these two weren't beautiful, despite - or perhaps because of - their age, and they certainly seemed willing to show you a thing or two
>But to be completely at their mercy, unable to escape and with no hope of rescue, wasn't how you had pictured it
>You knew your friend would be long gone by now, up in the residential area of the top circles, and that he'd be too scared to share with anyone where the two of you had been
>The fox slide her hands around your waist and nuzzles your hair, drawing deep inhales of your smell between panting exhales that make the hairs on the back of your neck rise
>You were on your own
>The wolf is standing on her knees with her face right in front of yours, tongue hanging out, and her breasts jiggling from her quick breaths
>Your only hope was that they'd let you go once they were done with you
>The smell of alcohol is getting to you, mixing with your fears and clouding your mind, until all you can do is stare into her bright orange eyes
>If they'd ever be done with you, that is...
>"It's my time to go first, right?" the wolf asks, her voice low and husky as a devilish smile spreads on her lips
>"Hm? Was it, now?" comes the answer from behind, low and drawn out as if wanting to tease the wolf
>"Please, I'm about to go crazy..."
>The look on her face as she speaks these words send a spasm through your leg muscles, one last futile attempt at escape before your body surrenders to the touch of these two women
>The fox's hands are all over your chest, stomach, back and arms
>She's outside and inside your shirt all at once, leaving your skin feeling hot where her fingers caress it
>Every light scrape of her claws sends tingles through your flesh, causing your muscles to twitch and your pulse to race
>You suddenly realize you're breathing hard, your body fully supported by the fox at your back as your muscles have give in completely
>You can only watch the wolf as she shakily undoes your belt and pulls down your pants, while the fox gets your shirt of in one quick, steady motion
>You only register your nakedness as the fox hugs you tight, her soft fur brushing against your skin directly, enveloping you as if a heated blanket
>Through your haze you realize she's topless, her large breasts pressed against your back as the wolf runs her hands up and down your inner thighs
>You hear the wolf coo, her eyes locked between your legs: "Oooh, there we go; that's a good response"

>"Here, you see this?" it's the wolf's husky voice, but your eyes struggle to focus on what she's holding in front of your face
>Red, looks soft, maybe fabric? It's practically soaked, with a gleaming, wet string running to the fingers of her other hand, darkening the fur where it connects
>She dangles it in front of you like a hypnotist's pocket watch
>"I thought you said you were going crazy?" the fox muses
>"I am, but he's sooo cute... I just want to-"
>"Lay back or I'll go first." The fox's voice is mockingly stern
>"Fine," the wolf says, voice like dripping honey, before moving back and laying herself down on the mattress in front of you
>Your eyes are drawn to her body, seeing it fully exposed for the first time
>Her large breasts are heaving as she draws panting breaths, pink nipples standing erect amid black fur, ruffled and unkempt
>One hand is on her stomach, stroking the fur in a way that shows off her abs below, as if highlighting her superiority
>The other hand is on her leg, agile fingers caressing her inner thigh, drawing faint lines in her fur with her nectar
>As if guided by the motions of her fingers, you eyes lock on to her sex
>Dripping wet and oh so inviting, with pink lips spread by her arousal
>You feel like you can sense the heat from it all the way to where you are
>You can't look away, even as the fox starts pushing against your back, moving you towards the hungry wolf
>"Hurry up, would you?" you hear the wolf say, as the fox puts an arm around your waist and a hand on your erection, guiding you toward her
>"And don't worry about lasting or drawing it out - we've got aaall night to enjoy each other. Just give in to the pleasure as it comes"
>Your dick touch her wet, hot slit, sending a shiver through your body
>The fox suddenly lets go, dropping you forward onto the waiting wolf and you hilt yourself inside her
>The pleasure is immediate, washing over you as a wave of consuming warmth
>You feel yourself tense up as if you're about to explode, instinctively moving your hips to keep up with the sensation
>"Oooh, so eager!" the wolf pants between low moans and grunts of pleasure
>You can barely concentrate on what you're feeling, a demanding heat spreading from your lower body as your dick signals its upcoming release
>The wolves legs lock around your waist, her probing hands running up and down your back and arms as she lets you ride her to your heart's content
>As her pussy spasms around your shaft, gripping it tightly as she gives up a low yelp, you pass the point of no return
>Your mind goes blank as your body finds its release, your dick throbbing in rhythm with the pleasure you feel as you shoot rope after rope of your seed inside her
>"Ohmygod, yeessss..." the wolf is moaning as if in a trance, holding you tight against her body with strength far beyond your own
>You feel as if covered in her fluff, your head dizzy as you try to catch your breath
>She starts nuzzling your hair, her hands slowly caressing your back in a soothing rhythm
>You suddenly feel a hand on your butt, a slight sting from a claw drawn against your naked skin
>"Did you two forget about me?"
