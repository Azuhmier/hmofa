Chapter 1: Newborn

>Loud dinging from your phone pulls you from your sleep
>You barely register the noise as you blindly reach for it and click it open
>The light from Gabriel's Hologram makes you blink hard
>"Whassa?" you mumble sleepily
>"Null, its time"
>You snap awake instantly
>"OK, see you there"
>His hologram disappears and you stretch calmly 
>Turning to your right, you see Star still sleeping, a small smile across her face 
>She's cute and you don't want to wake her, but you both had places to be
>"Star, come on babe, wake up" you say as you gently shake her
>She buries her muzzle in her pillow, pushing your hand away
>"Nuuu five more Minutes Anon"
>"Come on love, it's time to go to the hospital"
>Quickly she uncovers her face, little exclamation marks in her eyes
>"REALLY!? Let's go then!"
>Zero to 100 with her as always
>She's already flung the blanket across the room in her haste to get out of bed
>You get out of bed and stretch before walking out of the bedroom and into your workroom
>When Gabriel and Fox lived in the bunker, this room was their bedroom
>After they moved out, Star Kicked all your stuff out of the master bedroom claiming it took up too much space
>You pull on your Standard, Jeans, a Black t-shirt, your leather bomber Jacket and your Gun belt
>The noise of Star digging through her closet makes you laugh to yourself as you put Rose into your belt holster
>"Star, you don't need to dress up! Come on!"
>You back into the bedroom and find Star half dressed, Stuck in a T-shirt
>Somehow she put her head through the sleeve and was struggling to get it off
>"Anonnnnnn! Help me!" she says pitifully as she frantically tries to pull it off
>"How did you even manage this Star?" you ask as you pull it off her roughly
>"I'm just so excited Anon!"
>You hand her the T-shirt and she pulls it on the right way
>Her usual type of shirt with a robot on it
>"Grab your Jacket, we're gonna meet them there"
>You leave the bedroom and walk through the bunker
>This was your home now, you had moved in with Star a little while ago
>It made sense after all, you loved her and wanted to spend time with her
>Even if most of the time it was watching her Anime shows
>Some of them had grown on you, that one with the giant robot with Pile bunkers for arms was awesome
>In the kitchen you use the food synthesizer to make 2 large sandwiches, which you put into bags and pocket
>You feel like this might take a while
>"Come on Star!" you call to her
>"Coming!"
>She rushes out of the bedroom, fully dressed with a big smile on her Muzzle
>"I'm so Excited Anon!"
>You smile and usher her to your Bike and climb into it
>She scrambles up the side and into your lap with the grace of a deer trying to stand on ice
>"You got the package for Gabriel Anon?"
>You nod as you start the bike then pull down the Canopy
>"Yea I got it"
>You drive up the ramp and onto the streets, checking in your mirrors to see the bunker door close behind you
>"Let's go Anon! Punch it!"
>You smile and follow Star's orders, Speeding down the streets onto the Megaway
>Star bounces in your lap happily as she watches Speeder and haulers get passed
>Neon lights and city light blur as you Speed through traffic
>You take a glance at the Dashboard clock
>3 pm
>How people were awake at this time was beyond you
>But then again you were opposite most people
>"Anon Look at the Sky! It's so Pretty!" Star says pointing upwards
>The Sky has turned an eerie blue
>An Electromagnetic storm? now? somehow fitting for the occasion
>Star's eyes are locked on the sky as you floor it towards the hospital
>You don't want her implants getting fried, so it was best to get there before the storm fully hits
>Pulling off the Megaway and into the side streets, you make your way to the hospital as thunder crackles ominously
>"Come on come on!" Star says bouncing in your lap as you park
>You push the canopy up and lift her out of the bike then get out yourself
>From behind your seat you pull a long package out
>"Ok Star, ready"
>She walks to the service elevators implant scanner and lets it scan her
>It dings and takes your Bike into the unseen depths below the city street, stashing your bike
>Ever since you had started getting star out of the bunker more often she used her implants to help you out
>Elevators, parking, things like that
>Granted when you were out by yourself things were more difficult 
>You extend a hand to Star and heft the long package under your arm
>She smiles as she takes it and you walk hand in paw to the hospital doors, which open automatically
>The help desk is there, an anthro Puma waiting behind it with wires running through her hair and connected into various plugs on her computers
>"Hi, where the Maternity ward? and where is Jaimee Comstock's room?" you ask calmly
>Star bounces excitedly next to you, eager to see Fox
>The Puma points to an elevator, "56th floor, ward A, room 360"
>You thank her and are practically pulled by Star to the elevator
>"Hurry hurry! I don't wanna miss it!" she says as she scans her implant and pressing the 56th floor button
>"Calm down Star, we aren't going to miss anything, if anything we'll be waiting for a bit" you say to the Hyperactive opossum
>She looks up at you with shooting stars in her eyes
>"I would rather be early than late!"
>Well she had you there
>The elevator dings and opens
>Star immediately pulls you out and rushes to a sign on the wall
>It tells you which way to go to reach Fox's room
>"Let's go!" she says pulling you harder down the hall
>After a bit of walking you find Fox's room
>Gabriel is sitting next to a very very pregnant Fox, who gives a smile when you and Star enter
>"Null, Star! You made it!" she says with some discomfort in her voice
>You walk forward and give her a one armed hug 
>"We wouldn't miss it for the world Fox"
>Star shuffles nervously
>"Are you OK Fox? You seem uncomfortable" She says with a bit of uncertainty
>Fox smiles
>"I'm ok, not gonna go into details but my cervix isn't Dilating enough"
>You grimace, Hybrid pregnancies always were complicated
>"How long are they gonna wait?" you ask setting the package down on a table
>"They're gonna check back in an hour, if it hasn't sped up they're gonna take her into surgery" Gabriel says stone faced
>Your frown deepens
>"Alright, we'll be here"
>Gabriel nods towards the box you set down
>"What's in the box Null?"
>"It's a surprise for later!" Star says as she walks over to him and gives him a hug
>He smiles at her
>"Oh? a surprise from Ms.Dismond? I can hardly wait" he says with a smirk
>"NO! Not Ms.Dismond! Just Star! I hate when you call me that!"
>Star begins stomping around angrily as she speaks, causing Fox to laugh
>"He's just teasing you Star"
>You lean against a wall and watch 
>Today is gonna be a day to remember

2 hours later
>You're sitting in a waiting room with Star in your lap
>Shes playing some weird game on her phone while you stare out the window
>They were performing a C-section on Fox
>As far as medicine has come along, there is still uncertainty
>Mothers still die during birth, cubs sometimes don't make it
>All harsh realities you hoped wouldn't rear their heads today
>They wouldn't let you and Star into the room, said it was for family only
>You and Gabriel tried to argue it, but they put their foot down
>So you watched as lightning arced across the sky, striking taller buildings
>The waiting always kills you, but you can't focus on anything right now
>Too much worry
>Otherwise you would focus on playing a game with Star
>Your hand rubs Star's early gently and her tail is wrapped around your waist
>She hums cheerfully as her game dings and beeps
>Oh, to be so carefree
>You often envy just how cheerful Star was
>She hadn't seen the darker side of life like you had
>So when things were bad, she either didn't realize it or just had some deep reserve of optimism you either never had or it ran dry a long time ago
>The only time you had ever seen her worry was when Fox was in a coma from being shot
>Every other time she was fine, even when you were in gun fights, she spoke through your helmet like you weren't in a fight for your life
>You suppose you both balanced each other out
>A nurse snaps you from your thoughts
>"They're ready for you Mr. Anon! The Surgery was a total success!"
>Waves of relief wash over you as Star slides out of your lap 
>Almost subconsciously you feel yourself moving with a strange happy numbness
>A cub, your best friend's cub
>After all the pain and heartache, she was here
>You walk in the room to Fox holding a bundle of fur and Gabriel beaming at her
>She looks just like Fox, but with Gabriel's steel grey eyes which look up at you as you approach
>"Look Hope, it's your Uncle" Fox cooes to her
>You look to Gabriel, and can see a bit of lament on his face
>He couldn't hold her with his big mechanical arm
>You smile at him and grab the box from the table
>"Star, I think it's time for that surprise"
>She bounces happily and rushes over to Gabriel, then pulls his mechanical arm off
>"Hey Star what the fu-!"
>You open the box in front of him, cutting his words short
>Inside is a Sleeker Cybernetic arm, covered in false skin and looking like an exact copy of his real arm
>"Surprise daddy-o!" says Star, who has a bit of trouble holding up his heavy mechanical arm
>You pick up the new arm and carry it to him and push it into place
>"Star and I figured you might want to hold your daughter"
>He stares at the arm, wiggling the fingers
>"Null, I don't know wh-"
>You raise a hand to stop him
>"Hold your daughter"
>You see the tears in his eyes as Fox carefully passes Hope to him
>Star beams at him as you take his weighty arm from her and set it down
>You had only seen Gabriel cry once before, and you preferred this time
>"When does she get to go home with you?" 
>Fox adjusts herself a bit in her bed before she answers
>"The doctors want to keep us both here for a few days for observation, then we can go"
>You watch Gabriel gently rock hope back and forth, humming softly to her
>The amount of blood spilled to bring her into this world was staggering
>But if anyone wanted to try to take her out of it, there would be so much more
>You place a hand on Gabriel's shoulder and look down at the now sleeping cub
>The world wasn't perfect, but this moment with Star, Gabriel, Fox and Hope
>This moment was


Chapter 2: On the Other Side
>The sun is setting as you leave the hospital with Star
>At least you think its setting, its hard to tell through the rain and Fog
>Plus you're almost never up at this time
>There was no point to being up at this time
>The people you hunt were in their shitholes
>Star waves her arm in front of the Service elevator to bring up your bike
>A raindrop must've gone down her back because she jumps slightly and shivers a bit
>She stamps around angrily 
>"THIS IS WHY I LIKE MY BUNKER! RAIN SUCKS!" She Yells at the sky
>You smile at her cute antics
>But you also don't enjoy standing in the Rain
>So as soon as your bike is up you open the canopy and climb in
>Her hear Star's paws slipping against the slick metal of the bike as she attempts to get it
>"Anonnnnn! Help me! I'm too short!"
>You smile as you reach out and help pull her into the bike and onto your lap
>"Thanks Anon, I'm tired; we didn't get much sleep last night"
>She was right, neither of you got much sleep
>You had gone out earlier for her to get one of her various toys and she stayed up late putting it together
>As well you were tracking several bounties for Lysander after you returned
>A corrupt politician who wasn't paying her for support, a child molester and a rogue weapons dealer
>Not that you cared who they were
>Besides the child molester, you cared about that
>Fuck pedophiles, you were going to make that one hurt
>You pull the bikes canopy closed and punch the ignition
>The city blurs by as you speed forwards
>As you drive your mind drifts back to Hope, Fox and Gabriel
>They deserved this, all of you did
>In a world that was literally bleak and dreary, there was a beacon
>A small light in your world of blood and rain
>Well besides the bouncing opossum in your lap
>You rub Star's ears gently with one hand as you drive
>"Mmmmm I LOVE when you rub my ears Anon" Star says almost in a dream like state
>One of the few things that could stop Star in her tantrums or hyperactive excitement were your "Magic fingers"
>You can't help but smile as she leans back against your chest, looking up at you with starry eyes
>"I know you do Star, that's why I do it" you say as you rub absentmindedly, while weaving through the speeders and haulers
>Traffic is always the same in the City
>The city never sleeps, someone always had things to do
>You actually got more sleep in the bunker With Star than you did in your old apartment
>You pull into the ruins where Star's Bunker is located
>"The Rundown"
>That's what this area was called
>There were more places like this in the city too
>Buildings built on buildings built on buildings built on buildings
>Too tall to support their weight and collapsing from it
>All waterlogged and crumbling
>But to you it was home
>The hidden bunker door opens and you drive down the ramp leading into the bunker
>Home sweet home
>You push open the canopy of your bike and Star scrambles out, slipping from the wetness and falling flat onto the ground
>If it were anyone else you would be concerned, but she's done this enough times for you to know she's fine
>If anything she would be annoyed at your concern, it would slow her down
>She always did operate at 100MPH
>As you climb out of the bike yourself, she's cemented herself to your side
>A long time ago you learned she would always latch onto you when you got home
>Either from her scavenger hunts for toys, or from your real hunts to make more people dead
>So you learned to know how to keep your Balance when she was holding you
>But you really did love your tiny Opossum
>You walk with her holding your side, her legs wrapped around your left leg and her arms around your waist
>Another trick you learned from time with her
>"Anon! Do you think you're ready for a hunt for another Gunpla? there's a 30th anniversary PG 1/60 MS-06F ZAKU II GUNDAM"
>You yawn loudly and drag Star to the bedroom
>"I doubt it Star, this isn't when we're usually up and last thing I need is to wreck my bike because I fell asleep behind the wheel"
>There were some people who had augments that injected caffeine and other stimulants directly into their bloodstream
>But all you had was sheer will and coffee
>And both were wearing thin
>The waiting room of the hospital and lack of sleep were weighing your eyelids down
>Star lets go of you as you begin taking off your jacket and clothes with a loud yawn
>"Sorry Star, maybe after we get some sleep"
>She's silent for a moment, which is odd for her
>You pull your shirt over your head and see her looking at a hologram of Fox and Hope together
>"Star? You ok?"
>Your voice snaps her back to you
>She quickly closes the hologram and sets it aside and changed into her pajamas
>And by pajamas you mean Just her panties
>You never did get tired of seeing those grapefruit sized Breasts of hers but right now you're too tired
>So for the time being your content with getting into bed with her, silently savoring the feeling of her fur and those glorious mounds of flesh
>Her back to your chest, your arms around her, your chin on the top of her head, a few stray blue hairs tickling your nose
>"Hey Anon, I have a favor to ask you"
>Her words make you jump, you were right about to fall asleep
>"Whassa Star?" you mumble out
>"Can you...Can you help me find my mom?"
>Those words snap you back awake
>Star never spoke about her mom
>For someone who was so open with everything it was odd, but you didn't press the issue
>After all you knew all about problems with parents
>You chose your words carefully as you respond
>"I can try Star, I can talk to your father about it but I can't guarantee anything"
>She snuggles further into your chest, pulling your arms around her in a tight hug
>"As long as you try Anon" She mumbles, half asleep
>Her cuteness is adorable
>You nod to yourself about what you had to do
>Sure it was another person you had to track, but for Star it was worth it
>The world fades to black as you fall asleep with your favorite pint sized opossum in your arms

>The smell of Bacon and coffee wake you gently
>Smells like the start to a good morning for sure
>You sit up and stretch slowly, savoring the feeling of actually getting a full night of sleep
>It sounds like Star woke up and has already started watching one of her Anime shows
>Probably Gundam wing for the 500th times
>You throw on a shirt and head into the main room 
>Star is happily humming while cooking bacon and watching her show
>It IS gundam wing, how she's able to rewatch it so many times is beyond you
>"Morning Anon! I had the food synth make Bacon!"
>You pull her into a kiss and pick her up in a hug
>"I can see that Star, thank you" you say as you break from the kiss
>Her eyes turn into little hearts as she looks at you
>It has to be illegal to be that cute
>You smile at her and set her down
>"Were you serious about wanting me to find your Mother Star?" you ask as you watch her tend to the Bacon
>"Mhm! I never knew her, and Seeing Fox with Hope made me want to find her!"
>Great, that means you're going to have to talk to her father 
>Jon Dismond, Leader of the Dismond Crime Syndicate
>He didn't dislike you per se, more tolerated you because of your involvement with his only child
>Plus the fact that you worked for the Concordat, one of his allies
>But still talking to him was something you actively avoided
>"Alright Star, I'll try"
>In the main room of the bunker was Star's elaborate computer setup
>A wall covered in Monitors 
>And next to it was your computer
>A small beat up machine you used for finding bounties and talking to other hunters
>You sit down at it and click on the program used to calling others
>A few clicks and your call to Dismond is ringing
>Within Moments he picks up, his usual neutral face stares at you
>"Anon? What do I owe the pleasure of a call? Need to kill more of my rivals?"
>You grunt out a laugh
>"Not today, I do need info though"
>He nods "Who are you gonna kill today?"
>"No one actually, Star asked me to find her mother"
>His face flickers for a moment, from the usual neutral look to a look of surprise ten back to neutral in a second
>"Her name is Juno Cassiopeia, you won't find her though, no one has seen her in years"
>You frown 
>"Why is that?" you ask, almost dreading the answer
>"After Star was born she disappeared Beneath the city, most people are smart enough to not go down there"
>Fuck
>The underbelly of the city was dangerous
>Speeders and haulers were stored there, parts and machines always moved, weather control stations constantly fired of arcs of electricity
>To say she was down there is a terrifying prospect
>You rub the bridge of your nose 
>"Fuck, that makes things difficult" you say
>"It does, good luck Anon. I must be going" he says and closes the call
>You look over and see Star standing with a plate of bacon and Eggs, mouth agape
>"She's beneath the city? How will you find her Anon" She says meekly
>You had ways
>Ways you didn't want to talk about with Star
>Ways that involved you getting bloody for Lysander
>"I'll figure it out Star, but for now let's just watch some of your shows and eat" 
>She gives you a doofy Grin
>"OK Anon! Come on!"
>She grabs your hand in her paw and practically drags you to the chair in front of all her monitors
>You sit down and she scrambles into your lap 
>"I Love you Anon" she says, looking up at you with half a piece of bacon in her mouth
>You smile at her
>I love you too Star"
>As you eat with her you think about the underbelly
>That's where the New crime syndicate "the Holy emperors" were pouring out of
>Thoughts for another time though
>You focus on eating with star and enjoying her company
>She wiggles happily as she watches her show for the hundredth time
>Life with her made you happy
>You were going to find her mom for her
>Just to make her happy
>That was a promise

Chapter 3: Thriller
>How do you track someone who disappeared into the most dangerous place on the planet?
>Not even on the planet 
>IN the planet
>The systems that run and power the city run deep, all the way into the core
>How else can a city that covers every mile of the world stay powered?
>Everywhere needed something
>The mountains, like Everest, covered top to bottom in houses and businesses
>The higher they were, the more expensive,
>The deserts needed water pumped from the ever shrinking oceans
>And because of that conduits and subsystems ran throughout
>You were going to have to dive deep into it all
>Star's Mother was somewhere down there 
>But where to start?
>Dismond had given you only the most basic of facts, her name and where she was last seen
>Tracking someone on the surface was easy, they would get scanned by something eventually
>Star fell asleep a while ago, Her shows playing in the background
>You carried your tiny Opossum and tucked her into bed before going to your bike and getting in
>Lysander would know what to do
>You hated having to owe her a favor
>No doubt kill someone high up, someone who now was prepared for you
>Ever since you got Andrew Belacov, things have been different
>Crime lords getting people to watch video feeds
>You never thought you would be such a threat, after all, you're just a single man
>But they thought you were
>A single man everywhere at once?
>Hardly
>Just a force pointed in a single direction
>In all honesty you didn't care who it was
>Why should you
>The people in the government didn't care about anyone
>And when Lysander sent you after them they suddenly cared
>Cared about the sex worker trying to feed her kids, about the bounty hunter ready to give it all for a big score
>As your bike roared through the city you smirked to yourself
>Neon light flowed like rain on a windshield
>Most of the population of the city hasn't seen the ugly part of life
>When Gabriel killed Belacov it turned everything upside down
>The Emperor's flowed out
>They were brutal, uncaring and used whatever means possible
>There were reports of them pulling Augments out of their victims
>As such they were often mismatched
>Arms too long,  jury-rigged eyes 
>What they lacked in power they made up in sheer number
>Thousands of runaways, poor people tempted by the promise of a better life
>Before you met Star you had heard of the Emperors, they at one point tried to recruit you telling you that life could be better
>But you had functioned as a killer for so long before because life ment little to you
>You lived; great, you survived another day
>You died, it finally ended; the torment of life in a world that didn't care about a unaugmented person
>The world blurs by as you pull into the concordat headquarters, a mansion on a giant grassy hill
>Another sign on wealth, most plants grew in between cracks in the pavement
>The near constant rain made everything a tangle of vines and shrubs
>At least here in this part of the city it did
>How did other parts of the city survive?
>You were in a moderately temperate part, dealing with no extremes
>Maybe later you could travel, convince Star to see different parts of the world with you
>Could you convince her to travel to the Ringworld of Alpha Centauri?
>Probably not, but it was worth a try
>But those thoughts are for another day
>You smirk as the Mansions staff try to take control of your bike
>It never works, and each time they try something new
>Always focused on a augment, a system in the motor that they can hook their systems into
>You have no doubt that Lysander kept them from knowing how to stop you
>A Little Game between her and her staff
>And each time they failed to figure out how to stop you someone got punished
>Not your problem at this point
>You had told them early on they cant control you bike via normal methods
>Or at all
>The fact they didn't listen was not your problem
>As you park you smirk to yourself as you climb out of the bike
>A new butler, a new assistant bent on trying to prove they could stop you
>The first one you met, a giraffe anthro who knew better; had decided to only serve from inside the mansion
>Every other one that was in charge of tracking you failed
>They never saw what Lysander did to them
>And you never warned them
>Not your problem and not your job
>Why would you try to protect them from a job they signed up for?
>You park your bike and stroll past the most recent attempt to stop you
>"Where is she?" you as as you walk past the stupefied wolf
>He chokes out something about a music room as you push past him
>He was a dead man walking, 
>But he didn't know it yet
>You walk through the mansion, past all the delicately carved pillars
>Through the art galleries hanging, to the music room
>You push the door open to a lavish room, full of various instruments
>The walls are all covered in soundproofing materials and there are bookshelves filled with Music sheets 
>In the center there is Lysander with a viola that would be a cello to a normal sized person
>It always threw you off seeing someone so big move so gracefully
>You stand and watch her play under the guidance of a small wizened mouse anthro
>Occasionally She would play a note wrong and the mouse would make a certain motion with his fingers
>"Move your fingers like this" he says as he shows her
>After about 10 or some minutes she sets down the Viola 
>"Thank you Mr.Castellos, I will see you next  week" She says to the mouse
>The mouse bows deeply
>"Of course Madam, I look forward to it" he replys before leaving
>Lysander's eyes fall to you and light up slightly
>"Anon, what a pleasant surprise; to what do I owe this visit?" 
>She gracefully strolls over to you
>"I need a safe way to get into the underground, I'm looking for someone there"
>She puts a paw to her chin and looks at you thoughtfully
>"I see. Come, we will discuss this as we walk"
>She leads you out of the room
>"Do you know why the underground is so hard to get into for people?"  She says as she strides along
>You frown, you had some ideas but not the full picture
>"It's dangerous, lots of moving things can crush people down there"
>She shakes her head, causing her Flowing black hair to twirl slightly
>"Only partially right, I see I need to teach you"
> Why does that scare you?
>She leads you into her library, which is huge and has bookshelves full of actual books
>This must all be worth a fortune
>"Sit, I will show you" she directs you to a large couch with a table in front of it
>You follow her directions and watch as she pulls a large book off a shelf
>She strides over and opens the book, then places it on the table
>"We anthros were created to be servants to humanity, we were stronger, faster, and in some cases smaller"
>She shows you a page covered in photos of Anthros slaving away underneath a boiling sun
>"The Underground was built almost exclusively by Small Anthros, Mice, shrews, and moles; because of that most tunnels underground are too small for humans and anthros like me" she says turning a few pages to pictures of Mice anthros working below the ground
>"When humans made robots and gave us our freedom, Small robots took over maintaining the underground, and they are nearly autonomous. Because of that there very few tunnels or safe ways down there"
>You frown
>"So there is no real way down there for me?" you ask
>She shakes her head
>"I did not say that dear Anon, there is a way down there but I need something from you first"
>You saw that coming
>"What do you need?"
>"There is a politician, Senator Jensen, a pedophile politician who has his fingers in Human and anthro trafficking, you need to kill him and make him suffer"
>Another pedophile? Great.
>"Why doesn't he get arrested?"
>Lysander sighs
>"The usual political wall, they can't get caught if they have enough friends and money"
>You nod "where can I find him?"
>She smiles, showing off her large sabre like teeth
>"He's in the Arcology, where we don't know exactly but we know his Implant ID code for you to track him"
>She claps and one of her butlers brings her a data chip, which she hands to you
>"You take care of this Anon, and I will help you get into the underground"
>You nod and stand up
>"Thank you Madam, I'll take care of this for you"
>She purrs loudly and looks you over
>"I'm sure you will Anon, you have yet to let me down"
>You turn and leave, heading out to your bike
>He was in the Arcology. Great, that made things more difficult
>The Arcology was one of the government's attempts to make more space for human expansion
>It was essentially a giant floating city in the ocean
>In truth it wasn't floating at all, giant pillars ran from the ocean floor to the big structure
>Getting to it was difficult, there was a single lane Megaway tunnel heading in, which was completely underwater
>Most of the people who live there were high rollers
>Like a corrupt politician
>You knew you could fly below the radar but they might have stepped up their security like many areas had
>As you get into your bike you think about it
>Perhaps you could get a False ID beacon for your bike
>There are a few people you could turn to to get one
>You can think of one that owes you a favor anyway
>Neon light blurs past as you head to his "workshop"
>It's just one of the storage containers onboard one of the cargo tanker cities
>You punch in his number on your phone and wait for him to pick up
>An anthro weasel picks up and smiles nervously, , one of his ears replaced with an odd looking receiver dish
>"Heeeey Null, my favorite human! What do you need?"
>You frown as you speed past a hauler
>"Marco, I need a transceiver beacon that mimics a transport truck and can cloak a bike"
>He scratches his chin
>"Ohhh? And what will you give me for it?"
>Your frown deepens
>"Cut the shit Marco, I bailed you out when you had the syndicate after you, you owe me"
>He frowns "That isn't enough to cover what you're asking for Null"
>"Fine, I'll tell Dismond where you are and get someone else to do this for me"
>If Marco didn't have fur you would have seen the blood drain from his face
>"Y-you wouldn't! Dismond would be after you too"
>No one knows that you're in a relationship with Dismond's Daughter
>Hell most people don't even know Star exists
>"They wouldn't kill me though, especially if I turn you into them"
>You pull up Marco's bounty
>1k credits for him captured and Alive
>"I can think of a lot of things I can buy with a thousand credits Marco, Like a beacon"
>His eyes bulge a bit in fear 
>"Uh... Uh , Yeah you're right Null, silly me! I'll get on that for you! it'll be ready in a few days!"
>You frown at that info and change course yet again
>If he can't have it today might as well go back home to Star
>"Alright, call me when it's ready. Don't think I'll forget either, if I don't hear from you in 3 days I'm coming for you"
>You tap Rose in her holster as you give your warning
>He isn't your friend so you don't mind turning him in, but he was useful, that's the only reason you left him 
>He nods frantically  "Yea Null, I'll get right on it, dont worry about it! I'll-"
>You hang up
>No need to listen to his rambling
>Your bike roars through the megaway as you swerve around speeders and haulers
>Maybe you should get a bit more intel 
>Lysander might have contacts around the underworld but you do too
>Plus a few in the overworld
>You dial up a number you rarely use
>Sergeant Winters
>The Anthro German shepherd called you occasionally for info or for you to deal with certain suspects
>The law can only go so far, sometimes suspects go free because of small technicalities
>Or they had the right connections
>You took care of them, which racked up several favors from him
>After a ring or two he hologram appears
>"This is Sergeant Win- Oh its you, one sec"
>His hologram disappears and you assume yours does on his end
>"What do you need" he says in a hushed tone
>You know he can't look up the senator without leaving a trail so you'll have to ask the next best thing
>"I need a list of security measures the Arcology has and a list of residents" you say calmly
>"By when?"
>"3 days"
>A speeder honks at you as you cut it off and zip down a Ramp to a side street
>"Got it, I'll send you a dead drop location"
>He hangs up without another word
>What he was doing wasn't illegal, however it wasn't legal either
>There is no law against a police officer looking into a certain area about a cold case and possibly losing the paper trail
>Still it was better to be discrete and not have to deal with it
>Water streaks past on your canopy as you head to the bunker
>Hopefully Star was still asleep
>She didn't need to see and hear what you do most of the time
>While she did monitor your feed while you took care of the trash of the city, it was different 
>She watched violence on TV all the time in her weird anime shows, watching you work was similar
>Seeing in on a screen and seeing it in real life was different 
>As well your methods for information gathering was often brutal and threatening
>Favors for favors for bounty hunters are like that.
>You push all that from your mind as you drive through the rundown, crumbling houses to the bunker
>The thought of food digs itself into your mind as you drive down the ramp and get out of your bike
>Maybe make some of that Udon with the whole egg and fish cakes?
>Yea that sounds good
>You head into the kitchen and type away at the food synthesizer and hit the "GO" button
>The sound of paws hitting tile behind you makes you turn around
>Star is walking towards you sleepily, her eyes with little 'z's scrolling through them; wearing panties and a shirt that was a bit too tight
>"Hey babe, did you have a good nap?" you ask as she walks forwards sleepily and locks her arms around your waist
>"Mhmm what did you do while I napped?" she says lazily
>"Work stuff to find your mother"
>She eyes change into little Exclamation marks
>"REALLY!? What did you find?!
>0 to 100 with her always
>You rub her ears gently
>"Nothing so far, I have to wait on a few of my contacts but I'll find her"
>The Synthesizer dings causing Star to jump into your arms
>You can't help but laugh a bit
>She hits your chest with a tiny fist
>"NOT FUNNY! That scared me!"
>"Sorry sorry, I made udon Star, you want some?"
>Her eyes switch from little flames of anger to little spinning stars
>"Oooo yes! Gimme gimme!"
>She squirms out of your arms and dashes to the food synthesizer where she grabs your food 
>"Mine now!"
>You sigh and put in the code to make more
>No way were you going to try to get food from her, especially japanese food
>That's a good way to get bitten
>You hear Star noisily slurping up the noodles by the time your bowl is ready for you
>"Oi get up" you say as you walk to the chair in front of the monitors
>Star is sitting there eating happily but she usually sits in your lap 
>Not like you can sit in hers
>She sets her bowl of noodles down on a table next to the chair then gets up quickly to let you sit and raise your arms so she can scramble into your lap 
>"Whatcha wanna watch 'Non?"
>You weren't about to let her pick, she would inevitably pick one of her gundam shows
>"Uh what's that one with the guy that punches everything?"
>Her eyes morph into little question marks
>"That doesn't narrow Anything down! Describe it more!"
>"Uh he's bald and wears yellow?" you say between mouthfuls of noodles
>"You mean One Punch man? Thats a good one!"
>You guess that's it, not like you could tell until it was on
>She scrolled through various shows until she seems to find the right one
>Honestly you were too busy eating to pay attention to whatever she put on
>Most of her shows were confusing, but you liked the one about the space bounty hunters
>She always compared you to Spike Spiegel and Gabriel to Jet Black
>You could see the resemblance but Gabriel isn't THAT much older than you
>As the show starts you feel Star's long tail wrap around your waist
>You eat in silence while Star rocks side to side on your lap happily
>God damn she's cute
>Maybe you could have a little fun with her?
>Gently at first you place your hands on her hips and press her down onto you
>Her ears perk a bit but she continues rocking side to side, then back and forth
>Maybe a bit more
>You push your fingers into her panties waistline and rub while pushing her down onto your every growing erection
>"Mmmmm don't start what you can't finish" She whispers
>"Ohh I can finish it, can you handle it though?"
>She grinds a bit on you
>"Betcha you can't" she says as she gasps slightly 
>You totally can and will

Chapter 4: Heart of Gold

>Star's grinding is nothing short of blissful torture as you kisses her neck and held her paws
>You knew that her pupils would be little beating hearts if you could see them
>Her long tail was wrapped around your waist and she gasped as you nuzzles her ears 
>"Mmmm Anon don't tease me too much" she whispers as your hands separate from her paws
>They run down her sides until you're able to grip the hem of her shirt
>Now this is just gonna get in the way
>You lift it off her swiftly and toss it aside 
>Much better
>Star's habit of not wearing a bra is certainly helpful when if come to getting to massage those amazing grapefruit sized orbs that were her breasts
>Your fingers run through her smooth fur, savoring the silky smoothness
>You feel her tiny paws gripping at your pants as she try to pull them off you while still sitting in your lap
>"These are in my way" She coos softly as she grinds on you
>Her eyes are little fiery hearts and she has a smile painted across her muzzle
>You gently slide her off you and stand
>Belt, gone
>Pants? Thrown across the room
>Shirt? Who needs it?
>You keep your eyes locked on hers as you strip, showing off your abs and muscled body
>You might not have augments but you do have a good body
>"Ooo so sexy" Star moans at you 
>"Your turn love" 
>You motion to her panties as you speak
>What Star lacks in grace she makes up for in sheer enthusiasm
>She nearly falls on her face as she slides her panties off 
>"Chair! NOW!" 
>As you wish
>As you sit back down on the chair, she’s immediately pressed her chest against yours as she straddles you
>You wrap your arms around her and pull her into a kiss and feel her tongue fight yours in a sensual dual
>Her long tail coils itself around your right leg as she moans into your mouth
>"Annnnonnnnn you’re sexxxyyy" she moans quietly
>Might as well prove it. 
>You can feel her wetness pressed against your thigh as your hands fall on her glorious round ass
>Squeeze it, spread it gently as you tease her
>She grinds forwards and back against your thigh as she moans
>"Nooo fair I want to tease you too"
>Her tiny paws snake down your chest until the wrap tightly around your stiff member
>You feel her press it against her wet lips and she grinds
>She lifts herself up and slowly lowers down onto you, getting quiet gasping moans
>This isn’t want you would call teasing but fuck it
>Tiny hearts fill her eyes as she rides you, her nipples rubbing against your lower chest
>Your hands still squeeze and grip her ass, helping her move up and down your shaft
>As she slowly pumps against you her paws grip your shoulders, claws digging into your skin 
>She gasps as you grip her hips, helping move her
>Her insides, alright tight from her size, clamp down tight as you feel her legs shudder
>"O-o-oh! Anonnnnnn its gooooood" She moans as she slumps against you
>You continue thrusting into her as she moans and nuzzles into your chest
>Her insides stay tight and spasm gently as you thrust like a piston into her
>"S-Star I’m gonn-" 
>You're interrupted by a loud explosion from the Show you and star were watching
>The sound is enough to throw off your rhythm and stop you 
>It also causes Star to jump slightly
>For the first time you see the little flames of angry erupt in Star's eyes regarding one of her shows
>She angrily spins around with you still inside her clenching wetness
>"RUDE! Let put on something More to fit the mood!"
>As she clicks away at random something you watch her tail wrap itself around your arm
>What was she up to?
>Before long she has a video of a human and a wolfess pulled up
>The Wolfess has her back to the human, her tail raised and the human fucking her in her ass
>"Ooo Anon. I've watched this video SOOOO much! I want to try it" Star says and she sits back against you
>What
>When was she watching this?
>You look down at her and see her eyes shaped like little hearts focused on you
>"Can we try it at least once Anon?"
>How do you respond to a pint sized Opossum that wants you to fuck her ass?
>With a whole hearted FUCK YES
>Well as long as you don’t hurt her
>"Uh Ok Star, as long as I don't hurt you I’m fine with that"
>She looks up at you with her usual doofy grin
>"OKAY! I GOT STUFF JUST FOR THIS!"
>Why is she so excited about this? 
>But then again you would be lying if you said you weren’t excited too
>She slides off your lap, slipping you out of her wetness
>You don’t even have a moment to think about the missed warmness before she’s off to the bedroom
>What is she even getting? 
>You're left to sit and ponder while her video plays 
>Before long you her the skittering of her paws
>"OK! IM ALL BUTTERED UP AND READY!"
>The way she said that sounds totally unsexy
>Star runs back into the room excitedly, her tail flicking behind her
>Thankfully she doesn’t jump on you this time
>Instead she kneels in front of you with a smile
>"I've always wanted to try this with you" Star murmurs as she uses her paws to rub up and down your member
>She gives you a few long licks up and down the shaft before climbing up into your lap once again
>"Uhmm how should I do this?" She whispers to herself 
>She seems torn on whether to face you or face the screen
>Time to take charge
>You grip her plump hips, lift her and set her in your lap
>Her tail wraps around your waist as you slide your hands up her sides to grip her large breasts
>"Ok ok just gotta go Slowwwwly"
>She lifts herself gently and reaches down, getting a good grip of your member and positioning the head 
>"Sloooowwww"
>With a surprising amount of care, she slowly lowers herself down
>As you slide deeper into her she gasps
>Her ass is tight, tighter than you expected  
>You don't know what kind of lube she used but it’s amazing
>After a few moments filled with gasps and moans she’s lowered herself all the way down onto you
>Her tail is wrapped tight around your waist and tightens each time she gasps
>"Oooooh so big Anon, I always forget how big you are" she moans up at you
>Her eyes shaped eyes beat quickly
>"Ready to start moving?" you ask, moving your hands to her supple hips 
>She nods frantically
>"Mmmm yes Anon!"
>You help guide her up and down, earning you louder moans
>She leans forwards, putting her paws on your knees and moves faster 
>You grip her sides as you feel her insides clench and squeeze you
>Her wetness drips on your thighs
>You begin thrusting into her harder, using your hand to bring her down hard
>She pumps up and down like a piston on you, moaning loudly
>You groan as you feel yourself reaching your limit
>"S-star I’m gonna-!"
>DO IT FILL ME! FILL ME UP ANON!"
>With one final thrust, you bring her down on you and explode into her and paint her insides white
>You pant slightly as she sits and grinds on you happily
>"Mmmm that was fun anon, let’s do that again sometime"
>You wrap your arms around her and pulls her back so she’s leaning against you
>"Yea, let's do that some more"
>She looks up at you and smiles, hearts fill her eyes
>"Love you Anon" she says with a happy smile
>"Love you too Star"
>Such a great way to kick off an evening


Chapter 5: Make Me Fade

>The waiting game was always hard for you
>You wanted to just go and get things done and over
>Sure you got to relax with Star and Play her video games with her
>There was also a ton of watching her shows with her
>You still had no clue what they were about but at least the action sequences were cool
>How do these robot-things kill other robots by skydiving with a surfboard?
>It makes no sense at all
>Just get a gun and shoot the fucking things
>But the Japanese always were a bit weird after the nukes fell 2 millennia ago
>Of course they still had really good food too
>Star was in the kitchen currently, baking something as a surprise to you
>She said she learned it from Fox, who taught her how to cook while her and Gabriel lived in the bunker with her
>You sat in the chair in front of her computer, reading about the Holy emperors
>They really were just pouring out from the underground
>How did they get in and out of it so easily? No one knew where they came out of since the official maintenance tunnels were still sealed shut
>You had checked every single one.
>It was the third day, so Sgt Winters and Marco should be getting to you
>As you scroll through the record of the old maintenance tunnels you hear Star humming happily
>You recognize the tune from one of her shows but can't pinpoint which
>The smell of cinnamon and vanilla waft through the bunker 
>The fact she learned how to cook was great and while her cooking wasn't quite on par with Foxes, it was quite good
>"10 more minutes Anon! you're gonna like it!" you hear Star call happily from the kitchen
>As interested as you were in whatever she was making, you had to make sure you weren't going to die
>You pull up the blueprints for the Arcology
>Having access to this kinda stuff was tough, but Dismond had given you access to their resources
>Lysander had as well, and having the resources of two of the biggest Crime syndicates was a huge boon
>But even they didn't have access to everything
>Military schematics, Security details for buildings, and info on high up people
>Unfortunately those were the three things you needed
>As you sit and look over the route in and out of the Arcology
>Ugh one way in and out, makes things much more difficult
>But not impossible
>The sound of your phone going off snaps you out of your thinking
>You answer quickly, right after the first ring
>No hologram to be seen tells you its Winters coming through for you
>"Jobs done, it's in the usual spot" His voice says quickly before hanging up
>As much as you would like to thank him for the favor, you knew he had a job to do
>The usual spot was near the lucky Cat Brothel in the red light
>Behind it actually, The Concordat and Missy would make sure no one else picked it up
>You stand up out and start getting ready
>shock knife, gun belt, Bandolier, scanner, Rose and your helmet
>"Wait Anon! I'm almost done!"
>You feel a furry cannonball hit your side with a force that makes you stumble
>Star has latched onto your side with her legs, arms and tail wrapped around you
>You smile and rub her ears gently
>"Of course Star, Lets see what you made for me"
>Not like you were going to just leave without finding out what she made
>Especially when she was so excited to make you something
>Her eyes morph into little shooting stars as she tries to climb you like a weird tree
>As cute as it was, her claws could tear your clothes up
>So instead of letting this go on, you pick her up and lift her so she's face to face with you
>She latches onto you again, her long tail wrapped around your arm and her legs locked around your chest
>"I Love you Anon! Can I watch you work?"
>you smile
>"Of course Star, where would I be without my comms officer"
>Her eyes turn to little beating hearts
>She loves when you call her your comms officer
>There is a ding from the kitchen so you walk over to it, Star still wrapped around you
>"Open the oven! Looky looky looky!" Star says excitedly bouncing up and down excitedly against you
>You pull the oven open and see a pie of some sort
>"Surprise! It's a cinnamon cheesecake! You like cheesecake right?"
>You nod as you slip on an oven mitt and pull out the baked treat
>"I do Star, but I can't eat it right now, it still has to cool right?"
>She nods furiously
>"Yep! It'll be nice and ready when when you get back"
>You smile and carry star to the chair and set her down in it
>"Love you Star, I'll be back in a bit"
>She smiles happily and starts tapping away at her computer as you slip on the helmet
>The darkness is only cut through by a loading bar that quickly fills
>The HUD flickers on and you head to your bike
>"Anonnnn! Where are you heading anyway?" you hears Stars voice through the comms
>A small window opens in the top right of the helmet screen with a video feed of Stars face
>"Looky Looky! I got a camera so you can see me!"
>She waves furiously to the camera
>"I can see that Star, but why did you get a camera?"
>While it was nice to see her, it would also be a bit distracting
>"So I can do this!"
>She lifts her shirt revealing her breasts to you
>Upgrade that from a bit distracting to totally distracting
>Ever since you had sex with her the first time she had become a pervy beyond compare
>Guess when a weeby girl who had nothing but battery operated boyfriends finally gets the real thing it opens the floodgates
>As much as you would love to oogle her you had things you need to do
>You get into your bike and punch it up the ramp
>"Oooo Anon, don't you just wanna feel these big boobs around your cock?"
>you frown as you steer down the side street
>"I do Star but now isn't teasing time, besides if you tease TOO much, I might just have to turn around"
>She shakes her chest at you before lowering her shirt
>"You assume that isn't my end goal!" she says with a big toothy smile
>She's a crafty little opossum
>Neon lights flow by and rain streaks across you canopy
>Dense fog looking like cotton fills the street, making it hard to see
>Perfect
>Only people with combat eye augments or a helmet like yours could see through this
>Heat signatures and UV would be helpful
>You ride silently as Star taps away on her keyboard
>"Hey Anon, you go to the brothels a lot right? Have you ever been with any of the ladies there? I promise I won't be Made if you did!"
>You frown as you pull into an alleyway going behind the red light district
>"No, I've never been with any of the girls here, not interested in getting any weird diseases"
>Coming to a stop in your bike, you look around, clicking your scanner
>Your scanner is connected to your helmet and lets you change what kind of view you have
>Heat signatures of anyone nearby would show up, very necessary in this fog
>Nothing nearby, but you can see the heat signatures of a few people getting it on and you can see Missy in her office
>Satisfied that you aren't being watched OR getting ambushed, you switch back to plain view 
>Time to do the worst part of dead drops
>Searching for whatever you were looking for
>Chances are it's just a datachip
>And also it would probably just be underneath a box because you doubt Winters wanted to get covered in trash
>After about 15 minutes of searching you find a datachip with the word "NULL" written on it
>Yea this is it
>"Star, info coming to you"  you say as you plug the chip into your scanner
>A few taps and the info is transmitting to the bunker
>As it gets transmitted you can see a few of the defensive measures
>The whole place can go into lockdown, even has an ability to flood the tunnel in and out
>As well the whole area has Implant scanners attached to ceiling turrets
>Looks like they haven't retrofitted the area like some places around the city
>The various crime syndicates had opted for retrofitted security that can actually detect you
>Although you were just one person, they thought you were dangerous enough to warrant all that
>These guys in the arcology obviously thought they were untouchable in the floating paradise
>You were going to prove that wrong
>"Got it Anon! There's a lot here! you coming home now?"
>You can see Star happily beaming in the corner of your screen
>While you were searching she must've gotten some cheetos or something because around her mouth was coated in orange powder
>That or she found some kind of orange candy to boost her already constant sugar high
>"Not yet, I have someone I have to see for this next job"
>Marco, that weasel, better have that beacon for you
>You dial his number and wait for him to pick up
>After about 7 rings he picks up
>You could already feel your frustration growing as you get back into your bike
>"That beacon ready Marco?" you say before he can say anything
>"Ohhh hi Null, I uh... Was just putting the finishing touches on it, you aren't coming over here are you?"
>You know he can see your helmet and not your face but it doesn't stop you from scowling
>"Yes I am, you said a few days, I gave you a few days, did you really think I would just forget you?"
>You carry as much malice in your voice as you can
>There is no time for this bullshit and you have to get to studying the info that Winters gave you
>"Uh N-no Null I ju-"
>"Shut up and get me that beacon or Dismond will be the last thing you worry about"
>You hang up and floor it
>If he didn't have the beacon, you would give him to Dismond; dead or alive
>As useful as he was, Lysander would have another dozen flunkies that could do the same
>You just don't want to owe her another favor, but you will if you have too
>In this world, the world of the crime syndicates that rule the city; you had no room to show weakness
>If even once, someone heard you let someone get the best of you they would try to walk all over you
>It was a culture of honor like in the wild west
>And the best way to deal with it was with sheer brutality
>While usually Gabriel did it, his heavy duty mechanical arm made sheer intimidating a good factor
>He had the reputation for sheer force among those that knew him
>You on the other hand, didn't have strength like him
>So you used everything and anything else
>Sharp things, electricity, fire and lots of bullets
>Once some human, you never learned his name, thought he could sell you info on a mark, and then sell info to the mark you were coming
>You hooked his augments into his apartments electrical system and overloaded his nervous system
>That was a fun time
>You drive through the fog like a shark though a school of fish to the HMS NorthStar
>Once it was the front of the Sailors, Marco lived there to try to stay hidden from the Dismond syndicate
>Now it was ruled by the emperors
>You had no quarrel with them, so they better not give you any problems
>When you finally arrived, you park your bike and get out
>A quick scan of the gangplank and the surrounding area tell you there isn't an ambush set up
>Never can be too certain
>You make your way up the gangplank and see tell tale purple of the emperors
>No subtley at all huh? They went all out to make sure people knew it was their turf
>There are a bunch of the goons patrolling the decks too
>Some are well armed, some with nothing more than bats
>Ignore them for now, no need to deal with them
>You aren't a cop, no need to get into a fight with them
>However you do catch a few of their gazes as you walk through the rain
>Hushed whispers of "Its him, the broken bounty hunter"
>Fortunately they don't do anything besides stare
>"Anon, can you hear them? They keep talking about you"
>You keep walking through as you answer
>"I hear them, no reason to pick a fight with them"
>Even if you wanted to, there were simply too many of them
>You navigate through the ships deck calmly
>Marco's container was close by, on the "top floor"
>Steep metal stairs, hastily made and welded together, climb up the sides of the containers like ivy up the buildings in the rundown
>You climb them quickly, these things always made you uneasy for sure
>But you had places to be and no time to pussyfoot around
>You finally reach the level where Marco's "workshop" is
>Nothing more than a shipping container of top of a bunch of others
>But then again who are you to judge it
>You lived in a single room prior to moving in with Star
>And prior to that you had lived in the streets
>Rain poured down like bullets as you knocked on the door to it
>"Marco its Null, Lemme in"
>A simple "It's open, come in" sets you on edge
>Usually he opens it and lets you in, ushering you through his debris
>He always said something about you might knock over one of his "precious" projects
>The change sets off your paranoia 
>It's not called being paranoid if you survive right?
>A quick click and switch of helmet views tells you why
>You can see the thermal outline of Marco, pointed what you can only assume is a pistol at the door
>Fucking idiot
>If he knew anything about guns, he would know that this door wasn't thick enough to stop a round
>But you're smart enough to know that
>You look around quickly, scanning for nearby peeping Tom's and draw Rose
>No need to start a panic
>Not yet anyway
>You aim through the wall and fire once at Marco's leg
>Screaming howls tell you that you hit your mark
>Music to your ears as you push through the door and shut it behind you
>There is Marco laying on the ground, grasping his bleeding knee
>His shipping container isn't too wide and he is laying on the floor, work benches surround him and parts line the walls 
>Somewhat annoying that he thought he would shoot you but whatever, it was an issue you could live with and have lived with
>"Marco, Marco, Marco...So ready to try to kill me after I asked for so little?" you say, calmly leaning against a wall while watching him writhe in pain
>He scowls up at you, grasping at his still bleeding leg
>"Fuck you Null! YOUR bounty is worth more than the parts I used to make that fucking beacon!"
>So he actually made the beacon? That makes your life easier
>"Where is it Marco?" you ask coldly as you spin the chambers of Rose, not even looking at him
>"Fuck y-"
>You pull off your helmet and set it down on his "workbench"
>It's literally just a board supported by egg-crates
>As you rotate the chambers of Rose a few more times, letting them click ominously until they fall on lethal then you look down at him
>"Where is the beacon I asked for? Last chance"
>Your scowl paints every picture you wanted it to
>A portrait of nonchalant hatred, someone who cared so little for life that a threat would have been useless
>The fear he shows is bliss to you as he attempts to scoot away on one leg
>"It's done! It's done! Over there! Just don't kill me!" as he pleads he points to a corner behind you
>Another trick? A ploy you get you to turn around and show him your back?
>Not gonna work if it is one
>You walk towards him until you're behind him and able to kick his gun away from him
>Ah, there it is
>A shoe box sized box, light strands of thread wrapping around it
>Several buttons adorn it, each with a hastily made label
>You walk slowly and deliberately, facing marco The whole way until you can grab the box
>"How easy would it have been to just give me this and be done with it?" you say with a frown as you holster Rose
>He scowls
>"There are still bounties on you Null, you're worth more dead to me than alive"
>You frown as you grab and pull your helmet on
>"Then you aren't worth anything to me" you say as you pull out your phone
>A quick press of a button and you're ringing Jonathan Dismond himself for a shitty bounty
>As always, he doesn't take long to pick up
>"Anon? What do yo-"
>"Jonathan, I have a bounty here for you, mark my location and send your guys here" you say with a calm frown
>You watch as he is taken aback slightly, then you turn the hologram so he can see the splayed out weasel
>He dings something on what you assume is his desk quickly
>"Very well Anon, do keep us informed"
>You smile as you hang up and the hologram disappears
>Marco's dumbfounded face is what you see as it winks out
>"You have a direct line to Dismond?!" he cries, still grasping his leg
>You give a smug smirk 
>"I'm the ghost Marco, I have connections to everyone"
>You don't but he doesn't know that
>Or do you? You have connections to 2 of the biggest crime groups in the city
>Not an issue you were going to dwell on anyway
>"You sure pissed on the wrong people Marco, me being one of them" you say calmly
>Quickly tucking the beacon under your arm, you frown from under your helmet
>If you let him go he might escape, if you stayed the syndicate would attract attention you didn't need
>Easy solution
>You draw rose once more and aim carefully
>Old world police used this tactic before
>Hit the rotater cuffs and pelvis
>Stop the arms and legs from moving by breaking the bones connected to them
>4 quick shots and Marco is left bloodied and broken on the floor
>Not your problem anymore
>Within moments you're out the door and descending to the cargo deck
>Trying your hardest to disappear into the crowds of the rising sun, you leave the ship
>Luckily you're still smaller than most anthros and their augments
>Before long you're in your bike peeling away from the ship and Marco
>Piss of the wrong people and get the worst of life
>He would learn that the hard way, and it would be a very short lesson
>Morning traffic is always annoying; people scurrying to jobs that don't care about them in an attempt to make a few extra dollars for a life they got sold by their TV
>Literally people working to try to find a life, only to realize at the end of it all that they wasted it
>Not your problem though as you drive down the ramp into your now familiar home of the bunker
>You push up the canopy and step out, only to get greeted by the now more than familiar feeling of Star pouncing onto your side
>at this point you cant even be upset as she hugs your side, her long prehensile tail coiling around your leg
>"I MISSED YOU! LET'S WATCH SOME GUNDAM!" She says happily as you walk awkwardly into the bunker
>It's almost like she didn't just watch you sign the death warrant on someone's life
>As you step awkwardly and sit into the chair, Star scurries into your lap with a smile
>Heart filled eyes are all that you focus on and she snuggles into your chest while interlacing her padded fingers with your own
>"Love you Anon" She cooes softly, all while looking up at you, tiny hearts filling her eyes
>"Love you too Star" you say with a smile
>Quickly looking up at the screens of her computer, you see a quick glimpse of one of her shows
>"Man, I have no idea what's going on in this show" you think as you watch the all too familiar robots blow each other up
>Whatever, at least you understood one thing
>You Love Star, and that's all that mattered

Chapter 6: Nightcall

>You sit in your chair with Star in your lap, frowning as you study the archology
>This place was a nightmare for you
>One way in, one way out, like a Venus flytrap
>Floodgates for the tunnel that went in and out of it, ready to drown anyone
>And throughout there were scanners made to scan unauthorized people or vehicles
>Still they weren't prepared for you luckily
>The "peacemaker" turrets that lined the ceilings locked onto implants
>Robotic security locked onto augments and scanned unauthorized people not with optical means but with the usual implant scanners
>But the whole place could go into lockdown with the flick of a button
>And that...that was controlled by one person,
>The overseer, Josue Alonzo
>From what you could see he got his job through sheer nepotism 
>His uncle was a politician in the world government at some point, only to have been "retired" due to corruption
>Of course you later learned that one of either Lysander's or Dismond's various hitmen had killed him so his corruption was never really brought to life
>Because of that Alonzo's position had stuck, and this was one that stayed for life
>But it looked like he was also inept, given a position of power in a very limited area
>Most likely to keep an eye on him and make sure he doesn't get into trouble
>Would he be an issue for you? Doesn’t matter really
>You don't mind one more body but it was a better idea not to have to deal with that
>Star sat in silence, studying everything with you
>Even she understood what this meant or how dangerous it could be
>You knew getting in was the easy part
>The arcology has a bustling shopping district full of high end things and casino, which also meant strippers and whore
>You were able to piece together that was another reason that Lysander wants this guy dead
>Besides being a pedophile he also was trying to set up a red light district that wasn't under Lysander’s control
>Of course the fact he was a pedo was enough for you
>As well you don’t quite care about Lysander’s business practices either
>With one hand around Star's waist and the other on the mouse, you stare and think out your plan
>From what you could see he loved near the top of the arcology which was shaped like a sphere
>The walls were thick and housed all the apartments
>The center had several levels 
>One with the shopping district, several with the casinos and a few as strip clubs
>All in all it was about 80 stories, 20 floors of apartments for each "center floor"
>The bottom center floor was for shopping, the middle 2 were casinos, and the top was for everything else
>Getting out would be the hard part of this
>IF you were found out, if they found out that he was dead or if you had to deal with security
>Chances are they would put the whole place into lockdown until you were found
>You frown and look over the time
>Midnight
>Time to get going
>The strippers don’t live in the arcology, too expensive so they get brought in at different shifts
>As well the shopping district needed to get restocked
>"Time to go Star" you saw quietly, putting your arms around her and pulling her close
>You feel her long prehensile tail wrapping around your arm as she smiles up at you
>"Ok Anon, I’ll keep a watch out for you and see if my da has any contacts in there!"
>You give her a quick kiss and head to you workroom and start gearing up
>No need for cuffs this time, just raw killing power
>Your rifle was stashed in your bike, your bandolier full of charges ready and waiting
>After Gabriel had given it to you, you had done some work on it for concealment
>Now it was collapsible and easy to hide in your jacket, albeit a bit uncomfortably
>But you would rather carry it for this 
>You head back to the main room where Star stands, bouncing on her footpaws excitedly
>"Come 'ere Munchkin" you say with a smile, opening your arms to her
>With a running pounce Star jumps into your arms with a big doofy smile and her eyes shaped like little hearts
>"Ooo My hero!" she swoons as you hold her close
>The only reason you do this is because you've seen it on one of her various shows
>But she liked it so you don’t mind
>Although you feel her trying to scramble her way up you like you’re a tree
>Her little footpaws are trying to get a grip into your pants 
>Instead you heft her up a little higher so she’s level with you and she puts her arms on your shoulders
>"Stay Safe Anon! I need you here with me!
>You nod at her
>"I’ll stay safe Star, can't leave my valentine alone for too long" you say with a smile
>One of Star's shows (or was it more than one?) had characters with the name valentine
>So you called her it occasionally as a pet name, which she loved
>"When you get back from this mission, you're mine Mister!"
>You aren’t going to complain about that
>One last kiss for the road, sets Star's eyes into little shooting stars, which makes you smile
>You carefully set her down and grab your helmet and slide it on
>Everything is black except a small loading bar that quickly fills, then everything flicks to life
>Satisfied it’s working perfectly, you head to your bike 
>As you reach it your favorite marsupial appears in the upper corner with a bit smile on her face
>"HIIII ANONNN!"
>Yep there’s that usual call that you're used to
>"Hi Star, ready for this?"
>She nods frantically while answering
>"MHM! I’ve got the layout of the arcology pulled and am ready to go!"
>Of course she isn’t literally going but she can feel like she’s out here with you
>After all she is your "comms Officer"
>Besides using her free time to learn how to gain access to systems in places you went, she also watched you work
>It actually helped when you were looking for things, she might spot something you missed
>You get into your bike, rev it up and close the canopy
>The hidden door to the rundown opens as you punch it up the ramp into the outside world
>Heavy rain pushes the fog out of the way, and the plants in the roadway begin to thin as you drive towards the megaway
>Walls of neon lights flank the megaway and giant floating billboards advertise shit people don’t need
>This consumer culture that the world revolved around was something you never really understood
>People working hard at a job they hate to buy shit that no one needs
>Who cares about designer cups and silverware? Why would anyone need a designer Augment that didn’t function any better?
>But at the same time this culture is what kept you employed
>Idiots vying for power and money by exploiting the market and killing those that tried to get ahead
>Even now as you sped towards the arcology you're reminded that getting into it was thanks to the greed and envy of people
>As you approach the exit to the archology you see the advertisements step up
>Instead of billboards its holograms, dancing strippers phase in and out of existence
>Each one using sex to sell anything from fancy cleaning products to pills that "fix" some made up disease
>The rain obscures them a bit when one of the heavy drops hit the projectors
>You notice even as you drive closer and closer to the arcology, the Speeders around you have a step up in quality
>Beat up vehicles are replaced by luxury, well cared for speeders
>Some of them remind you of haulers, but they are made so people don't have to drive them and can walk around in the back
>Guess rich people can't be bothered to even drive themselves places
>The holograms get more and more frequent as you approach the exit off the megaway
>At long last you see the opening to the tunnel that leads to the arcology
>Like giant gaping mouth it yawns wide to swallow you whole
>Different holograms of "famous" strippers and hookers dances around it as you enter into it
>"Wowwwww Anon! Looky looky looky!"  You hear Star proclaim as you click on the beacon you got from Marco
>The tunnels were made of glass or transparent aluminum
>Lights point outwards into the dark ocean showing off varieties of "fish"
>Most of the "fresh" fish that was used for the sushi you like were farmed
>You recall seeing on one of those shows about how stuff is made, giant buildings miles long and wide that were full of thousands of fish farms
>The fish out here in the water were heavily mutated, too much pollution in the water for hundreds of years
>One somehow is able to keep up with your bike as it swims alongside the tunnel, at least 10 meters long and covered in glowing bits and looking like it has 6 eyes
>"Wow it’s so pretty!" you see star swoon in the corner, bouncing excitedly in her chair causing her large breasts to jiggle
>Pretty isn’t the term you would use
>More like disgusting
>There are still large pieces of trash floating in the water 
>Focus
>This is just a distraction from your work
>The tunnel going on for miles gives you a bit more apprehension
>Its one this to see it on a screen and another thing to actually live it
>Even as you feel the tunnel slope upwards, your feeling of unease doesn't go away
>The light at the end of the tunnel is in view and as you finally exit, you take a moment to look around
>Different from the rest of the city, that’s for sure
>The whole place is brightly lit, and made to look tropical, at least on this floor it does
>Because the archology is closed off, no rain or fog blocks your view
>Maybe you would come back at some point to sightsee, and bring Star along with you
>Well actually she probably wouldn’t want to because there was nothing that had to do with her animes
>And you also had no interest in being here
>You steer your bike so you can follow a hauler, taking the hidden routes downwards
>Haulers and other delivery trucks aren't really seen here
>Too unsightly
>So below the main floors there were places for them to park and drive to deliver their wares
>Hidden roads snake their way unseen throughout, which gives you an easy way to get around
>But here you might draw attention on your bike
>Reaching behind you, you flick another switch on the beacon and feel the cloaking field activate
>Ugh they always made you nauseous 
>Some people had them built into their bodies as an advanced combat augment but it always made them really really slow and heavy
>You remember one bounty hunter that had one and would always say "I didn't ask for this"
>Heh what a weirdo
>You keep driving upwards, as the haulers around you thin out
>Perfect, it’s always hard to drive while invisible because other vehicles can't see you
>You reach the top floor of the center areas, the strippers and fledgling red light district
>Parking your bike in a far off hidden area, you get out with your rifle hidden under your jacket and mark the location on the scanner on your arm 
>Your helmet puts a way point there so you can find it later
>These "back" parts of the arcology are totally different than the "front"
>White, and stile, favoring function over form
>It wasn’t pretty but it worked
>"Star do we have any ideas where Jensen is?" you ask as you approach service door to the outside
>You hear Star tapping away at some buttons as you draw your shock knife and jam it into the lock
>The powerful charge short circuits the door lock and allows you to push it open with ease
>"Give me a Sec Anon! I might be able to get into their arcology data recorder network!"
>You blink hard and think about what she just said as you walk through the crowds
>Hm this floor still has gambling and casino machines, beeping, dinging and beeping noises fill the air
>As well the tropical theme has continued to this floor
>"How are you able to get that info Star?" 
>You stop and focus on her camera feed
>"Da has a contact who works in maintenance there! Apparently he's worked there for years!"
>Hm makes sense now that you think about it, Dismond has been trying Control all the Casinos for a long time
>And just like With Lysander trying to get a foothold here, Dismond would want to as well
>"Star, patch me into your father really quick" 
>You skirt around the edge of the crowd, drawing very little attention luckily
>The people here are too distracted to bother with you
>The promise of MAYBE getting a payoff from a lucky draw, the prospect of getting their dicks wet in some whore 
>They had no reason to bother with a single human wearing a helmet
>A new window on the top left of your HUD appears, showing a still image of Dismond
>"Star what do yo-..... Ah Null, I see you're working today, who are you killing today?" 
>You keep walking through the crowd as you speak
>"Senator Jenson, Star tells me you have someone in the arcology that can help me out a bit"
>Star smiles and folds her ears down, you assume she's looking at a hologram of her father
>"I do Null, getting rid of Jenson would be beneficial me, I assume you want to get in contact with him?" 
>"Yea! Da! He needs his help to find the bad guy!" Star interjects, bouncing in her seat 
>"Quiet Star! I was speaking to Null!"
>Immediately the bouncing stops and Star shrinks down in her chair with a quiet "sorry da"
>You frown, disapproving of the scolding Star just received but keep quiet about it for now
>"Yea I need to talk to him, I’m in the arcology and only have a basic idea where Jensen is"
>A tapping noise is heard and you watch Star perk up a bit
>"I’ve sent the contact info to star, when you call him tell him that ace of spades needs help"
>He then promptly hangs up 
>"You Ok Star?"
>She looks a bit downtrodden and her ears are still folded back
>"I...I’m ok... Da doesn't like when I try to do stuff when he has business"
>Was he just brushing her aside or was he trying to make sure she wasn't going into a criminal life
>You think it’s the latter
>"Star, don't let him bother you, I’ve got you" 
>You see her ears perk back up and her scooch back forwards in her chair
>"Promise?"
>You nod calmly as you head into and elevator with lots of people on it
>Let one of them get scanned and get you where you need
>You see Star tapping away then another window opens bring up a man with short black hair 
>"Whoaaa Sup little lady? Also who’s the power ranger?"
>Power ranger?
>You frown and Star giggles 
>"HI!!! Uhmm Ace of spades needs helps!" star recites with a toothy grin
>The man’s eyes widen
>"OH you're with the syndicate? Neat. I'm Chase By the way"
>Star waves at the camera wildly, causing her to shake and certain bits to jiggle
>"Hi! I’m Star! The Power Ranger is An- Uhmm Null!"
>The elevator slowly travels up, floor to floor as they speak
>"Oh, I’ve heard that name before, the ghost right?"
>You nod silently
>As awesome as this helmet was it didn't block your talking, so people around you would hear you if you tried to speak
>"He's hunting Senator Jenson and needs your help to find him" Star chimes in 
>"Aight aight cool I can do that" you watch as Chase types away at a large keyboard
>You wish he would hurry, you're running out of floors as the elevator ascends
>"And here we go! According to the computer system he used his implant to get into Penthouse K on the 79th floor!"
>Quickly, you press the button on the elevator, luckily a few more people are still in the elevator with you
>"If you don't need anything else, I’ll be going, see ya power ranger, call if ya need anything" Chase says before sipping a drink from a can
>Star waves again
>"OK! Thank you Chase!"
>A short click and he's gone
>"I like him, He's Fun! And he called you a power ranger!"
>What the fuck is a power ranger?
>whatever, moving on
>You keep quiet, standing in one of the corners of the elevator as a wolfess wearing black and a man wearing a red hoodie kiss in the other
>Heh someone got lucky
>The elevator dings and opens on the 79th floor letting you out, much to your relief
>Not that you care about PDA but you had other things to think about
>"Inputting the penthouse location into your HUD! Go get 'im Anon!"
>Like magic, a route appears to lead you to your target
>You follow the route noting how this floor is different than the others
>Although still tropical in theme, it was darker, like a deeper recess of the jungle
>More secluded, small artificial hot springs are all around
>There are a few humans and Anthros lazing about in some of them
>What is this place? The Anthros seem...young
>Not like the petite girls you saw at The Lucky Cat, you could tell those ones were older
>But you can't quite tell how old these girls are....
>"Star, get screen shots of all this" you whisper through your comms
>Star looks nearly dumbfounded as you want slowly
>"Star!" you hiss
>She jumps and pushes a bunch of buttons in a panic
>"Yes! Sorry!"
>These guys aren't your target and killing someone without a bounty on them might get you in trouble, especially here
>But if they had bounties, you were going to kill them
>If not you could send these photos to Winters
>At least then he might be able to do something
>You press onwards, following the route to your prey
>Before long you’re face to face with a door with the words "penthouse K" on it
>Shifting to the thermal imaging mode on your helmet shows you several people in the penthouse
>One is small and appears to be cowering
>One is about 6'0 and human from the looks of it and near the small figure
>The rest are either lazing around a TV hologram or something towards the back of the apartment
>How to do this without drawing a crowd
>Maybe just ring the doorbell?
>You press the button next to the door and draw Rose and shift the chamber to stun
>As well you draw your shock knife
>One of the lazing figures gets up and saunters over
>A Click back to normal vision on your helmet and you’re ready
>The door swing open revealing a jackal with mechanical legs
>Speed is your forte here
>You grab him and pull him forwards sharply, causing him to fall forwards with a sharp yelp
>As he hits the ground you stab the shock knife into his mechanical leg, the overload them with a high voltage charge
>The shock also knocks him out
>But his yelp is a problem
>You drag him into the penthouse quickly and  check to see that you weren't heard
>Cheering is heard from the room the jackal came from
>Must be some sports game or something on
>Leave the idiot where he fell and deal with these ones before they cause you a problem
>Quietly you walk over to the door frame and peek inside
>1 human, a wolf and a hyena are cheering walking WWE or whatever that stupid wrestling show is called now
>Honestly don't they know that's fake?
>Fuck it you're inside now, no need for stealth
>As you step out from behind the doorframe you Aim and Fire 3 stun rounds
>All 3 go down like a fat guy going down on a cake
>But it was loud, Rose might be powerful but she isn't quiet
>You can hear shouting from the room where the small figure was
>Let him come
>Quickly you head into the hallway and wait
>Out of the door at the end of the hall burst a man wearing a shirt and no pants, revealing augments to certain places
>You recognize him as your mark
>"What the FUCK is all that rac-"
>His eyes go wide when he sees you
>"Oh FU-!'" his words are lost to you because you charge him and bash him in the face with Rose
>Surprise motherfucker
>He falls backwards into the room, hitting his head on the tiled floor
>You stand over him with a frown
>As quick scan of the room shows no one around
>That can't be right
>You distinctly remember seeing someone else
>Not your problem
>You dial up Lysander on your phone and wait until her hologram appears
>"Ah Anon...Burning the candles at both ends I see" she growls with a low yawn
>"Sorry if I woke you Madam, but I’m sure you have a request for this" you say as you remove your helmet, clicking it off
>You rotate the phone so Lysander sees the senator, who lays on the ground grasping his face
>What a wuss, one pistol whip and he acts like he's dying
>So this is what it’s like to be bitch made
>But then again you recall plenty of men who begged to you, like you would spare them
>Not that you would
>"Get me his ID implant Anon, make it as painful as possible" 
>It’s hard to see past Lysander’s stoic yet graceful voice
>It’s like she could tell you that your family had been killed and you would be ok with it
>You nod silently and double check to make sure your helmet is indeed off
>Star doesn't need to see this, she knew you were a killer; but her shows would never prepare her for this 
>As you go to hang up the phone, Lysander stops you with a simple "wait"
>Your thumb hovers over the "call end button" as you frown at the hologram
>"What?" you ask, irritation permeating your voice
>You wanted to get this over with and go home
>This earns you a smirk from the large saber-toothed feline
>"I want to watch you do it"
>Would you submit to such an odd and ridiculous request?
>She was literally asking to watch you torture someone
>But as you see a pair of eyes peek out from a closet, you know you don't care
>"Close your eyes and hide" you say to the feline cub hiding "don't open them no matter what you hear"
>Lysander's terrifying visage stares at you intensely
>"There is one there now?" 
>A slight break in the calm voice, a chink in her otherwise perfectly calm demeanor
>You turn the phone so she can see the cub, cowering behind a door
>"There is"
>The face Lysander makes is enough to send shivers up your spine
>A mix of cold fury and hatred
>A reminder she was not someone you wanted to cross
>"Make. It. Hurt." is all she says in response
>Get the ID implant huh? Easy
>Make it hurt? Also easy
>You calmly set your phone down on a nearby bedside table and draw your fusion sword
>"No.....use that" Lysander’s hologram lazily points to your shock knife
>Whatever
>You stash the fusion sword and draw your knife calmly
>Best not to piss off a murderous crime lordess
>The disgraced senator tries to retreat from you as you advance towards him, crawling away helplessly
>"Scream for me Jensen, make his job all the sweeter" you hear Lysander chide from behind you
>You hoped he didn't for the sake of the cub
>Even as you catch up to him, he tries to fight
>You catch his right arm and twist it around, locking him into an arm bar
>Body mechanics will always work
>Twist an arm around enough and it reaches its limit, over extending the nerves
>But you don't care about his comfort
>Why should you?
>A swift knee to the back of his elbow snaps his arm, earning you a satisfying scream
>"Shut up" you say calmly as he begs
>How many times have you heard this?
>Spare my life i'll pay you double. Don’t kill me I have a family, bla bla bla
>Fuck that
>Maybe you should have thought about that before you were fucking garbage can
>But still his screams are annoying
>You stomp your boot down on his neck and the side of his face to shut him up
>"Shut. UP"
>The crack of bone from somewhere beneath your foot makes you smile a bit
>Grasping your knife firmly you cut away at his flesh until the bone is exposed while ignoring the frantic kicking of his feet
>Just like whittling except instead of wood its muscle and sinew
>The only resistance her can offer is pained whimpering
>"I’m using my fusion sword for this part, cutting through bone with a knife is a bitch" you say to Lysander’s attentive hologram
>"Very well get it done and throw him out the window"
>No second invitation is needed
>Drawing the fusion sword with a flourish to not cut yourself you quickly dice apart the bone around the implant, leaving his arm to flop uselessly
>His implant might be useful to you for later, Plus Lysander wanted it
>Looking down at the now mutilated senator, you see he passed out from the pain
>Shock maybe?
>Not like you were going to treat it or resuscitate him
>A quick look around makes you frown, there is no window
>Time to improvise
>Leaving his body, you cut a hole through wall to the outside world
>The rain pours through the window you made as you walk over to the senator and heft his body up, careful not to get any blood on you
>If he survived this fall it would be a miracle
>If he survived the things that lived in the waters below... well then you would stop hunting him
>He would have earned life at that point
>But that wasn't going to happen
>No one could survive a nearly 80 story fall 
>Even if it was onto water, surface tension would make that water feel more like stone
>You set him in a seated position at the edge of the hole and wait for the water from the rain to awaken him
>It takes a bit for him to regain consciousness
>He blinks in confusion and attempts to open his mouth but his jaw falls lopsided
>Heh guess you broke it with that stomp
>"Wime to die senator" you say with a smile "Any last words?"
>Before he can even answer, you push him out the hole
>He probably couldn't speak anyway, and you didn't care what he had to say
>"Lysander what do you want me to do with this Cub? I can't bring her with me" you say as you walk over to your helmet and set it on
>"If you would Null, Let me speak to her" you hear as the helmet boots back up
>Walking to the phone and then carrying it to the closet, you set it in front of the cub
>"Open your eyes little one" Lysander coos to the shaking cub
>The cub opens her eyes and stares at the hologram
>"Little one, a drone will be by to pick you up and take you from there, stay put ok?"
>Its weird hearing Lysander speak like this, as well her voice is soothing even
>Weird
>The cub nods once and huddles further into the closet
>Job done, time to go
>You pick up your phone and leave the closet as Star returns to your camera feed
>"Anon! Did you have to kill the feed! I was enjoying watching you!" She pouts, little flames in her eyes
>You look at the bloody spot on the floor and the hole in the wall
>"You didn't need to see that Star, Trust me"
>Walking through the penthouse once more to the exit quietly, you think about how easy this was
>But as you walk by the room with the idiots in it, you see something that catches your eye
>Weren't there 3 of them in there?
>Right as a red light flares to life and sirens go off
>"You're fucked now boy!" you hear a growl behind you
>You turn and see the human, his cybernetic arm limp at his side
>And he's just pressed a panic button...
>And he’s also right
>You. Are. Fucked.

Chapter 7: High Hopes

>Anger flares to life in you as the sirens and red flashing lights distort your perception
>Rose's muzzle flashes brightly as you dispatch the man
>You should have just killed him when you had the chance
>How he recovered so quickly from the stun rounds, you'll never know
>Not like you can ask him now anyway
>"Anon! Ohh No the Place is going into Lockdown" Star says as red lights fill her camera feed
>Her eyes are bright yellow exclamation marks as they dart around her monitors 
>”Thank you, Star I hadn’t noticed” you sigh
>Fuck this, Rose might be a great gun but you need more
>You grab your Auger rifle off you back and extend the collapsible stock
>Clean up time, if you were going down, you’re taking these pedos with you
>Running quickly to the door, you push it open and look around
>Dozens of Security drones buzz about, scanning everyone, searching for you
>A single red eye sits on a sleek body, flanked by 2 thrusters that rotate freely
>Heh
>They wouldn't find you that way
>The men lazing in the pools are still there, unconcerned with the flashing lights and security drones
>They think themselves untouchable, the drones here will protect them they think
>At least that’s what you think they think
>You stroll lazily to the edge of one of the pools, the light glinting off the wet rocks
>Security drones fly around you and past you, searching
>You stand at the edge of the pools, frowning and looking down at a male Anthro hyena, groping what to you looks like a cub
>Anger
>It isn't until you literally push a drone away that he notices you
>Seeing his ears drop in realization of who you are is some semblance of comfort
>"ITS TH-" are the only words he can gasp out before you stomp your boot into his face
>"Get them Love! They ALL have bounties!" you hear Star cheer as she bounces in her chair
>The red lights flash like a rave of old as you get to cleaning up the trash
>The screams are drowned out both by the sirens but also by the water as they sink into it
>You see the bodyguards of whoever these people are begin to mobilize, moving towards you
>They are bigger than you, stronger than you and better armored than you
>What do you do now?
>Fix Bayonets!
>You duck behind one of the faux rocks and attach your Fusion sword to the muzzle of your rifle and light it up in a flash
>Even with your added weaponry, you don't stand a chance though
>You hear kinetic rounds ricochet around you 
>Stay hidden, stay patient 
>They think because of their augments they can get close
>They think you're nothing
>But as you look at one of the Cubs huddled for cover
>You awaken every monster, every dragon every demon that sleeps inside you
>Remind them what hell looks like
>You jump out and fire off a force barrier and smile as the bullets plink against it uselessly
>The plasma rounds from your rifle phase through the barrier and tear through your assailants
>"Behind you!" you hear a male voice call out
>You don’t even question it
>Whipping around quickly, you thrust your rifle and fusion sword bayonet into a huge panther Anthros chest
>"How...?" he manages to choke out before you pull downwards, splitting him
>You run for concealment, avoiding the drones that fly uselessly
>They might not be able to target you but you still don’t want to get winded by one by running into it
>"Yo power ranger, stairs are to your right, in that corner behind a wall" comes the voice again
>Wait... Power ranger?
>As you dash into the corner and push the wall out of the way, you gasp out a simple name
>"Chase?"
>You hear a few claps and a laugh
>"The power ranger speaks! I got back into your comms when I heard the alarm go off" he says with a laugh
>In the corner of your HUD you see Star Scrambling and pushing buttons
>"I? What? HOW?" she says finally, looking frazzled and staring at her camera 
>"The power ranger is in my world now! I have taps on every comm in the arcology" Chase says finally as you run down the stairs
>"Whatever, how do I get out of here now?" You grunt
>Fuck stairs, but you have places to be
>All of them being not here
>"Chill, only a few people know about the stairs, no one can find you there" Chase says lazily
>He knows where you are... How?
>As you slow down, you look around and scan for cameras but find none
>"Look up power ranger" 
>You look up and immediately slash your fusion rifle bayonet at a buzzing security drone
>It flies out of the way with Chase shouting "HEY HEY STOP IT" 
>You keep your rifle trained on at the drone buzzing drone
>It's...painted? 
>What is this?
>"Say hi to Obie! It’s so I can keep track of this place without leaving my station"
>You lower your rifle and see a few of the mods made to the drone
>Several stickers and modifications are on it
>Including an optical camera
>Interesting
>You frown under your helmet and look away from it, continuing your travels down the stairs
>"What can Anon do now?" Star says, frowning at her camera
>Little question marks fill her eyes as she types away at her computer
>"I don’t think He can just leave, I think the security systems are in place" she says finally, little teardrops filling her eyes
>"He can't, he's trapped" chase says more cheerfully than you like
>"What do I do then" you grunt as you continue down the stairs slowly
>"You're gonna have to convince Mr. Alonzo somehow"
>Great
>You were going to have to deal with the overseer of this whole place
>A problem you didn't want to deal with
>Overall it was an easy task, find him and "convince him" you needed to leave
>All the while avoiding drones that weren't made to get you
>"Where" is all you say calmly
>No need to get worked up, no need to freak out and stress
>Just do what you do best
>"Well actually, it's back up a few floors power ranger, hope you like cardio"
>You swear to yourself as Star frowns, little fires filling her eyes as she talks
>"You couldn’t have said that when he walked past it?!" she says angrily 
>Honestly her anger to you is adorable, for you it usually resulted in you giving her head scratches or kisses to sooth the fires in her eyes
>But at this point you're annoyed too, plus you can’t sooth the little fires in her
>You hear him yawn and type away at his computer
>"Forgot sorry, but ya go up like 3 floors and you'll be on the floor he's on"
>You frown and head back up the stairs swearing to yourself in mumbles as Obie follows you lazily
>Three floors doesn't take the wind out of you, but it’s still annoying as you push the door open to the floors
>These access doors were hidden like on the top floor
>As you close it behind you, you note how well it blends into the wall
>You’re still near the of the arcology, but this floor seems more like a in-between station
>Not covered in the tropical designs and mood lighting, but bare and bland like the hidden background
>You see rows and rows of security drones in their docks, charging and ready to be deployed
>Holographic filters block the views into this floor but allow the drones to fly out freely 
>"This is where the overseer is, his office is on the other side of the arcology" you hear Chase say calmly
>You flick off your fusion sword and stow your rifle as you walk between the rows of inert security drones
>This place really does have top notch security... there are hundreds of these drones buzzing around through the various floors of the structure, yet there are still hundreds charging here
>Was this why Lysander had sent you to do this? She had hundreds of bounty hunters across the city and therefore across the planet
>But it would take and army to get through these drones
>You walk forwards and inspect one, noting how the lens of the drone reflects your helmet
>These were top of the line and very useful
>"Chase...do these things fly in the tunnel in and out of the arcology?" you ask calmly, looking over the various pieces and the charging port
>"Huh? Oh uh, yea those things go all over"
>"Are you able to activate one and have it follow me? I can have it cloak my bike as I leave"
>"Uh...no but...I can tell you how to hook your scanner into it so the midget there can pilot it or something"
>You watch Star's eye erupt in little flames
>"I'M NO MIDGET!" she yells angrily, however any intimidation she would have had is ruined by her voice getting higher as she gets madder
>You didn’t want to lose your scanner but this was dire
>Even though you had the cloaking beacon on your bike, they might be searching for them and would flood the tunnel
>With a security drone hiding your movements it would give you the chance to slip by
>Maybe
>"Fine, tell me how"
>For the next hour or so, Chase explains to you how to connect your scanner into the Drones systems
>Honestly you have no idea what you’re doing as you plug various wires in and bits
>Finally you click the final part in place 
>The drone buzzes to life as you watch Star's camera feed
>She has a game controller and has a big smile on her face
>"Ooo Fun! Let me just try this!" she says as she moves a few joysticks
>"The drone shoots forwards suddenly into your chest, knocking the wind out of you and causing you to fall
>"Ow Star! Be careful!" you groan as catch your breath again and get to your feet
>"Sorry Anon! That was an accident! Let me get used to this!" Star chirps happily as the drone slowly buzzes around you
>You watch as she flies at around a bit
>"Ooo it's like I’m there with you now!" Star says as she bounces happily and kicks her feet in joy
>You sigh, and head back to the stairs
>This way, you don’t need to kill anyone else and possibly raise more alarms
>After all you weren't here for anyone else
>Star's drone buzzes awkwardly behinds you, shooting forwards then stopping randomly while hovering
>You sigh as you walk
>Was this worth it? All of this, to help star find her mother; a woman who disappeared after leaving Star with her father?
>Her father, a Man who pushed her aside for his business and hid her from the world
>Just doing this for Star, you had already killed how many?
>How many times have you been shot at to try to find a woman you don't even know is alive
>Star seems to forget that, despite your ability to escape death a few times that you are just a human
>And the most basic human at that
>If any of these drones could spot you, you wouldn’t stand even the smallest of chances
>They would turn you into less of a body and more of a pile of mince mean mixed with bullets
>As you walk to the hidden door to the stairs, you look at Star, who happily pilots her drone
>Would she think it was worth it if you died doing this for her?
>She always forgets or can't put it together that you're out here killing living people for money
>Like when a news reporter forgets they are watching a real tragedy unfold, she forgets you aren't from one of her shows
>The stairs fall away as you walk upwards to your bike
>What repercussions would you being here have?
>You infiltrated the home of a senator, killed at least half a dozen people and set off an alarm on what was supposedly one of the most secure places on the planet
>More people would hunt you, more people would want to be the one to catch the ghost and raise reputation
>But could they find you? Would they stand a chance? You have the backing from 2 major crime syndicates
>At last, you're back on the floor where you left your bike
>"I’ll drive slow Star, can you lock onto my location using the beacon to follow my bike?" you ask as you finally reach it
>"Uhmm I think so!" she says nervously, as the drone buzzes overhead
>Better than nothing and this was your best choice
>You get into it and rev it up
>Slowly, you drive down the ramps, in-between the Haulers and car's trying to leave the arcology
>Everyone is trying to leave, they hear one alarm and flee like rats from a sinking ship
>In-between the lanes of speeders and haulers you go, all while Star pilots the drone, masking you from the other security drones
>Maybe you could do this!
>The checkpoint is ahead, scanning speeders and their occupants, reading the chips of the speeders
>No actual people, just a large scanning system
>Each time a speeder passes under it, there’s green flash; signaling that it's good to go 
>Cautiously, you drive under one, still cloaked and with Star's drone above your bike
>No reaction, no flash of green or anything else
>It can't see you!?
>Good!
>Now you just have to avoid every speeder
>You drive quickly through the tunnels, with the drone following you, luckily Star figured out how to control it in a straight line fast enough 
>Granted you weren't going top speed but still
>You're home free! 
>You drive quicker, a feeling of hope and the desire to shower intensifying as you near the mouth of the tunnel
>But that feeling is shattered as soon as you pull out of the tunnel
>There is a roadblock, waving cars through
>What? This wasn't part of the security
>You stop on the shoulder of the bridge and watch for a moment
>Men, actual humans and Anthros are scanning each vehicle intently
>That is until one points your way and the men raise their rifles at your Bike
>What the? 
>"Uh Anon I think they know where you are" you hear Star say in a worried voice
>This isn't right, the beacon should keep you unseen! And you don’t have an implant....
>Wait....
>You rummage in your pocket and pull out the senator’s implant
>They tracked you...
>You were so used to not being able to be followed you forgot about it
>The drones on the arcology knew not to attack that implant so they ignored you then
>Guess it was too easy after all
>"UNCLOAK AND STEP OUT OF THE VEHICLE OR WE WILL OPEN FIRE" you hear a megahorn Blaze to life
>FUCK
>"A-Anon? What are you gonna do?" Star whispers, you see her in the corner of you HUD, wide eyed and full of fear
>"You have a plan right?"
>You sigh and uncloak your bike
>"No, I don't Star"
>You step out of your bike to the blinding lights
>"Ya caught me" you say calmly, raising your hands
>"Open fire"
>Huh?
>A something hits your bike, causing it to explode and a blast of plasma and shrapnel
>You're floating, flying...
>How odd, why is the sky at your feet? Why is the bridge getting farther away?
>Falling?
>How high was the bridge again?
>Your back hits the cold seawater, feeling more like cement than water and the world goes black

Chapter 8: Into The Light

Star

>"You have a plan right?" you say, watching As Anon's bike slowly gets surrounded
>He has to have a plan, He always did! Nothing ever stopped him!
>Even when Fox was hurt, he never stopped!
>Just like the heros from your shows, he never stopped
>"No, I don't Star"
>Your heart stops, frozen; as you watch him slowly get out of his hoverbike
>No No NO! This isn't right! he's the hero! he always has a pl-
>"Ya caught me" He says with his arms raised above his head, not to you, but to the men surrounding him
>He has to have a plan! He always does!
>Oh! Maybe he thinks they hacked your comms! yea! He's just playing it cool!
>Yea! That's your Anon! he always knows what to do
>"Open fire"
>You watch as Anon drops his arms in confusion
>A rocket hits his bike and...He's gone
>Sent flying over the edge of the bridge as his bike explodes
>You pilot the drone he hacked for you quickly
>You have to catch him! Or Something!
>All you can see in the moments where you're able to fly the drone over the edge of the bridge, is him hit the inky black water and disappear beneath it
>"ANON?!" 
>Static
>"ANON PLEASE ANSWER!"
>Still more static
>Your drone hovers aimlessly above the water where he disappeared
>This was supposed to be fun and games! He even got you a new toy!
>This drone to follow him around and really see what he was doing, like a video game!
>Instead...
>Instead he was...
>No! He couldn't be gone!
>He is unstoppable! He is the Broken bounty hunter! He is the ghost
>He is...yours...
>He...was...human
>Tears fill your eyes as you control your drone, buzzing around frantically, calling to him through your microphone
>Where was he?!
>His helmet wasn't sending a signal! 
>All you saw was static from his feed
>You are Star Dismond
>And Anon is gone
>You bring your paws to your face in disbelief
>NO! Do something! Anything!
>Call uhm...Gabriel! He would know!
>Frantically, you punch in the buttons on your computer, Anon's best friend (Besides you) would know!!
>In a sleepy haze he picks up, you see his hologram looking more tired than usual
>"Star? uh, Whats up?" he says groggily
>"Anon is Gone! I need to find him"
>This snaps him awake
>"Gone? What do you mean?" he says sitting up
>A slight stirring besides him makes him look away from his phone
>"No its ok Fox, One sec" he says before sliding out of his bed and getting dressed
>"Tell me everything Star" he says as he pulls on his jacket

~~~~~

>Gabriel is here with you in your bunker
>He sits reviewing the footage from your drone, a frown on his face
>"We need to go find him" he finally says
>You're shocked, find him? Out there? WE?
>You raise your paws and wave them frantically in front of you
>"No no no! I can't leave my bunker without Anon! It isn-"
>Gabriel rounds on you, anger covering his face
>An anger you rarely saw
>Once from Anon, when you tried to convince him to not attack the sailors...A few times from your father..
>"Null was out there because of YOU Star! Searching for a woman that you've never even met!" he roars
>You shrink back into your chair
>Out there was bad! Out there was where Anon was hurt!...Out there was...Where he needed you
>You bring your paws to your face and rub it, trying desperately to find another option
>What would Anon do out in your place?
>The thought of him diving into the water without a second thought hits you instantly
>He would do that...He never had an issue putting himself in danger for others
>You recall watching him fight at the brothel he usually went to for extra cash, killing a few people for some sluts that he didn't know or care about
>But he always came back, bloodied and bruised, but back to you
>Gabriel stands taller than you, looking down at you with a frown
>Slowly, you nod at him
>"O..Ok Gabriel, lets go"
>You grab your jacket and an arm scanner like Anon always used, however this one could control the drone he acquired for you
>How many times have you been to the surface since Anon took you out for sushi that time? Honestly, you had lost count
>But it was always with him
>You climb into Gabriel's speeder and he starts it up
>In a flash, he's driving towards the bridge Anon disappeared from
>No...Not disappeared
>Was blown off of
>As Gabriel drives, you control the drone and keep an eye on the inky waves of the water, hoping he will reappear
>Continual scans for the signal his helmet gave out so you could talk to him found nothing 
>The holograms Anon had seen less than a few hours ago dance as rain falls through them
>The vehicles from whatever force, that had stopped Anon have dispersed, and now a group of flying robots tend to the crater where his bike had been
>Gabriel pulls to the shoulder of the Megaway bridge and gets out, grabbing a pair of some kind of binoculars out of his bag in the back seat
>"You keep looking with that drone of yours, I got these thermal goggles, if I see something, I'll tell you and you get that drone over there" he says sternly
>you nod and tend to searching with your drone
>He was out there, You knew it! And you were going to find him

Gabriel

>You told Star to sit in the Speeder while you "searched" for Null with your "thermal imaging goggles"
>Truth is, that explosion probably knocked him out and when he hit the water he drowned
>And if it hadn't, It would have done a lot damage to him, enough to make him bleed badly
>Whatever was in the water wouldn't pass up a free meal, that blood would attract them to him
>Null was gone, You were only out here to see if you could maybe find his body and give him a proper funeral
>But Star didn't know that, how could you tell her he was probably dead?
>Your phone rings and up pops the Hologram of Fox, who has a worried look
>"Any chance?" she says, a paw to her chin as she looks at you
>You could tell she already knew the answer but was hoping she was wrong
>"I doubt he's alive, I doubt his body is in one piece either"
>She swears under her breath as tears form in her eyes
>"Find...Something, anything, please Love" she finally says "We owe him that much"
>You nod calmly, "I'll keep in touch, love you"
>She gives a sad smile "Love you too"
>You look over your shower and see Star, searching intently for Null with her drone
>This poor girl doesn't realize he's probably dead, she's too desensitized by her shows to know that people don't usually walk away from explosions
>But you didn't have the heart to tell her that
>Instead, you hoped her seeing the crater in the bridge where is bike had been would tell her he was dead, however it looked like it just encouraged her more
>So you peer into the dark water, trying to distinguish the random chunks of trash from a body, or body part
>you couldn't tell anything apart from anything else
>How long should you keep searching? Would the waves carry his body to the shore? Or would it be sucked underground into the cooling systems of the eternal city?
>Turning away from the water, you look to the area where he had been standing and see something; Something that fills you with more sadness than you thought it would
>Even as you walk close to it, skirting through traffic to pick it up, you can barely believe it
>Rose
>Null's Handgun, one side of it scorched and blacked by the plasma explosion from his bike coils, the other side clean from where it has been pressed against his body and in his holster
>"Gabe? Do you see anything? Why'd you go over there?" Star calls out to you from your speeder
>She looks like she wants to run to you, but keeps ducking back inside the speeder when another speeder zooms past
>You frown and quickly make your way back to her, hiding Rose in your Jacket from her view
>"We should go Star" you say as you get into your speeder, staring straight ahead
>"What? But we just got here?! You said that-"
>"Null's gone Star" you say, still staring ahead, avoiding her gaze
>You can almost feel her eyes staring, boring into you
>"How do yo-" She starts
>"Is...Is that Rose?" she says after a pause
>You look down and see Rose's grip sticking out of your jacket
>Fuck
>Slowly, you reach down, Unload it, and hand the now blemished handgun to Star
>Her tiny paws tremble as you place the it in them
>She's quiet; quieter than you had ever thought she could be, quieter than she had even been
>You stay staring ahead, watching the rain hit your windshield until you hear a small sob 
>Looking over at her, you see something you had never seen before
>Her eyes, instead of the usual happy stars or little dancing flames; are small broken hearts as she stares at the firearm
>tears flow freely as she holds the gun to her, her small paws unable to hold it all
>"He... He must have dropped it, it's ok"
>She begins wiping the dirty side of the firearm frantically with her shirt 
>"We...We have to clean it for him...He hates when his gun is dirty...We'll want it all clean when he gets back..." she says, finally looking up at you
>"Right?"
>You can't bring yourself to answer immediately as you rev up your speeder and head to your apartment
>"Right Star, we'll clean it up good for him" you say with a stone face
>Star didn't need to spend the night alone
>Sure, She might disturb Hope, but that was just a problem you were going to have to deal with later, as you see her frantically trying to use her shirt to clean Rose
>The gun itself was scorched, it would take a lot more than wiping it with a wet t-shirt to clean it
>But you weren't going to stop her from trying
>IF she focused on that, she wouldn't really focus on Null
>Rain smears across your windshield as you drive and Star quietly sobs, trying desperately to clean the firearm
>This isn't how bounties were supposed to end, Null was basically untraceable
>You had watched him literally walk past grounds of security drones, flicking them off as he walked by
>Someone must have been onto his movements, while he couldn't be tracked, he wasn't invisible
>And he had been snooping in some pretty dangerous places again
>He should have brought you...But you know he didn't because of this very reason
>You had Hope to take care of, and now Star to look after in his place
>He didn't tell you about this because he knew if he could pull it off, only HE could
>Implants and societies reliance on them were but Null's biggest weakness and greatest strength
>Going into one of the most protected places in the city was pushing his luck, and that gamble didn't pay out
>Holograms turn to Neon signs as you drive away from the arcology and Null's grave
>You grimace as you think about it
>He never had a chance to fight back, he had surrendered
>If it had been local police, he would have gotten arrested
>He would have shown why he was there, along with the bounties he collected
>Sure the killing of a senator would have landed him in hot water, but as soon as the footage of that senator with a cub popped up...
>Well, he would be a free man
>No, someone wanted him dead
>Well, lots of people did
>But who could organize something like that?
>A sob from Star breaks your thoughts as holes begin forming in her shirt from rubbing it against the charred gun in her paws
>Right...handle that stuff tomorrow, You got into bounty hunter mode
>Right now, Star needed you and Fox
>You pull into the parking zone for your apartment and get out of your speeder, then walk around and open the passenger door for Star, who was too focused on trying to clean Rose
>"Gotta get it clean for him" she mumbles as you gently grab her and lead her out of the speeder
>Not once does she even bother looking up as you lead the crying opossum to the elevator
>Almost like its instinct, she lets the scanner read her implant
>Used to dealing with Null and his affliction no doubt
>You push the button to your floor and wait as the elevator ascends
>When the doors open with a small ding, you peer towards an open window as a gust breezes through
>Null always got caught up in looking out the windows when he visited you
>He was usually stuck below the clouds, in the gutters filled with rain and blood and choked with plants
>But now he wasn't here to admire the view, and you had a small sobbing girl who hadn't even bothered looking up
>You usher Star into your apartment, where she finally looks up
>"This isn't my bunker" she says in confusion, looking around 
>"No it isn't, you're gonna stay here with us tonight" you say, disconnecting your mechanical arm and setting it aside
>Fox emerges from your bedroom with a small yawn, then looks at you 
>You know from her eyes what she's asking and you shake you head solemnly
>She looks down to Star and her eyes widen at the sight of the pint sized opossum still trying to clean Rose
>"Star...Star! Why don't you put Rose down and let's get you to bed, come on" she cooes calmly to Star, her best motherly voice brought forth
>Fox quietly reaches for the handgun, only for Star to pull it away from her
>Star looks at her and seems startled, like she just realized Fox was there
>"Hi Fox...No...No I need to clean this for Anon...He likes it clean" She says before looking back down at the scorched firearm, tears still dripping from her eyes onto it
>"Let's at least sit down on the couch" you say, leading her to your couch
>Star sits down on and you sit on one side of her, while Fox sits on the other side
>Fox puts one of her arms around Star and pulls her in
>"It's ok Star" she whispers sadly to the Small marsupial
>"It'll be ok"
>Star simply nods and continues to focus on Rose
>Turns out being woken up in the middle of the night to be told your best friend died is pretty tiresome
>You feel sleep coming for you, despite you trying to fight it off
>Putting your arm around Star and fox, you pull them close with a yawn
>You fall asleep, listening to Fox gently console Star
>Fox's word echo as you drift off
>"It'll be ok"

Chapter 9: Never Too Young To Die

>It's been nearly a week since Null got blown off the bridge, and any hope you had of finding his body was gone.
>You had called in favors with the cops, other bounty hunters, and even some gutter runners you knew.
>The chance to find his body was small from the start, but you didn't want to give up so you could give him a proper funeral.
>Star spent the nights at your apartment, focused solely on trying to clean Rose.
>She cooked occasionally, trying to perfect Udon for "when Anon gets back".
>Fox helped her and tried to give her an optimistic encouragement.
>How Star felt right now must be indescribable; the first man to wander into her life and make it better was gone.
>But you knew what had to be done, Null given instructions to you in case of his death, just like you had given some to him.
>Right now, Star sat on your couch, holding Hope and  talking to the small cub.
>"When Anon and I have kids someday, I'm sure our baby will love to play with you! Oh! If we have a boy you could marry him! And then we would all be a family!" she said to Hope as she gently rocked the sleeping cub.
>You needed to stop this, it hurt to see her like this.
>"Star, we need to go to your bunker, I need to show you something" you say calmly, looking at Fox for support.
>Fox nods and sits next to Star.
>"It's important that you go with Gabe. I'll look after Hope" she says softly, coaxing Hope from the opossum.
>Star looks up at you and smiles.
>"Oh...OK, I need to make sure everything is ready for Anon when he gets back, I need to get him a new helmet too" she says, sliding off the couch .
>She walks to the front door, and opens the coat closet, then grabs her jacket and pulls it on along with her boots.
>"Ready!" she says with a smile you could see through.
>Her eyes gave it away.
>Small teardrops were in them, replacing the usual Star pupils she usually had.
>In fact, you dont think they've changed at all since the incident.
>You nod to her and pull on your own jacket then open the front door.
>"I'll make a copy for you Fox, love you" you call over your shoulder as you walk out. 
>Star follows you aloofly, like a lost puppy following the first person it found.
>You feel bad for her for what you're gonna show her.
>But it needed to be done, it was Null's request.
>You lead her into the elevator, and she almost immediately lets it scan her implant, letting muscle memory guide her.
>How many times has she done this with Null? He couldn't use elevators without her unless he shorted them out.
>You know he took Star out of her bunker, but he never told you the extent of it.
>Man, now you wish you could ask him so many things.
>"What are you gonna do if your kid can't have implants?" and "Are you ever going to find your parents?" were among them.
>Both were moot now though.
>The elevator stops and you walk out into the pouring rain, noting its heavier than normal.
>Heavy rain for a heavy heart.
>You get into you speeder and hate this feeling you have in your gut.
>This was it. the "nail in the coffin" so to speak.
>Star gets in the speeder and slicks her blue hair back, flicking water onto the headrest she couldn't even use.
>You start up the vehicle and begin the ride, driving in silence with neon lights and rain flowing by.
>The deafening silence is only interrupted by the sound of Speeders and haulers zooming past in the opposite direction.
>When at last you pull to the hidden bunker door, Star doesn't even acknowledge it; she just keeps staring out the window.
>Even as you park the speeder, she doesn't even seem to notice.
>"We're here Star" you say as you push the button to open the doors.
>They swing open and Star jumps slightly in surprise.
>"Oh...right ok! I'll get Anon's workshop ready" she says, before rushing into the bunker.
>Well, that gave you time to do what you needed to.
>You walk into the bunker slowly, remembering the time you and Fox spent in here; the time after Fox got shot.
>Good memories with Star and Null.
>Now it seemed empty, like everything that should be there isn't.
>Yes, Star was there; but Star wasn't your partner in crime.
>You walk over to Null's computer and begin clicking through the folders for the hidden video.
>God DAMN he kept it hidden, but you can't blame him for hiding it well; Star was in this bunker 24/7 and might snoop.
>At last, you find it.
>ifIamdead.MP4
>Real subtle Null.
>"Star, come here, I have something to show you" you call out down the hallway.
>"HM? what's up?" She says as she pokes her head out of Null's ready room, clenching a shoe.
>"There is something you... we... need to see" you say with a sad smile.
>You know what this is; she doesn't, and that breaks your heart.
>Star settles into her chair and looks at you to start the video, which you do with a simple press of the "play" button.
>And then, there he is; Null, sitting in Stars's bedroom, with Star asleep behind him.
>A hologram of him with a sad smile.
>"Hey guys" it starts with a small awkward wave.   
>"Gabe what is th-" Star starts only for the Hologram to cut her off.
>"If you're watching this, I'm dead" It says, smiling sadly.
>"Of course, I didn't want to die, but I am....was a bounty hunter, it was always part of the risk involved" It says as it looks at the camera, the same cold, sad smile on his face.
>"Gabe...I'm sorry. You were always telling me not to die. sorry I couldn't follow your advice this time; hopefully, if there is an afterlife, I wont see you for a long while. I'll see you brother, take care of everyone". 
>The hologram looks at a piece of paper and then back to the camera.
>"Fox, thank you for always being there for me, Augs or not, you always accepted me for who I was, and that meant the world to me. Gabe is probably saving this to send to you or give to you afterwards, but either way. Thank you, you were one of the best friends I could have asked for, and someone I will always call family".
>He shifts a bit, and something moves behind him as he looks away from the camera.
>"Sorry, I'm filming this while Star is asleep" he says calmly.
>"Hope" he says solemnly, with the first frown he has had during this video.
>"Hopefully you never see this, if not hopefully you're old enough to understand my job, otherwise...I hope you don't remember me at all, and are raised on happy stories of my life and not what it really was like. And if she isn't old enough; Gabe, just tell her I did what's right" he says looking at the paper, making sure he says everything right.
>"And last but not least".
>"Star" the hologram says, folding the paper and then tossing it aside.
>"I'm sorry, but if you're seeing this, I'm not coming back; my work, my job was always one of danger and I'm truly sorry. Chances are I tried, and went out in a blaze of glory for something dumb, but this was the only life I could have. Please.... Don't blame yourself; live on and try to find someone who can have augments, and can be...Better than I am. Know this though....".
>The hologram looks back at the figure behind him and then places a hand on it before rubbing it softly.
>"I will always love you; and I'm sorry, I should have always been there for you" it says.
>The hologram looks down then frowns, before reaching forwards and turning itself off.
>"I'm sorry and I love you" are the last words it says before turning off.
>It shuts down automatically and for the first time, it really hits you.
>Null... Anon; is dead, for real this time.
>Did he push his luck to far? was some group after him?
>Answers you would would never really get.
>But now wasn't time to focus on you, you knew this might happen, Null gave instructions.
>His money would go to Hope, for her college or augments, whatever she decided on.
>You look at Star and see tears forming in her eyes as she stares ahead blankly, at where the hologram had been.
>"Is....He really gone?" she whimpers, looking at you with tear drops for pupils and real tears pouring from her eyes.
>A weight is on your chest as you answer her.
>"I...I think so Star, I'm sorry" you choke out, looking at the opossum with a sad frown.
>Sure, she still had you and Fox, but... This had to be hard on her.
>He was there for her, doing everything for her, even if he said for her not to blame herself, she probably would.
>Plus, you doubt that she would ever find anyone else.
>"But I don't want him to be dead Gabe! Is this how adults do things?" she says sadly, her eyes and nose running, as she looks up at you.
>"I'm sorry Star, but he's dead, and yes, this is how adults do things" you say putting your flesh and blood arm around her shoulder and leading her back to your speeder.
>You felt bad showing that video to her but she needed to see it, but as you lead the now openly sobbing opossum, you feel like maybe you shouldn't have.
>She had spent her whole life sheltered from any real danger, only really seeing violence from Null when she monitored his hunts
>And you just sprung that on her the love of her life is really, truly dead..
>You help her into the speeder, then go grab a bag and throw some of her clothes in it.
>It looks like she was going to stay with you for a while.
>Star needed that support from you and Fox, and chances are you both needed her support too
>While Star was romantically involved with Null; He was your best friend, always willing to give anything and everything for you and Fox.
>It was him who came up with the Suicide mission to kill the leaders of the sailors; not for his own gain or benefit, but for Fox
>You always knew if he died, it would be for someone else.
>Guess you were right.
>He had saved that cub from the pedophile senator; and she would probably never know his sacrifice.
>you get into your speeder and start it up then jet out of the bunker.
>"Call Lysander" you say as you start driving.
>The surround sound of your speeder rings a few times before a hologram of the large sabretooth cat appears.
>"Gabriel, calling at such an odd time? Has Anon finally completed my task?" she asks with a bored look on her face.
>Did she not know? How would she not know?
>"Anon is dead" you say with annoyance poured into your words "He killed the senator, but someone set him up".
>For the first time, you see shock on Lysander's face, if only for a moment.
>"Dead? how can thi-" her voice trails off as she looks up in thought.
>"Come to me. NOW. We have much to discuss" Her hologram says quickly.
>You look over to Star, who simply nods at you and mouths "it's ok".
>Guess you were taking a detour.
>Steering your speeder onto the Megaway, you can only guess what Lysander had to say.
>How could she be surprised at Null's death? 
>Actually that wasn't a surprise really.
>He was untraceable if he wanted to be.
>You recall him saying that if he wanted, he could disappear like the morning fog.
>Just be gone with no way to find him, but he also said he had no reason to do that; he finally found happiness and love.
>The love his parents never gave him, the love the world never gave him.
>All in Star.
>You mull it all over as you drive to the Concordat's mansion.
>No way he would disappear on both you AND Star.
>As Lysander's servants take control of your speeder and drive it to the front of the mansion, you know he would never do that.
>He loved Star, and as much as he would never say it, he loved Fox and Hope.
>And you, in the best brotherly way.
>The speeder comes to a halt and you get out, then motion to Star for her to get out as well.
>"Whatever Lysander has to say, you should hear too" you say to her as some butler leads you both.
>Where was the usual giraffe?
>He leads you to a Library that you haven't seen before, books and what looks like phonograph records line the walls.
>Lysander is looking over a sheet of music notes when you walk in.
>"Gabriel, good to see you and your...guest..." She says looking over the sheets of music at you and Star.
>you nod to her.
>"Hello Lysander, this is Star, Null's girlfriend" you say motioning to Star with your mechanical arm
>Lysander studies Star for a moment then focuses on you.
>"You say Anon is dead, but I have not received word of this, what proof do you have? Are you trying to protect him from his failure?" She says coolly.
>You pull out your phone, where you have his final moments saved and start up the footage of his final moments.
>A hologram appears of Null's Point of view; him getting out of his bike, the rocket hitting and him plummeting into the sea
>"I've spent the last week looking for him or his body, but chances are something got him as a snack" you say, shutting down the hologram with a frown.
>Lysander stays sitting, looking at you with a perplexed look on her muzzle.
>"Someone has been hiding this from me, I should have known right away" she says finally, looking at her various servants.
>She beckons you closer with a clawed and padded finger.
>"I will give you the information Anon wanted, someone is trying to keep me in the dark and they're succeeding, trust no one" She whispers to you as you lean in.
>Great, that's just what you wanted to hear.
>She presses a datastick into your hand and looks to her various servants once more.
>"I may need to check in on my Staff and the company they keep" She growls as she pulls away.
>Her growling was...Terrifying
>You nod at her then take your leave, grabbing Star's paw and leading her out of the mansion.
>People were hiding Anon's death from Lysander? If people were hiding it from her, then someone was afraid of whatever Null would find underground.
>But all he was doing was looking for Star's Mom.
>What else was down there?
>You get into your speeder and then plug the Datachip from Lysander into your phone.
>A hologram of a Building Information Model is shown glimmering above your phone, as Lysander's people drive your speeder to the mansion gates.
>It looks like it's the 3D model of one of the water intake ports for cooling down the city's internal systems.
>A portion is highlighted, showing a hidden door, probably built for the unlikely need for people to go in and perform maintenance.
>The light from the hologram reflects of Star's eyes; her pupils in the shape of little question marks.
>"What's that Gabe?" she says, looking at it in wonder.
>"They look like the original building plans for the Water Intakes, with a hidden maintenance hatch...these must be centuries old..." you say looking it over as Star's eyes turned to small spinning stars.
>"We're going under there?" She says scooching close to the hologram and looking it over.
>"No" you say firmly "'WE' are not, I am; This is too dangerous for you".  
>She actually slams the phone down with her paw, looking at you firmly; and for the first time ever you've seen Star Furious.
>Her eyes both literally and figuratively blazing.
>"I will NOT sit back! Anon DIED for this! I can help! I'm not afraid!" she yells at you, fury in her voice.
>But as you look at her, you see the truth, or at least the truth Star didn't want to admit.
>Her body is shivering in fear, afraid of what's to come...Yet so determined to help.
>Your heart sinks looking at her.
>No wonder Null got along with her so well.
>You had seen this exact reaction from him before when he was younger.
>Just a kid, unaugmented and constantly at odds with the world, just trying to prove he belonged.
>You could say something cheesy like "His heart" convinced you to reach out to him.
>But no, that wasn't it; this isn't one of Star's animes.
>It was his anger that did it; his anger at the world and everyone who slighted him.
>His anger that he had to be an	outcast and not live the quiet happy life you knew he wanted.
>There it was in Star.
>Angry that the world took the only person who really understood and loved her.
>Her eyes were a clear reminder of Null, and you had to look away from them.
>Too many reminders of him, his pain and how he just wanted to live a happy life that was just outside his reach.
>God dammit Null.
>Why did he have to put you into this position?
>"Fine! But you do exactly what I say! NO questions, No poking things you shouldn't" you say, making the hologram disappear as you take control of your speeder once more.
>"We're going now, before anyone can Figure out we have this information" you say to start and start flooring it towards the megaway.
>Star doesn't answer and instead just stares at the speeder floor, her eyes shifting constantly.
>Exclamation marks to question marks to little fires, cycling through quickly like a roulette wheel.
>The water intake that was shown in the Building information model was near the arcology, in fact you can see where Null died from where you pull off the megaway.
>You go through the back alley streets to reach an industrial park, but you feel it's more an urban wasteland.
>No one came here; the buildings here were automated factories that constantly built things; or warehouses that had large drones flying around to deliver the goods produced.
>The sound of rushing water and clanging metal fills the air as you park your speeder in a hidden out of the way spot, behind one of the factories.
>"Come on Star, Lets go" you say, pushing your door open and checking to make sure you have everything.
>Handgun, phone, flashlight, etc.
>The basics.
>"Ok Gabe!" Star chimes, as you begin walking to the intake.
>You hear your speeder door open, what sounds like Star falling out of it then her scurrying to catch up to you.
>Ignoring it, you make your way to the water inlet as the rushing water gets louder and louder.
>The inlet itself looks like a sunken box with one side below water level, 200 foot wide and 30 feet down; creating an artificial waterfall.
>Someone has spray painted large teeth and gums onto the concrete walls, making the whole thing look like a giant devouring maw.
>A ladder leads down into the sunken intake, to a small 2 foot ledge just in front of the roaring water.
>You open the BIM and scan it as rain falls on you and Star.
>It's down there to be sure.
>You hated heights and ladders, but still begin the descent downwards to the ledge.
>"Be careful Star" you say as you climb down the ladder.
>As soon as you get out of her way the short opossum begins climbing down more nimbly that you thought she would.
>Guess her small size had its advantages.
>Once you reach the bottom of the ladder and stand on the ledge; right next to a roaring waterfall, you pull open the Building Information Model once more.
>The key to getting in is right...There.
>You spot the key to opening it as you dismiss the hologram with a wave of your hand.
>A small square stone, set into the otherwise totally solid wall.
>If you didn't know it was there you would have passed right by it, it looks like nothing more than a patch in the otherwise seamless concrete. 
>"Gabe where is th-'. 
>You ignore Star and punch the square firmly with your mechanical arm, cracking it easily.
>Star jumps back in surprise and has to grab the ladder for support as you do so.
>"The way in is right...Here" you say as you pick the broken pieces of stone aside into the roaring water behind you.
>A small hole is revealed, and as you shine the flashlight from your belt into it, there appears to be a handle that someone could grab and twist.
>Problem was, that someone wasn't you.
>The opening was too small for your hands, even you flesh and blood hand is too big to get into the hole.
>Regardless, you try to shove it into the opening only to have you forearm stop you painfully.
>As much as you try to push it in further, you feel it scraping the skin off your arm. 
>"Just ....a little bit ...further" you murmur, trying to push beyond the limits.
>Eventually the pain and the realization that you wouldn't be able to grab the handle hits you.
>To come all this way... Only to be stopped by a small hole.
>You pull your scraped and bloodied arm out of the hole ,then look to Star in defeat.
>"Star I'm sorry but we can't g-" you start.
>Before you can even finish your sentence, Star has plunged her arm into the hole.
>"HEY STAR WHAT TH-" you begin only to hear a rumble and a hidden door lift open.
>"I got it" She says looking at you defiantly " I told you I could be useful".
>The defiance on her muzzle, the anger, the fear.
>Everything you had seen in Null.
>Guess he rubbed off on her after all this time, regardless of the still present shivering from her.
>Next to you the concrete door creakily opens upwards, with dust and debris falling down around it.
>It probably hasn't been opened in decades, if ever.
>But still, there it was, the way into the underground that Null had been searching for, that he has died for.
>"Stay close to me" you say drawing your gun and walking through the doorway.
>It leads to a walkway made of rusted scaffolding that turns to a staircase, which wraps around itself in a downward spiral next to the roaring waterfall.
>After 200 feet maybe; the waterfall crashes against whatever metal the bottom was made of, with the scaffolding leading you on a path above it.
>Like a river, the water flows beneath you and Star as you lead the way.
>The water and the scaffolding lead into a gradual slope, leading deeper and deeper underground.
>How far does this even go? what were you even searching for?
>Yea, maybe Star's mom was in the underground, but that underground was the size of the planet.
>This was a wild goose chase if you ever had seen one, yet you still persist downwards, following the rushing water below.
>Was it because Null died for this? Was it because Star deserved to know her parents, even if one of them was a douchebag?
>Did Null latch on this idea because his own parents had abandoned him?
>Ugh, the idea of it still haunted you.
>He told you the story few others ever heard; in fact you're sure only you and Star had heard it.
>He was 12 and his parents took him shopping for new clothes.
>They sent him to the checkout, saying they had forgotten something.
>He never saw them again.
>The paranoia never faded; he would follow you to the checkout whenever you treated him to dinner or anything like that.
>It was...Sad to say the least; his fear of being left behind was irrational, after all he could have called a ride.
>But overcoming trauma is a hard road.
>Still, you continue downwards, into the dimly lit underbelly of the city.
>How far was it now? 2 miles from the intake? how many meters down?
>Star was panting unhappily when you looked back at her each time.
>But there was a change in scenery before you as you urged her onwards.
>You saw it, a doorway into the Real underbelly of the city
>The water dropped off again to hit a turbine, and onto whatever other systems that it cooled.
>There was a control station full of monitors ahead.
>"This....Sucks" Star pants unhappily as she follows you into the control station
>"Yea it does Star, but you asked to come here; Null wouldn't complain though" you say looking to the various monitors in the station.
>He never did complain, no matter how bad things got but those words make her stop panting and try to breath normally.
>"I'm not complaining!" she says with a frown angerly.
>"Yea, sure you weren't" you mumble, more to yourself than to her.
>Groups of the Emperors are on the screens, just kinda walking around.
>Why were they even patrolling an area that no one knew how to get into?
>You keep looking at the feeds, unsure of what was going on.
>Maybe you could make contact with one of the groups? you had no quarrel with them after all.
>"Gabe..." you hear Star call to you as you scan the various feeds.
>"Not now Star" you hiss, earning a small terrified squeak.
>Sorry Star, but you were trying to come up with a game plan.
>You feel a sharp tugging on your shirt "Gabe.... We have company".
>"What?".
>You whip around and find the barrel of a rifle in your face.
>At least a dozen of the Emperors stand surrounding you.
>"Star, why didn't yo-".
>"I Tried!" she whines, a gun pressed to her muzzle.
>"Well now, finally you show up, I wondered how long you would take" a suave voice you recognize is heard above the roaring water.
>You recognize the voice? Why? 
>the answer is apparent as a tall lanky figure ducks and enters the room you were in.
>You recognize him immediately.
>Jeffrey the giraffe.
>Lysander's personal butler.
>Armed with several grenades and a heavy rifle.
>"You?" you ask flabbergasted.
>He smiles a you.
>"Me, holster your gun" he says with a smug smile.
>you do so, but before you can say anything else, he begins ordering the grunts around.
>"Put them with the other, I knew Lysander would send someone to us" he says calmly.
>The grunts Shepard you and Star Deeper underground.
>"Keep your hands raised, don't try anything" you say to star over and over.
>You can see she wanted to act, to fight; all based on the emotions portrayed by her eyes.
>But that would get you both killed.
>A gun barrel pressed into your back, you're lead deeper underground for who knows how long.
>You aren't focused on anything else besides not getting shot and telling Star it was ok.
>However, after what seems like an eternity, you're shoved into a cell with Star; blocked off by laser beams bars to keep you contained.
>"I call the arm of that guy" one of the anthros who escorted you down says gruffly, taking your handgun from its holster.
>"Naw its junk, too clunky" says one of the others.
>the first gives a soft grunt and leads the rest of his pack, about 8-10 other antros fitted with mismatched augments.
>Damage control.
>"Star, are you oka-" you turn to her and see her eyes are small skull and crossbones.
>Her breathing is hard and ragged as she looks around, hyperventilating at everything going on.
>She locks her eyes on you.
>"Tell me you have a plan... Please I...Please" she says shakily looking at you, the same symbol in her eyes.
>"I don't Star..." you say in defeat, looking at her.
>Fox...Hope... 
>You knew at this point, you were going to die down here.
>All that mattered now, is how painful or painless it was.
>Fox and Hope had your savings, enough to live comfortably when coupled with Null's.
>Another one of your plans in case of either; or both of your deaths.
>Your thoughts are broken by a steady thumping sound.
>Then a voice.
>"Ooooh I'm sorry they tortured you so bad, but it's ok! I healed you up good so you're ok now".
>Thump... Pat...Thump.... Alongside the gentle pitter patter of footsteps.
>Soft mumbling, and more thumping.
>"I know, but my job is to keep you alive, But I'll go talk to the boss lady just because you're so nice" a feminine voice says
>The first thing you see is a fox... Maybe.
>She's average height, covered in a myriad of stitching and a syringe in her dark orange hair, keeping her bun in place.
>Piercing yellow and red eyes study you as she half leads, half drags her "patient"
>A tattered nurse uniform covers her body as she carefully helps a person walk to the cell you're in.
>Concern paints her face as she helps the person.
>"Oh! Looks like you have friends now! Won't that be fun for you! I'm sure they can keep you company while I talk to the empress" the Nurse says happily, her yellow eyes glinting in the low light.
>She lowers the laser force field and gently lays the person into the cell, then quickly stands up and raises the shield again.
>"You better not been mean to my patient or else I'm coming for you." she growls at you, showing dangerously sharp teeth.
>You quickly nod as she disappears, feeling obligated to answer her.
>"Yes ma'am" you say almost involuntarily.
>Star huddles in one of the corners, shivering in fear as the man is let go.
>The person falls forwards as he tries to walk, catching himself on his hands and knees; breathing heavily. 
>"Why would you bring HER here" comes a raspy voice, one strained through hours of screaming but...Familiar.
>"What?".
>The person attempts to stand and take a swing at you, only to fall over pathetically.
>It's only then you notice why there was a thumping noise.
>His left leg; everything below the knee was replaced with nothing but a simple wooden peg.
>And you see the fury and pain on his face as he struggles to get upright and hobble towards a corner of the cell.
>No... It can't be.
>"Null?"
>It takes a moment, but eventually, he turns around
>There he is, half his left leg missing, and from what you can see; his entire left side covered in burns
>a few skin grafts cover the flesh on his neck, which disappear under his shirt.
>That is except for his face, which is painted with a sad, pained shaky smile.
>"Hey Gabe, what took you so long?".


Chapter 10: The Underside

>Rushing frigid water and pain were what you woke to, only the faint memory of what happened on the bridge in the back of your mind.
>How could you focus on anything else besides pain?
>There was so much of it.
>Your entire left side seared with the pain of a thousand suns, which is only offset by the bone-chilling water that poured over you as you struggled to keep your face above the surface.
>One side of you was somewhat comforted by the cold water, keeping the burning at bay; the other side was frozen and shivering.
>Your left leg was caught in one of the great turbines of the city, stopping the mighty spinning wheel from grinding the rest of your body to dust.
>How many hours had you laid there among the flotsam and jetsam?
>No one would ever know how long you suffered, feeling the burns soothed by the cold water, and shivering hypothermia from the same savior.
>Your own tenacity and anger kept you conscious through it all.
>You are the ghost that haunted people, the untraceable monster in the night that anyone who was an enemy of the Concordate or the Dismond syndicate feared.
>Water would not be the end for you, nor would burns.
>Hours passed until you saw them.
>Figures clad in deep purple, walking on a gangway over you.
>The weak call out you gave was enough, it attracted their attention and they pulled most of you out of the caught turbine.
>Your left leg was gone; well, everything below the knee, shredded to bits by the turbine, but saving the rest of your body.
>The men and anthros that threw a rope to you to pull you out of the turbine were nice, friendly even.
>Most recognized you as the ghost, the broken, or just as Null the bounty hunter.
>You had no quarrel with the Emperors, hell you were almost an inspiration to them.
>A lone human with no augments, a man with every disadvantage against him; had somehow taken down one of the most deadly crime bosses in a 2 man team.
>The group carried you to their "nurse" who set upon you with such enthusiasm, making skin grafts and even going so far as to feeding you when your body failed to respond.
>She was nice; one of the nicest people you had met in your life. Treating you like more than an anomaly in the system. 
>But you were famous -err- infamous for your deeds.
>And that attracted him.
>Jeffrey, The giraffe, the wretch, Lysander’s head butler and her top trustee, or so you had thought, heard you were being taken care of.
>You're sure the word that the ghost was there spread throughout the ranks of the emperors, after all they had approached you to join them several times in the past.
>Each time you politely refused, you were with the Concordate, and you knew better than to cross Lysander.
>Each time they bowed slightly, respecting your decision after you promised no ill will towards them, merely self-interest and predisposition to staying alive.
>But... that giraffe, he seemed to not care for the pact and treaty you had with Lysander, nor the one he had undoubtedly gotten into with her.
>To you, it seemed that as soon as he learned you were being held and helped, all of the help and recovery had been peeled away.
>He knew you were seeking a way underground, looking for something, or someone; and so he hated you; no. he hated you regardless.
>You were in high favor with the leader of the Concordate, able to ask things and request favors for favors.
>He would never be anything more than a butler, and he envied you for it.
>And so he took it upon himself to find out why you were looking into the underground.
>The helpful hands that patched your skin from the burns, they turned to claws tearing at the grafts they had given you.
>Well not literally, Carrie was always horrified at what they did.
>Jeffrey was the foremost of your tormentors; digging his hands into your skin grafts that the nurse had so carefully placed to help you heal.
>He asked who sent you peering into the underside of the city; no, he demanded it of you.
>But you knew the consequences of answering his question.
>You would have to give up Star, tell them of the lost and hidden daughter of the Dismond syndicate.
>There was nothing that would make you betray her trust.
>Even as they hurt you so, you couldn't bare the thought of that tiny opossum being captured by these oppressors and tortured for no gain whatsoever.
>No, they would do worse to her.
>If they could do this to you, someone who they had tried to recruit, they would do SO much more to a tiny frail thing like her.
>You knew if you gave her up; Torture, rape and disfigurement would be upon the small toy loving opossum.
>Someone who had never faced real life didn't deserve that.
>So you shouldered the pain, knowing that she would think you died quickly and painlessly in the explosion that destroyed your bike.
>But still the emperor's did their worst to you and you bore it
>Who would have thought having someone physically peel away skin grafts would be so painful.
>Even as the giraffe peeled your torn skin away, you saw the face of your healer, your nurse, Carrie.
>She looked on in horror as they tortured you, showing that this wasn't normal; her eyes were always wide in horror as you screamed until your voice was hoarse.
>No doctor, or healer or Nurse could see this sight for long.
>And each time after they got bored of pulling away at your grafts, they bid Carrie to heal you.
>She was nice, helpful and kind to a fault; but she also knew her duty to this group of killers.
>Each time, after the painful sessions with Jeffrey, she healed you diligently; and each time you spoke to her in hushed whispers.
>"I didn't do anything to deserve this, tell your leader about this please" you pleaded in hushed tones as she bodily carried you to your cell.
>Honestly, at this point they didn't need to put up the force field to your cell.
>Your body was broken and your spirit was in pieces.
>"Ooooh I'm sorry they tortured you so bad, but it's ok! I healed you up good so you're ok now" She said to you as she practically dragged your body.
>What did it matter now? What was your life beyond pain and torture?
>Eventually your heart would give out, or your body would go into shock that Carrie couldn't reverse.
>"They are going to kill me Carrie, please, just tell your leader I am here and seek an audience please..." you murmured, it was the best you could do, you voice long since shot.
>"I know, but my job is to keep you alive, But I'll go talk to the boss lady just because you're so nice" your faithful nurse said earnestly
>She dragged you to your new home, your cell in this underground labyrinth
>To your surprise as you look into it, you see 2 extra figures in it, one huddles against a wall, one towering with a scowl.
>Why were they here?
>"Oh! Looks like you have friends now! Won't that be fun for you! I'm sure they can keep you company while I talk to the empress" the nurse says happily, leaning you against a wall.
>No no NO! They can't be here! This is YOUR tomb... Not theirs.
>"You better not been mean to my patient or else I'm coming for you." comes the nurse’s voice towards your guests.
>"Yes ma'am"
>That cements it then.
>Nurse Carrie leaves and you hear her footpaws pitter patter against the floor.
>That doesn't distract you though.
>You attempt to stand, and with a shaky step, walk towards your new cell mates.
>Except you fall forwards, unused to the new prosthetic of your leg, which is just a table leg. 
>"Why would you bring HER here" you gasp out to the human in your cell.
>"What?"
>Anger flows through your body and you try to take a swing at the man, only for him to simply move back out of your way.
>You fall forwards and catch yourself, feeling the searing pain of your skin grafts as you stretched them more than you should have.
>No don't let them see this!
>You shakily stand up and hobble your way to a corner of your cell, keeping your face and shame hidden.
>"Null?" comes the voice of your best friend in disbelief.
>You turn slowly to face him with a forced smile.
>"Hey Gabe, what took you so long?" you shake out as nonchalantly as you could.
>He stares at you, dumbfounded.
>"N-nu- Anon? You're ali-"
>His words are cut off as a fuzzy cannon ball hits your side, your left side, the one covered in scars and false skin
>"ANONIKNEWYOUWEREALI-" your screams of pain drown out the rest of Star's message to you.
>Star, oblivious to your pain, crashed against you, her claws and freakish anthro strength tearing through your clothes and skin grafts.
>Your only reprieve from the pain is Gabe grabbing Star bodily and yanking her off you, leaving you a panting, now partially bloody mess.
>You stagger forwards to a corner of your cell, looking at the love of your life sadly.
>Why had he brought her here now?
>She didn't need to see you like this, not the broken human that really couldn't amount to anything.
>"A-anon?" she finally choked out, seeing the blood splatters on the floor around you from her claws.
>"H-hey Star, I'm not doing too good, so uh try not to pull at my skin please" you say with remorse.
>After all the pain you had gone through at the hands...paws? Hooves?... whatever, you just wanted to hold your love.
>But she didn't, no, she couldn't understand.
>She would crush and tear at and wreck your still healing body.
>"The explosion from the bike burn a lot of my skin off" you explain, lifting your shirt to show burns.
>You brace yourself with your good hand against the nearest wall, and give the more sincere smile you could.
>At this point it probably looks like the smile of a month old jack-o lantern
>"Nu- Anon... It’s been almost a week since the e-explosion..." Gabe says slowly as you try to find your voice and your strength to stand up.
>He called you by your real name, meaning he was serious, and even if he hadn't just hearing his voice waver once was enough to tell you he was glad to see you alive.
>Also he let slip how long it had been since the explosion.
>What was almost a week? 4 days? 6 days? 9 days? There was no way you would have known, so you just trust his words.
>Either way you don't dwell on them, instead focusing the two in front of you.
>Your best friend, and the love of your life.
>You never told her she was the only one for you, seemed a bit tacky; but not in this situation it seemed like you should.
>But then again you never pictured her in this situation, you always pictured her in her bunker, happily chattering away as she put together a plastic robot.
>As you pant through the pain, Star, the tiny lonely opossum girl you learned to love approaches you slowly.
>"Anon? it’s really you?" she half whispered, half sobbed, looking at you and your burns, then giving you a gentle hug.
>"It’s me Star" you answer, shifting a bit so her hug wouldn’t cause too much pain.
>It still made you feel pain though.
>The feeling tiny arms pressing against skin grafts was immense, and made you gasp out involuntarily.
>Instantly she let go and backed off, looking at you in concern.
>Even Star would put the pieces together as she looked at you.
>You've been gone...nearly a week; and you weren't healed and ok.
>"They've...they've been hurting you?" she finally said, her blue eyes in tiny spinning stars focusing on yours and turning into question marks.
>Why lie at this point?
>"Yes Star, they have been adamant at figuring out who hired me to search the underground" you say with a sunken frown, looking at her and Gabe.
>Why had he brought her?
>"Gabe... Why?" you start only for him to raise his metal hand at you.
>"She insisted, and I never was one to discourage someone so disadvantaged" he said, his steel grey eyes locked on yours.
>God dammit.
>The same logic he used defending you as a partner; used against you.
>Star was NOT like you though!
>She was tiny and brittle and....
>Just like you.....
>Unprepared for the world.
>You give an angry sigh and look at him, then sigh, still leaning against the wall of your cell.
>"So...What now?" you ask pensively, looking between your best friend and your love.
>"Uh let's see what we know about this place" Gabriel says, looking around the cell.
>That's not gonna be a whole lot.
>How long had you been there? You don't know.
>What was the Emperor's goal? You don't know.
>Who was in charge? You don't know.
>Honestly what did they expect for answers?
>You had spent "nearly a week" getting your skin grafts torn from your body and then stapled back on.
>Your left leg twitched painfully, the wooden replacement clinking against the solid metal floor.
>Star looks at the wooden prosthetic than looks at you.
>"Anon...What happened?" she asked, her brilliant lovely starry blue eyes focused on you.
>you sigh and look to her.
>"Are you sure you want to hear it?" you ask calmly, not quite looking at her directly.
>But her starry eyes met yours with determination.
>You gained a new level of respect for your love that...Evening? You honestly didn't know what time it is, not that it mattered.
>"Yes" She said finally, with a look of concern.
>You study her then Gabe for a moment, debating what to do.
>She didn't need the truth of reality. She deserved her anime stories of the main character always coming out on top.
>She needed the stories where a band aid fixed everything.
>Not your torture and hours of pained screams.
>But regardless, you recant what happened to you; minus the gruesome details torture, instead just saying they "hurt you" to Star.
>Her eyes are little teardrops as she listens and Gabriel's face has a dark grimace to it. 
>"And then you guys show up, leaving us all trapped" you say coldly as you sit on the hard metal floor.
>Gabe swears to himself and Star huddles up next to you
>"But at least we are together right?" She says, her eyes flickering to small hearts as she looks at you.
>You want to be mad at her for saying that, how is being together going to help you now?
>You were going to get tortured more, Gabe might have his augments ripped out and Star would get the VIP treatment when they found out who her father is.
>But...She was here with you, and for all the pain you went through, you were glad to see her again.
>"Yea Star I gue-" 
>You halt your words at the feeling of vibrations through the floor.
>You can feel them easier from your seated position and can already tell what they are.
>Footsteps.
>Heavy rhythmic footsteps.
>There are a few others there though too, lighter more dainty footfalls.
>You hear the thudding sound before you hear the voices.
>" -ear to GOD Carrie, you can't pull me away from my work saying I need to see something without telling me what it is!" a high pitched female voice cuts through the thuds.
>The voice rings with confidence, like someone in charge and who has always BEEN in charge.
>"It's one of the prisoners Empress...Jeffrey has been torturing him and hadn't told you about him"
>Carrie's voice
>Usually it's so bold and flamboyant, even after seeing you ripped to shreds; she was usually just as chipper.
>Now though, she sounded worried and reserved, maybe even a little fearful.
>"I don't need to know about every prisoner Carrie" the other voice.
>The footsteps get louder and louder as they walk closer.
>A surge of adrenaline, the desire to protect Star surges though you.
>You stand up casting aside the pain, and pull Star to her feet then push her behind you.
>Empress... The leader? Carrie had actually gotten to the leader like she said?
>As the footsteps get closer, you can now distinguish other besides the heavy thuds; Carries soft footsteps... and one even lighter than that.
>Barely even noticeable.
>Carrie comes into view first, and gives her usual cheerful smile to you.
>"Here you are Empress, you want to talk to this guy!" she said with her usual cheer, seemingly forgetting she's talking to the head of a crime group.
>The next thing you see is a giant hulk of a man, probably nearing 8 foot in height; his ragged shirt has the words "Mad Cunt" on it and his face...his face is just a metallic skull.
>Then from behind the man a small figure darts out and up to the energy barrier that separates you from them
>...an Opossum.
>You reach a hand behind you to make sure Star is still there, and sure enough she is.
>What is going on?
>Staring in disbelief at the opossum in front of you, there is no doubt.
>She's 5 foot tops, long purple hair and cybernetic eyes that make her entire eyeball violet, her tail replaced with a long winding metal one, not unlike Fox's but without any cosmetics to cover it.
>"Is this who I think it is Carrie?" the empress says, looking you up and down.
>Carrie nervously flits a bit with the syringe in her hair.
>"Empress, let me introduce Anon, the Ghost"
>The Empress looks from you to Carrie in disbelief, even the giant man looks surprised, which is impressive considering his lack of a face.
>You watch as the Empress balls up her little fist in anger.
>"They have had the GHOST down here and didn't bother to tell ME?!" She roars in anger.
>She looks at Gabriel, noting his arm and face.
>"AND THE UNDEAD? Raymond! Get me Jeffery NOW!" She snarls, looking up at the huge man.
>"Understood" the man says without opening his mouth before moving out of sight in a long strides.
>The Empress looks back to you, noting the grafts and missing leg.
>"Carrie...Why does he have a wooden leg?" she says to the nurse, not taking her eyes off the peg leg.
>At least...you think she's looking at it, her eyes don't have any pupils so it’s hard to judge where she’s looking.
>"Oh Uh! When they brought him he was missing a leg! So I figured, tables have legs too; so I gave him a table leg!" the fox nurse says with a cheery smile.
>The empress face paws and sighs then looks up at your face.
>"Ah... uh where are my manners, I am the Empress, leader of the holy Emperors" She says with a short bow at you.
>You reciprocate the bow, painfully.
>"I'm Anon, nice to meet you...Juno".
>The Empress freezes, then looks at you with surprise and malice.
>"How do you know that name?" she demands, her voice cold as ice.
>You feel Star shrink back behind you upon hearing it.
>You stay calm though; while she had the voice, she still had nothing on Lysander.
>"Jonathan Dismond" you say calmly with a smile "He told me yo-" 
>The loud thumping returns as you heard Raymond returning, dragging something - Someone, who weakly protests.
>"-n't do anything wro-"
>The words at cut short as Jeffery is thrown to the ground next to Juno; who regards him like someone would a piece of meat.
>Her eyes go from you to the Giraffe, then back to you.
>"Jeffery, why was I not told that you had the ghost here?" she says coldly, still looking at you questioningly.
>The giraffe scrambles to get into a low kneeling bow before the empress, yet still being bigger than her because of his size.
>"Madam, I knew he sought ingress to the underground through Lysander and the Concordate! I wanted to find out why before I presented him to you!" He hastily explains, not looking up at her.
>She regards that information with a swivel of one of her ears, then she frowns.
>"Why were you seeking to come down here Ghost? Did Dismond hire you to kill me?" she says in a low growl.
>You clear your throat and smile softly.
>"I was hired to find you bu-"
>"SEE MADAM! I WAS-" Jeffrey starts, but a hard kick from Raymond shuts him up, you're pretty sure you heard the crack of a rib as well.
>Juno nods at Raymond in approval.
>"Please continue" Juno says to you curtly.
>"As I was saying, I was hired to find you, not kill you; and not by Jonathan Dismond" you finish with a smile.
>"Then who prey tell, hired you Ghost?" Juno says, her eye narrowing to slits.
>You step to the side, revealing Star; who had been trying her hardest to hide under your shirt.
>Juno's mouth goes slightly agape and her eyes widen at the sight of Star, who is trying to hide behind you again.
>"Is...Is that" Juno says with a wavering voice "Is that my daughter?"
>At those words Star stops trying to get behind you and looks at Juno.
>The two stare at each other for a moment before Star utters a single word.
>"Mom?"
>Wordlessly, Juno lowers the force field between them and rushes in, catching Star in a Hug.
>"M-my Daughter! My little Star!" she sobs, holding Star close.
>You watch with a small smile and Gabriel leans on a wall, observing the scene.
>"So, this is what it’s like to do something besides kill people" he mutters to you softly.
>"I guess" you answer with a shrug.
>Juno pulls away from Star for a moment and looks her up and down.
>"Oh look how big you've gotten! And such pretty eyes" Juno says, her paws on Star's shoulders.
>Star’s ears fold a bit in embarrassment as Juno Looks her over.
>All that pain you went through might just be worth it to see this.
>Actually no it doesn't.
>You fake clear your throat to get Juno's attention.
>"So uh, what about us?" you say motioning "I've been down here a week getting tortured all because I was trying to reunite the two of you" 
>Juno ears flicked as she slowly turn from Star, to the still prostate form of Jeffrey
>"You TORTURED the man trying to get my daughter to me, kept him here without telling me and IMPRISONED. MY. DAUGHTER" Juno roared at Jeffrey, walking to him with slow purpose.
>If Jeffrey's face could pale, you're sure it would have.
>"I-I-I didn'-" he stutters, shaking like a leaf
>Juno's tail, which you thought a transceiver of sort, whips forward and stabs into the center of the giraffes back.
>Don't giraffes have less vertebra than a human? Does that make them more susceptible to spinal injury?
>That was a question you wouldn't know the answer to for now.
>"Shut it! Raymond take care of this trash for me!" She says, wrenching the tail out and looking up to the giant, who just nods and grabs the giraffe by the back of his long neck.
>In stoic silence, he drags off the protesting anthro.
>Juno then turns back to you and Star, then looks at Carrie with kind regards.
>"Carrie, get everyone you know who has any medical training, the Ghost needs medical attention" she says with angry vigor.
>As she says that you realize how much you're hurting and just how tired you are.
>Feeling like Star was in danger gave you extra vitality, the adrenaline that coursed through your veins stopped working as soon as you became conscious of it.
>You cough and slump down once more, only for Gabe to catch you and support you.
>"I got ya buddy" he whispers as blood trickles down your side from your over exertion.
>You're more than glad you made friends with this man, he's seen your worst, and your crazed looks after Cydonia, and the killing intent you had after.
>Juno eyes you with some admiration and some disgust at the sight of your blood.
>After all the rumors of the Ghost reached far and wide.
>Seeing you here, pained and bloody was not a good first impression.
>Usually the first people saw of you was a pure white mask, a black tear drop from one of the eyes, staring emotionless at them.
>It was a common scare-tactic used by Lysander.
>But Lysander wasn't here.
>Instead you had the mother of your girlfriend staring at you with high expectations.
>Better live up to it then.
>Star looks on at you as you use the last bit of strength you have to gather yourself up.
>Dignity was a hell of a drug.
>"Sorry Juno, I'm a bit out of sorts, lead on" you say with fake enthusiasm.
>Juno regards you calmly, you can tell she knows it’s an act, but says nothing about it, instead she smiles.
>"Sorry about that! Now then, let’s get out of this prison and catch up a bit shall we?" she says in a happy cheerful voice, in stark contrast to how she sounded just a moment before.
>Star grabs your hand and bounces happily next to you.
>You squeeze her paw softly and smile at her, earning tiny hearts in her eyes.
>Juno looks at you and Star with a bit of confusion.
>"Wait...You're...Together?"
>Star bounces happily, next to you, her prehensile tail, wrapping around your waist
>"Mhm! I thought he was dead though! Then we found him and you and I'm so happy!" she says quickly, making it hard to tell her words apart.
>Juno Looks you up and down with a raised eyebrow.
>"I can see why you thought he was dead, he certainly looks the part, but come! Let’s catch up in somewhere more luxurious" she says, turning from you and leading the way.
>You sigh and hold Star's paw, and Gabe gives you a bit of support to walk.
>How many crime syndicates are you friends with now?
>Also you realize they your girlfriend is the daughter of 2 crime syndicate bosses.
>Whatever.
>You're alive and you're with Star and Gabriel 
>So things couldn't be any better.

Chapter 11: Face to Face

>Quietly, you sit in an overly purple room that is filled with purple tapestries and china ware as Star happily explains to her mother how you met and what you do for her.
>You barely register is all as the IV in your arm pumps you full of whatever painkiller Nurse Carrie has set you up with.
>And holy shit does she have the good stuff.
>You can barely keep your eyes open as you look around in a daze.
>Gabe is on his phone, explaining everything to Fox, who is holding Hope.
>at one point earlier in their conversation he pointed it at you and you gave a hazy hello.
>She cried when she saw you, then cried more when she saw what happened with the burns and your leg.
>You do your best to reassure her you were ok.
>Hard to do when fucked up by whatever odd concoction Carrie had mixed up.
>Blinking hard, you try to push the visions of "not reality" away.
>It's difficult to say the least; the colors and sounds that formed a beautiful screenplay and you had to push them away to let you see reality.
>You suddenly have a profound understanding of the druggies you often hunted.
>Everything, every issue and sadness that plagued your life was gone; replaced by a haze of almost realness.
>Visions of you with augments fighting side by side with Gabe.
>Star with her collection of toys happy as ever.
>Hope growing up without augments and being accepted by society
>Fox and Gabe growing old together.
>Without you holding them back.
>Lysander allowing Gabe to retire and be a full time stay at home dad.                                              
>Almost all of your visions focus on everyone else and their happiness.
>But you fight them back to focus on reality; as shitty as it might be.
>Star has herself wrapped around your good arm, talking to her mother.
>"He goes out and gets me everything I want! He's the best and never fails!" She happily proclaims, her tail wrapped around your body like a fleshy bungee cord.
>It would hurt if you didn't have these drugs.
>Gabe is now talking to Lysander on his phone,her hologram showing a surprised expression as he explains; although you only catch the last bit of the conversation it seems.
>"-effery, your butler; was a double agent trying to stir up trouble to make himself look good, he ordered the attack on Null without the Empress's authorization"
>He looks to Juno for confirmation, raising an eyebrow.
>Juno looks away from Star to face the hologram of Lysander; her pupil-less eyes "focused" on the hologram.
>"Your...operative for lack of a better word, wanted to dispose of the ghost...for an unknown reason, I was unaware he worked for you" she says calmly, holding a paw up to shush Star.
>Lysander  ponders this for a moment, looking at the scene.
>You; half scarred and probably looking more like a zombie or a junkie than anything else.
>Gabe; looking tired and shabby, in front of a table that looks like it should be from a doll house set.
>Star wrapped around you like a vine.
>and Juno, a rival crime boss, serving you tea.
>Lysander's response is calm and very calculated, as always.
>"Anon is...and shall be a useful tool for me and my partners; if you harbor no ill will against him, nor my...interests, then we can co-exists" the sabre toothed feline states calmly, he eyes focused on you as she speaks.
>"However, should you encroach on my terr-"
>Juno raises a paw and holds it up to shush Lysander in the most respectful and motherly way possible.
>"I understand, however we should talk later to set boundaries." she states calmly, while looking at you.
>Why do you feel that was directed at you?
>"We will speak later then" Lysander says calmly before her hologram focuses on you.
>"Anon, if she tries to double cross us, eliminate her" the hologram states matter of factly.
>Ouch.
>Talk about conflicted interests.
>kill your boss or kill your girlfriends mom.
>NOPE.
>Sidestep that whole thing.
>"Lysander, i respectfully decline; i cannot serve you in that regard due to conflict of interest, however i will still follow your commands" You say in your brief moment of clarity.
>Lysander, Juno and Gabe all look a bit shocked at your response, presumably due to your drugged haze.
>Only Star doesn't seem to realize what's going on.
>Lysanders calm cool eyes wander from you, to Star, then to Juno.
>A cold grin that chills you to the bone crosses her muzzle.
>"Ah...I see, i will be in contact with you later Anon" She says finally before her hologram disappears.
>Why do you have a bad feeling about that.
>You rub your face and feel the haze set back in.
>Lysander has been a good employer and a good source of income ever since you became one of her lackeys.
>If she wasn't paying you, you would probably be hunting her; and she knows it.
>You've seen the counter measures against you on the concordate's property.
>They think they are safe from you, but they showed you everything.
>Every camera, every ultraviolet camera, and every thermal camera.
>Yes, you were loyal to Lysander, but only because she paid you.
>If you wanted, or were offered a better deal, you could get in there and take her down.
>But there is no reason to think that way; you were being paid handsomely for your work for her and you know IF someone even tired to hire you against her she could easily pay more.
>were the drugs making you think like this? 
>Nurse Carrie frets casually with your bandages, checking them periodically as the IV Drips in your arm.
>She's been such a great nurse to you.
>"Juno" you say woozily,one of your eyes struggling to stay open.
>"hm?" The tiny opossum hums questioningly.
>"Despite my... Treatment... Nurse Carrie has been the best caregiver she could be given the circumstances" you rasp out, feeling tired and wanting nothing more than to sleep.
>She nods at that and reaches past Star to put a paw on your bandaged hand.
>"I am truly sorry for the treatment you received, and I thank you for all you have done for my daughter" she responds in a caring motherly voice.
>You smile half heartedly and feel the drugs begin to kick in once more.
>"I'll always be there for her" you say weakly, pulling your arm out of Star's grasp and pulling her gently against your good side.
>Star leans against you, her blue eyes forming little glowing hearts as she looks up at you.
>"Love you Anon" she squees happily, pulling your good arm around her.
>You smile weakly and do your best to pull her closer.
>"Love you too Star" you respond looking into those beautiful cybernetic eyes.
>"Awwww"
>You look up to see Juno with her paws on her cheeks, swooning at the sight of you.
>"My baby found such a good man! How lucky for the both of you!" she says , rocking side to side in happiness.
>"Hey now, Null has a body count that would make most people think twice about calling him a good man" Gabe interjects, earning him and angry gaze from you.
>He shrugs when he sees your glare.
>"What?" he asks calmly "You do"
>Much to your annoyance, He does have a point.
>You've buried more people than you can even recall.
>Honestly, you stopped counting after 40.
>Blurrily you look at Juno, preparing to defend yourself; only to see her shrug.
>"A body count does not make someone a bad person" she states calmly before sipping her tea.
>Normal wisdom would say otherwise, but you aren't going to argue it.
>Gabe seems somewhat shock at her response and looked ready to get a rebuttal, only for you to give a light kick under the table.
>"Shut it" you silently mouth to him, only for him to shrug and point to Rose.
>Your gun lays on the table, half charred and burned, the other half clean and unscathed.
>Juno, being the mob boss that she is, simply smiles at your interaction.
