>One beautiful sun-shiny day you, the mayor of [Insert Town Name Here], were taking a nice stroll outside
>pulling weeds from the ground and watering the roses and daisies
>Everyone was smiling and being generally happy
>except for one villager
>the only sheep in the town, Baabara
>She was sitting on the cliff edge that over looks the sea
>The sheep was upset about something
>You don't like it when one of your people(?) are upset
>You sit next to your woolly friend and ask her what's wrong
>"Oh *sniffle*, Hello Mayor. It's nothing you should be worried about, It's just a me thing." 
>You call nonsense and state that you are more than willing to her out her problem(s)
>"Well it's just that no one really wants to hangout with me. I mean like I'm a great sheep to talk to but NO everyone else has 'better' things to do than to hangout with the ONLY SHEEP IN THE ENTIRE TOWN! And blablablablablabla etc. etc. etc."
>'Oh dear' you though. this was going to much harder than you anticipated

>Soon Baabara stops her rant that you were totally listening to
>"I just don't know what to do Mayor. It feels like everyone and hates me and I hate that."
>Ah but you have have a plan
>well, a cat you know """might''' have a plan

>You go to the only cat in town whose good with the ladies
>Punchy
>It was hard to find him at first
>you thought that he'd be home but really he was out on a nature walk
>You find the black and white cat sitting on a stump
>sleeping
>you wake the cat up in the most humane way possible
>by making a hellish screech that would shatter glass right next to Punchy's ear
>He slowly wakes up, not fazed by the hell screech you did
>"Oh waddup mayor, what do you need on this beautiful afternoon
>you explain to him your, well, Baabara's problem
>"Yes, yes indeed, this is quite the dilemma. Bring me your sheep friend and I will try my best."
>Punchy is the greatest

>it's been about 2 hours since Baabara and Punchy started their session
>And though out all of that you can hear stuff breaking and yelling
>soon Baabara storms out of Punchy's house, going right past you
>Punchy approaches you
>Good Lord he's covered in injuries
>"Well I'd say that went pretty well, though she might need some more work. Have her come by tomorrow will ya?"
>and of course he isn't fazed by any of those wounds at all
>you even think is arm is broken
>You politely dismiss your feline friend's offer
>"Alright then, if you need me I have stuff to do, maybe."
>Punchy goes back into his house
>you can hear blood curdling screams seconds after
>you find Baabara sitting at the same place
>you apologize to Baabara for what just happened
>"thank you Mayor but next time find someone who doesn't make insults at you every time when they're high."

>You ask your sheep friend if there was anyway to make it up to her
>"well, I do want to go to that new in the city but I don't have anyone to go with. Maybe you can go with me mayor."
>Oh
>oh no
>not clubs
>your not a social person
>especially round city folk
>you'll drop your spaghetti within seconds
>and if you're with a girl it'll be worse
>but you can't just let your friend down, not after what happened just now
>you accept her invitation
>Baabara squeals (baas?) in delight
>"Oh thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou Mayor! You don't know how happy you just made me!"
>well
>she's smiling, so that's a plus
>Baabara gets up and starts skipping back to her place
>oh shit wait.
>did she say when she wanted to go to the club?
>fuck it you'll call her later and ask
>you head back to your home/castle/estate since it's getting late
>when you get inside you get a call
>from punchy
>you answer the call
>"heya mayor, I just wanted to let you know you owe me... 700,000 bells for damages"
>Fuck
>to the island you go

>after slaving away for the majority of the night trying to catch gold beetles to pay off Punchy's hospital bill you final return home
>there's a few messages on your machine
>one from Mom
>couple of messages from HHA
>one from that smash tournament thing
>and one from Baabara

>"IT'S UNLOCKED!"
>well ok
>the Mayor opens the door and steps in
>He sees Baabara covering herself with a towel
>"Oh Mayor, your here! Can you help me dry off? it'll take forever if I do it.
>what
>"It already took 2 hours to wash all this wool. maybe I should shear off this wool again."
>2 hours to take a shower?
>The Mayor hurries on helping his date dry off 
>"here, take this blow dryer and start working on my back."
>She hands the mayor a high powered-possibly an industrial-blow dryer.
>with the two of them working together it only took 30 minutes to dry Baabara off
>and yes, The Mayor did in fact get to see large, soft sheep tiddies
>It took Baabara 25 minutes to dress herself
>mostly because she needed help getting into her dress that seemed like it was about to burst when she got it on
>"yeah I'm definitely going to shear myself soon." 
>she doesn't wear make-up, she says it stains her wool
>Soon both of them are ready to go
>The mayor hands her the roses he got
>"Roses, nice. uh, thank you."
>She doesn't sound too happy to get them
>"I like tulips a lot more than roses Mayor, but I do appreciate the thought.
>The Sheep-human couple board the train to the city
>they of course sit next to each other
>Some of the other animal passengers gave the couple looks, mostly because it was weird for the Mayor to be with someone who wasn't a rabbit or cat
>the two ignored the gawking and waited for destination

>it's an absolute nightmare
>Baabara is somewhere crying her eyes out
>an eagle is on the ground in a bloody pulp

>The Mayor stops and tells her it was the least he could do after what happened with best cat

>The to were enjoying themselves for a time
>Having some fun dancing and what not
