>win a ticket to that new female anthros fighting ring 
>one got made some time ago and you never bothered to go 
>always heard it was pretty lewd with anthro woman fighting naked or in fetish looking outfits 
>figure it might be fun and you got free entrance 
>go to the place when it opens for the night 
>the bouncer/entrance guard is some huge anthro guy and he takes your ticket
>stops you and sniffs at you then asks if you're single or with someone 
>you tell him single and he hands you a red arm band and tells you to sit in the red seating area 
>that was odd to say the least and you guess it's some anthro thing since this whole thing is an anthros only fighting ring 
>walk in and see others with blue arm bands about and getting to their seats 
>you keep walking looking for the red seating area and see it's right up front row near the ring
>and it's lower in the ground with some fencing around it separating it from the blue/general seating areas 
>sweet, maybe this was a perk for winning that ticket 
>look around and notice everyone in the red seating area is a guy, human or anthro
>spotlights flood the ring and a mongoose girl in a rather fetishistic looking outfit walks out with a mic 
>starts hyping the crowd up and explaining the rules for newcomers
>announces the first 2 fighters 
>one is an all white arctic wolf naked except some blue swirl patterns painted all over her body 
>she's also massive and imposing
>she's showing off in the ring with poses to show her muscles and curves before letting out the loudest howl you ever heard and many of the dog/wolf audience joined in with her and some humans even tried to howl too
>guess she's got a lot of fans
>her opponent walks into the ring next 
>she's a jaguar in very aztec looking get up, but still mostly naked
>all sorts of colorful feathers hang off strings or bands
>looks like she wants to one up the wolf since she calls a human guy in the red area up to the ring

>he nervously gets in the ring and holy shit does it show how big these woman are 
>she pulls a bucket from out of the ring and has the guy dip his hands in it
>when he pulls them out they're red and wet with paint 
>she turns and bends slightly forward with her ass pointing at the guy 
>telling him to do something 
>he hesitates for a bit before he places his hands on her big ass firmly
>the crowd cheers at this and after some time she moves away and she faces him again 
>from this angle you can see two bright red human hand prints on her ass
>she then grabs his crotch forcing him on his tip toes before she whispers something in his ear and licks the side of his face 
>she makes a line on his forehead withe the red paint before letting him go back to his seat 
>that "are you singe" question you got at the door is starting to make more sense now and you think how you'll be returning to this place again
>wonder if they have any membership thing?
>the announcer comes on telling the 2 to get to their corners 
>looks like the first round is starting 
>you can feel a rather large change in the atmosphere of the crowd and ring 
>everything goes quiet before a bell rings and the 2 charge each other 
>and your entire view of this place changes when they start tearing into each other 
>fangs and claws flash and sink into each other 
>they're not holding back and blood is being drawn 
>nothing life threatening since both are still going at just as viciously
>you also notice there's no ref at all and some, what you assume are, medics down by a back stage entrance
>the fight goes on for little longer before both are panting 
>the jaguar gets an upper hand and gets the wolf in a choke hold 
>the wolf eventually goes limp a bit before the jaguar drops her and the wolf starts taking deep coughing breaths 
>the crowd erupts into cheers while the medics wordlessly get into the ring cheeking on the wolf

>she needed a bit of help standing up, but limps out of the ring and back stage on her own 
>the jaguar meanwhile hops out of the ring and walks towards the human guy she marked earlier and picks him up and tosses him over her shoulder 
>blood still dripping from some cuts
>she walks by and you get a full scale on how much bigger she is
>you also see the guy's face is a mixture of fear and excitement 
>the red hand prints also still clearly there on her ass and her walk has much sway to her hips
>she carries him to a different backstage entrance and you don't see either of them after that
>jesus, what have you gotten yourself into this time 
>you don't know if you're more terrified or excited for the next match 
>the next matches go the same way
>2 big anthro woman come up, some showboating is done, maybe they pick a guy before the match, they have a bloody fight until one can't fight anymore, the winner claims her prize, and there's another empty seat in the red area
>then it gets to the final match and you're slightly exhausted from all the tension and excitement of tonight 
>and holy shit did they save up for the finale 
>2 fucking titans of woman walk into the ring 
>a Kodiak bear and grizzly bear woman are the last match 
>the grizzly is wearing some sort of lewd lumberjack get up
>a plaid shirt tied in that bikini fashion to hold her massive tits and jean shorts cut so small they're thongs
>the Kodiak looks more like a prehistoric monster
>naked with bands made of bone on her limbs and wearing a necklace with various skulls on it, including human skulls
>and ashen white streaks over various parts of her monstrous frame 
>then she looks over and locks eyes with you
>her gaze makes you freeze and forget to breath
>then your heart skips a beat when she makes a come hither gesture 
>on shaky feet you walk to the ring before you're pulled into the air at such speed and height you get momentary vertigo

>you're dangling in the air at head height to her and she looks you over with hungry eyes
>you must be hanging 9-10 feet in the air
>you also get an up close scale on just how colossal she is 
>all you get for a warning is a lewd smile and her eyelids lowering before she kisses you with fervor 
>given the size difference she covers most of your face 
>she lowers you out of the ring and places her necklace of skulls on your shoulders and you realize they're to scale 
>you also realize they are thankfully fake plastic skulls 
>the necklace makes it a bit awkward, but you manage to get back to your seat and she never took her eyes off you until the announcement to get ready to fight 
>when the bell rings both bears roar at each other first 
>it feels like every bone in your body is vibrating from that 
>then they crash into each other and start swiping
>god, you swear you can feel the impact of each massive hit from here 
>no wonder they didn't have either bear fight any other species, but their own with how much force each hit they throw 
>you clutch the skull necklace while watching every moment 
>it's like you have a front row seat to a godzila fight 
>there's actually very little blood with how thick each's hide is 
>the Kodiak gets a good grip on the grizzly and tosses her a few feet away before landing on her and throwing hits madly
>she gets one last punch in before the grizzly is out cold 
>she stands and lets out a victorious roar with the crowd cheering for the grand finale 
>everyone, but you that is
>you're deathly quiet with the realization of what comes next 
>she jumps out of the ring and her landing impact shaking you slightly 
>she's in front of you and slowly reaching for you
>next thing you know you're cradled in one of her arms pressed against her massive chest and surrounded by warm soft fur 
>she's only looking at you as she walks 
>and the only word she rumbles out 
>"Mine."
