>It's a hell of a thing, being sheriff
>Sheriff Anon of Comitates County
>a dusty little corner of the southwest with nothing going for it but a long stretch of road going from somewhere better to somewhere better
>but as duly elected sheriff, you'd protect it all the same
>usually you didn't get trouble, the sole town of Carrington too small to have any real crime beyond personal disputes, and most of the homesteads being too far apart to cause trouble
>even the carriages, coaches, and travelers passing through hardly met with any complications
>until recently that is
>thirteen carriages robbed, all the passengers left in their drawers and hogtied for your deputies to find and recover
>carriage drivers telling stories of an outlaw that shrugged of shots from revolver and coach gun like they were made of steel
>one such was in your office now, the nervous, sallow-faced rat slamming his fist on your scuffed desk
>"This is--This is the third time my passengers have been robbed crossing your county, sheriff!"
>he jabbed a finger out the window
>"That bandit is out there laughing at you AND the law! Don't that mean nothing to you?"
>you regard him casually from your reclined position, chair tipped back and legs resting on the desktop
"And you say this bandit was...bulletproof?"
>the rat bobs his head quickly
>"Bulletproof! I know I hit 'em last time, saw the bastard stagger, but then he just stood back up like it was nothing!"
>you sigh and kick up, pitching forward with the chair to stand up in one smooth motion
"Alright. I'll deal with it."
>you gathered your deputies, a scrawny human a few years your junior and just barely into manhood, and an old workhorse anthro
>Hughes and Elliot respectively
>along with the newly deputized stage coach driver whose name you didn't bother to remember
>you had a plan, hardly the most elegant, but it should do to bushwack a single bandit out in the countryside
>you and your deputies would take a ride in the rat's carriage, armed to the teeth, and when the bandit showed his face, the three of you would jump out and finish the matter one way or the other
>all the driver had to do was drive along until the bandit showed face, and then duck his head when the shooting started
>still he jittered with nerves while he snapped the reigns to set off down the dirt road out into the plain
>"Just stick to the plan."
>Elliot reminds the driver through the window of the coach
>"No way one bandit can beat all three of us. Then there'll be no trouble at all."
>Hughes grins wide as he loads rounds into the repeater he had lovingly named "Peterson"
>"Nickel says he surrenders the moment we get him in our sights! Whaddya think sheriff?"
>you grunt and watch out the window
"We'll see. Keep the guns out of sight until our bandit shows up."
>the ride is quiet, a couple hours passing into evening and the sun setting
>finally comes, however, just as you thought the bandit wouldn't show
>"Whoa!"
>you heard the driver as he yanked on the reigns to pull the carriage to a stop
>"All of you! Out of the carriage with your hands up!"
>that was a new voice muffled and hoarse, your bandit
>you had to admit, he'd picked a good spot to ambush you
>on one side of the carriage was a ditch a little too steep to climb out of easily
>and on the other, a rocky outcrop that was even more impossible to scale
>standing at the top was the bandit
>shorter than you expected, only coming up to your chest if you were to guess
>with their face concealed under a wide brim hat, and a mask around the muzzle
"I'm afraid..."
>you call out the door to the bandit as your draw your pistol and line up with the carriage door
"you're gonna have to put your hands up!"
>you boot open the door, jumping out and raising your weapon, while your deputies jump out the other side and fan out to take aim
>"Well!"
>the bandit laughs
>now that you can see him better, you can see he's bundled up as though it were winter
>a shirt, under a vest, under a coat, under a duster that was too large for the short, squat figure
>and a tail peaking out from the back of that duster
>"Finally got the sheriff out here, huh Floyd?"
>you glance over toward the carriage driver, who cringes
>"I'm sorry!"
>he wails the apology as he leaps down from the seat and flees
>you return your attention to the bandit, leveling your weapon
"By my authority as sheriff of Comitates county, I am placing you under arrest, sir!"
>Hughes pipes up
>"So drop your guns and come quietly!"
>the bandit scoffs, ignoring your deputy
>"I only wanted you, sheriff! A little time with my favorite lawman! Tell your dogs to go home and we'll settle this, nice and easy."
>you about to respond when the bandit opens fire, putting a round in the dirt between your feet
>you and your deputies spring into action, opening fire on the bandit with alacrity
>diving and hopping, the stranger descends down the rock face at a startling pace
>bullets bounce off the rocks around the bandit, though you seem the puff of impact on his sides as both your deputies score separate shots
>but it seems the rumors were true, and this outlaw really was bulletproof, as the shots only served to stagger, not kill
>"Ha!"
>with a final leap, you're face to face with your attacker
>right in front of you, last round in your pistol
>you reflexively fire, not stopping to thing about aiming
>you're left staring at a round hole in the bandit's hat, before your view is drawn to the barrel of his own pistol leveled right at your eye
>"Hold it!"
>something's not right
>now that you're close, you realize this bandit's voice doesn't quite match the harsh shouts from atop the rocks
>"Lower your pistol, sheriff. Deputies too!"
>with a start, you realize that this was a woman with a revolver leveled at your forehead
>guess it doesn't make a difference now
>you slowly lower your weapon, though out of the corner of your eye, you see Elliot with his own hand-cannon still raised
>"Tell him to drop it, sheriff, or I'll start getting nervous."
>the bandit twitches the revolver in her hand to emphasize her point
"Drop it, Elliot."
>he scowls, and slowly sets the weapon on the ground
>"Sorry, Anon."
>the outlaw grabs the front of your shirt, and forcefully spins you about
>she's stronger than her size would make you think
>"March."
>she prods you with the gun and forces you forward down the road
>"Me and the sheriff are going for a little walk! If either of you two try and follow me, I'll put a couple holes in his back!"
>you crane your head to see the carriage and your deputies receding
"If you're gonna shoot me, shoot me. I don't have anything worth taking, and no one will pay a ransom."
>your tough talk earns you another jab from the gun barrel
>"Oh you got something I want, sheriff. I aim to take it once we get back to my little hideout."
>she laughs, a devious snicker that unnerved you despite your attempt to keep a tough faÃ§ade
>she marches you a good while, long enough for the sun to fully set
>by the time she calls a stop, you're panting and sweating, and your throat burns for a drink of water
>"Aw, what's the matter sheriff? Getting tired? It's okay, we're just about there. See?"
>she turns you to the side, and points out a dilapidated looking ranch house in the distance
>"Home sweet home!"
>for some reason, the old building looked familiar
>it's only a short hike to the house, and once she's forced you inside, the bandit swings the door shut behind her
>"Whew, good to be home, huh Anon?"
>your eyes adjust to the darkness inside the dilapidated ranch, and you finally get a look at the face of your assailant when she pulls her hat and mask off
"Buh!"
>your jaw hangs open and you stare in amazement at her
>a pangolin!
>not just a pangolin, but a pangolin you knew!
"Candy?!"
>your old childhood friend grins sweetly
>"Glad to see you still recognize me, Anon! The years could have been kinder to me."
>you doubt that statement as she sheds the clothes that you now know were to conceal her gender, revealing a well-rounded figure beneath
>you're too amazed to formulate a response
>what the hell is going on?
>"You'll catch flies if you don't pick your jaw up, sheriff."
>Candy giggles and holsters her pistol with a theatrical twirl
>"Honestly, I thought you had me with that last shot. You may have chipped one of my plates..."
>she chats idly, as though you two had never parted, and as though just a short while ago you weren't trying to kill each other
"Candy!"
>you manage to break the stupor and silence her chatter
"Candy what the hell are you doing? You--You're an outlaw? You rob people?"
>Candy nods enthusiastically
>"I sure am! Toughest gun in the west!"
>she raps a claw against one of her plates
>"After my pa's ranch dried up, I didn't have nothing else, and a girl's gotta eat, so..."
>she trails off into a shrug, as though she had merely forgotten to do some chores, not taken up a life of banditry
>"Oh! Where are my manners, you must be dying of thirst..."
>she sniffs
>"And sweating like a hog."
>there's that unnerving giggle again as she trots off deeper into the house
>when she returns, it's with a canteen in hand, as well as a couple sticks of jerky
>you take the water wordlessly, and drink deep
>"Easy cowboy! Leave some for me."
>Candy snatches the canteen from you and takes a swig of her own
>"There! Feeling refreshed?"
>you give a slight nod
>"Good!"
>she grabs your wrist and tugs you down the hall into one of the bedrooms
>"You don't know how long I've waited to see you again Anon. When I heard you became sheriff, I knew just how to find you without getting arrested! And now I have you all to myself."
>she deposits herself on the bed
>her eyes are shining in the moonlight that filters through the bedside window
>"I can finally say 'I love you Anon'. Ha! There, I said it, isn't it wonderful? I love you. I always loved you, since way back when we were kids."
>you stare at her, not sure how to react
>you knew what you had to do, of course
>"You don't have to say it back right away, Anon. This must be a shock to your system. Hehe, remember those nights we used to sneak out to watch the stars together? Secret and alone together..."
"Candy..."
>"Yes Anon?"
>you take a deep breath to steel yourself
"Candy, we can't stay here. We have to--You have to come back to town. You're wanted. I can take you back, tell the judge you surrendered to me--"
>she laughs, a harsh edge to it that betrays a flare of anger
>"Oh Anon, so tough! So duty-bound. No time for love. No time to notice poor Candy pining over you all those years. It's okay Anon! I know you felt it too, I know you were just scared."
>she stands up from the bed and approaches you
>"Please, Anon, none of that stuff matters. Don't you want this? Don't you want...me?"
>she traces a hand up your chest, then to your chin to gently pull you down into a passionate kiss
>her eyes flutter, still shining even though she's stepped away from the window
"I'm sorry, Candy..."
>you push her away gently
"I can't. I have a duty. I'm the sheriff now."
>Candy frowns, her lip trembling as tears start to well up
>"I was scared you would say that."
>click
>she draws her revolver and pulls back the hammer in one smooth motion
>"Take your pants off. Now."
>this is ridiculous
"This is ridiculous. I'm not having sex with you just because you have a gun. You're not going to sh--"
>Candy fires the pistol
>it whizzes by your head, so close you swear it could have shaved a streak in your hair
>so loud your ears ring and your head swims
>Candy's next words are muffled by the after-effects of the blast
>"Pants. Off."
>she cocks the hammer again, and the steel in her eye says she won't miss the next shot
"Okay! Okay. They're coming off. Please reconsider, Candy. It isn't right."
>"I don't care. I want this, Anon. And nowadays I take what I want."
>she motions with the weapon, and you move to comply, pulling down your trousers and undoing your breeches
>it's Candy's turn to stare as she leers at your manhood with undisguised lust
>you're just working up the nerve to go for the gun when she refocuses and turns the gun toward the bed
>"Sit down, Anon. And take off your shirt too."
>you do as you're told, not even bothering to unbutton your shirt, simply yanking it over your head and tossing it aside
>"Why did you have to make this so hard, Anon? Isn't it easier to just give in? I know some part of you wants this."
>she keeps the gun trained on you as she approaches the bed
>you expect her to stop in front of you, but she steps around to climb up on the bed behind you
>"Sit back for me, Anon."
>her breath tickles your ear
>Candy's hand is at your shoulder, gently pulling to back against her body
>you feel her breasts pressing into your back, her legs spread so you can sit between them
>"I love feeling your skin, Anon..."
>the hand goes from your shoulder to your chest, hard claws making you shiver as they trace lines over bare skin
>"So soft, so smooth. Nothing like my plates, hard enough to stop bullets. But I have soft parts too..."
>Candy spends a few minutes, idly exploring your body with her free hand, breathing softly in your ear
>you have to remind yourself to stay focused, not to relax
>your breath hitches as she drifts down toward your lap
>"Don't be scared."
>she shushes you and drags a claw down your member
>you shudder as it twitches at her attention
"Candy, please..."
>you start to squirm, trying to escape her embrace, but she grabs you with her other hand
>she must have dropped the pistol
>"It's okay Anon! It's okay, I promise. I won't hurt you. I could never hurt you. Just let me have this..."
>she takes your in her paw now, slowly stroking your shaft to half mast
>she's careful, using only the soft pads on her paws
>"Let me have you, and I'll be done. No more robberies. No more gunfighting."
>you grit your teeth
>you want to give in to it, in spite of your resolve to follow the law and do your duty
>Candy was as beautiful as when you had seen her last
>you missed her
>and maybe you even loved her before you two had parted
"I can't Candy..."
>"You can, Anon! Just tonight. Just while you're here with me."
>all the while she continues stroking, a constant rising pressure in your loins that works away at your will
>finally you fold back against Candy fully, voice shuddering as you moan out her name
"Candy..."
>her hand stops, and her breath catches
>"Anon?"
>you turn your head, just enough to meet her snout, and kiss her
>it's sloppy, and desperate
>but she returns it eagerly, starting to stroke you again
>her tongue, longue and slender, presses against your lips and slips into your mouth
>it curls around your tongue, and you have to stop yourself from choking from the strange sensation of it
>Candy pulls back from the kiss
>"Are you okay?"
>you cough and nod your head, not trusting to speak without your voice quavering
>Candy returns the nod, and starts to kiss you again, this time peppering from your lips down your neck and shoulder
>"I want to do something, Anon. Please trust me..."
>you nod again, and with that motion she withdraws, letting go of you to slide back on the bed
>you bite down on the whimper that almost escaped you
>"Lay back on the bed for me, Anon. Give me your hands."
>you do as she asks, and once you're laying fully on the bed, she takes your hands and holds them together under your head
>you look up to see her leaning over the edge of the bed, tail swaying for balance as she attempts to maintain her hold on your hands while rummaging for something beneath the bed
>she comes back with a length of rope
>your eyes go wide at the sight of that, and you start to tug at her grip on your wrists
>"Trust me, Anon. Trust me."
>she pleads
>"It's just for me. I'll untie you if you can't handle it, but just try for me."
>this is the wrong choice
"Okay."
>Candy smiles and binds your hands together, then ties them to a metal rung of the headboard
>"Now I have you, all to myself, Anon."
>your heart sinks as she starts unbuttoning her own shirt
>she must have caught your expression
>"Just until I'm done."
>she tosses aside her shirt and finally see her bare torso
>from her neck down, instead of hard plates is soft, nearly hairless skin, a lighter shade of brown than her plates
>your gaze lingers on her breasts, her dark nipples standing out against her paler skin
>she cups them with a teasing smile
>"I think you're starting to enjoy yourself, Anon~"
>Candy moves around to your front, easily sliding your legs apart and laying down
>she presses her snout into your sack, inhaling through her nostrils
>the sensation is strange, but not unpleasant, and she seems to really enjoy it
>her breath hitches and shudders every time she exhales
>"I could do this all night, Anon. But you want more, don't you?"
>you pick your head up enough to meet her beautiful brown eyes
>her mouth hovers just over the head of your prick
>you groan out a soft 'yes'
>Candy snickers, and then takes you into her mouth
>at the same time, she curls that peculiar tongue of hers around your shaft, using it to stroke as she bobs her head
"Oh fuck..."
>she takes her time, slowly working her way down with each bob of her head
>she's tantalizingly slow, and it drives you wild
>the feeling of her tongue wrapped around your cock as she sucks greedily is like nothing you've experienced before
>your member twitches and leaks pre-cum into her mouth, which her dexterous tongue laps up easily
>when it feels like you can't take it anymore and you're going to burst, Candy pulls back with a soft gasp
>her tongue leaves you a second after her lips do
>she catches her breath, huffing your scent even more as she does so
>you groan and buck your hips as you're left without stimulation
>the ropes dig into your wrists when you tug against them
"Candy please, I was close. So close!"
>she pushes off the bed to her knees
>"Aw, now you're so eager. Don't worry Anon. I'll take care of you."
>she digs a claw into her pants, and in a motion, tears them down to the knees
>the shredded remains of her pants drop free, revealing she wore nothing underneath
>and she's so aroused the she's dripping
>a a distant part of your brain wonders if she had planned that move
>the rest of you is totally entranced, watching while Candy crawls over you, kicking out of the last shreds of her trousers as she deposits herself on your lap
>with her chin resting on your chest, she stares up into your eyes
>"You're all mine, aren't you Anon?"
>she grinds against you as she awaits your answer
>"And if you're all mine, then I can be all yours."
>you manage to speak around desperate moans
"Yes! Yes Candy I'm yours. I--I love you. After all this time I still love you."
>"You don't know how long I waited to hear you say that Anon."
>Candy leans back, sitting up cowgirl style on your lap, still grinding against your shaft
>she reaches behind to take it gently, careful of her claws as she positions herself to drop down on your cock
>"Ready Anon?"
>she doesn't wait for an answer before she starts to slowly lower herself to take you
>your head falls back and you think you can see stars
>once she's taken you all the way to the hilt, Candy drags a claw down your stomach, just hard enough to refocus you
>"Don't look away. I want to see your face."
>you don't dare to disobey now
>her eyes are shining again when you lock your eyes with them
>"I love you too, Anon."
>she draws herself up, and then drops her hips down again, then grinds with your member inside her
>she continues this methodical pace, though she picks up speed as she goes on
>she starts to moan and huff with every thrust, and you pump with all the leverage you can manage to meet her
>she suddenly slams herself down as deep as she can, and grinds hard
>repeating this motion several times, her moans rise in pitch and volume
>on the final thrust, she gasps and falls forward, supporting herself on your chest as her whole body shivers
>she quivers and contracts around you, crying out sharply as her climax rolls over her
>her tail even wraps around your leg to squeeze tightly
>she takes a bit to regain her composure
>finally she lowers herself onto your chest to relax and sighs contentedly
>"That was everything I dreamed it would be, Anon."
>you grunt in response
>Candy is happy, but you still haven't reached your own orgasm
>you are so horny
>"What's the matter, Anon? You look like you're about to burst."
>Candy snickers, though it's cut up my short huffs for breath
>"Don't worry. I'll take care of you Anon. My Anon~"
>she rises off of you, leaving your painfully hard member still slick with her femcum
>you groan and tug at your bonds, desperate to keep Candy close to you
>she simply tuts as she stands over you between your legs
>then she leans down, and grabs both of your ankles
"Candy? What are you--whoa!"
>she quickly hauls your legs up, and some of your body with them, so you're left pressed against your upper back and shoulders with your legs and waist hoisted straight up
>Candy then steps forward and presses your legs down so they're almost touching your shoulders
"Oh god..."
>if you had felt vulnerable before when you were simply bound and rode, now you were completely at her mercy, with no way to gain leverage
>"Just relax and let me take care of you."
>you don't have much a choice
>Candy holds your legs and lines herself up once again
>"Make sure to finish deep inside. I want pups."
>pups?!
>she drops her hips, this time quick and rough
>rather than the slow grind that she started with at first, she jumps straight to a rapid pace
>"Don't you want pups Anon? Give me a whole litter!"
>she continues to demand you breed her all while she fucks you harder and harder, faster and faster
>you think the bed is going to break
"Nngh! Candy I'm--Fuck me!"
>you can't get enough words out to warn Candy how close you are to giving her exactly what she wants
>she leans in closer
>"Do it. Cum inside me, my Anon."
>it's too late now for you to stop following her demands
>you explode inside her, howling in pleasure
>Candy presses down against you, forcing you balls deep to ensure she gets every last pump of your seed
>"Yes~ My Anon, I love you so much. I'll never leave your side again. Stay with me forever, please."
>you can't get your mind to focus enough to formulate a response, as you still shudder and moan through the last of the your orgasm
>your own spunk runs down your shaft when she finally pulls out again
>she releases your legs, letting you fall limp on the bed
>Candy drops down on top of you, nuzzling into the crook of your shoulder
>the sudden pain of her stony plates dragging across your skin shocks you out of your afterglow
"Ow!"
>"Whoops! Sorry! Sorry Anon, just wanted to get closer. Here!"
>Candy reaches up past your head and with a flick of her claw, you're free of the ropes that had tied you to the bed
>she takes your shoulder and turns you onto your side facing away from her
>then her arms slide under yours and pull you back against her
>"Better?"
>you're much more comfortable now, and even if you weren't you don't think you have the energy to complain
"Better. Love you Candy."
>"I love you too, Anon. My Anon..."


>The sheriff and the bandit weren't heard from in the county of Comitates again.
>a funeral was held for the lost lawman, with only his deputies there to mourn
>the carriages and travelers stopped getting robbed on the long road from somewhere better than Carrington to somewhere better than Carrington
>and somewhere very, very far away from Carrington and Comitates county, Mr. and Mrs. Nimous, a human and his pangolin wife, settled on a small ranch and raised a family of more than a dozen pups.
