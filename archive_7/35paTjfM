The Sheriff is now starting to get mad.

">N-NO! it's just the DNA!,it-it just makes it harder to look for human and anthro hair follicles so we like to just narrow down to humans."
>"Please, I'm not trying to offend I'm just trying to do my job sir."
Hopefully that will calm the situation Anon hoped.

The Sheriff exhales with embarrassment and to release his pressure valve of stress.
>"Fine... sorry for the outburst...just don't get many of you smooth-er I mean humans around Redwood is all, when they do it's usually for these kinds of cases, makes me feel like I'm stupid or something, like I can't solve them on my own."

Anon softly nods his head. "> I understand how you must feel, but rest assured I am not here to insult your fine work of protecting the citizens of Redwood, I hope we can become an effective team sheriff."
That smooth remark must be a slur towards humans but he wasn't doing it on purpose just old habits Anon presumed.
>"Let's start over shall we...  name's Joe"
Joe puts his paw out for a handshake.
>"Anon; special agent anon, but you can call me anon"
Anon says smiling at Joe while shaking his paw
>"Well... Anon, I better take you to the coroner's office then" Joe says breaking into a soft reciprocating smile. Special agent Anon doesn't feel to worried about working in Redwood Pines anymore.
