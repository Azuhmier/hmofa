>you are awoken from a pleasant dream by a wet tongue licking all over your face
>it doesn't take much in the way of investigation to figure out who it belongs to
"Down girl, down, I'm awake"
>coco leans back to straddle your waist while panting and wagging her tail
>kinda reminds you of that dream you just had
"Morning master, now come on hurry up and get ready, you gotta come see your present"
>coco get off you heads to the doorway as sit there confused for a few seconds
"Wait present? Whats the occasion?"
>coco stops in the doorway and looks back at you
"Well I'm not going to be outdone by a cat"
>with that she goes through the door
>but her clarification only confuses you further
>bailey got you a gift?
>well you suppose she'd give it to you when you got up as well
>either way it's about time to get dressed
>you go over to your dresser and pick out you clothes for the day
>when you turn around to lay them on your bed you're horrified by what you see
>on the pillow opposite of the side you slept on lays a mangled dead bird
>you nearly retch at the sight and the knowledge that you slept right next to it for who knows how long
>but before you feel the need to rush for the disinfectant another more horrible realization comes over you
>if this is baileys present what could coco's present be?
>now your in a rush to put on your clothes
>you'll dispose of the carcass and clean your sheets later
>you need to make sure coco's present doesn't do any permanent damage to anything
>you nearly slip as you round the corner and shout
"BAILEY! COCO!"
>which as it turns out was totally unnecessary cause they're right there in front of you
>bailey is curled up on her recliner, currently blinking away sleep from her rude awakening 
>coco on the other hand has her back against a thumping cupboard door
>your heart sinks at the thought of what could be in there
>but first bailey needs a stern talking to and you muster the best angry tone you can
"Bailey, don't bring dead things into the house"
>her ears at first perk up but as she hears your tone they flatten against her head
"W-wait, but i-i..."
"No buts, I don't want to see any other dead animals here, I don't like'em and I don't want'em, got it?"
>bailey looks like she's going to say more but instead just nods her head and looks up at you with the saddest eyes she can muster
>but right now you're not having any of it
>you turn your attention to coco
>she has begun to cover the cupboard door as if to protect whats inside from you
>you give her a stern look before walking over and standing right in front of her
"Coco, whats in the cupboard?"
>she stammers out unintelligibly while looking around as if trying to find an escape route
>but she finds no way out of this situation and hangs her head low and lets out the most pathetic whine you've ever heard
>sighing, you kneel down and lift up her chin and begin to scratch it
"Don't worry coco, I'm not going to kick you out or anything, But you can't be bring living things into the house either"
>she seems to brighten up slightly at that but she doesn't ease up on protecting the cupboard
>in that small moment of silence is when you hear it
>you swear you hear whatevers in there crying for help
>now you're really curious
"Coco, what's in there?"
>she suddenly turns around and grabs a hold of the handle on the door
"Do you still want to see?"
>your about to tell her to just tell you but she immediately opens the door a crack and this is enough for whatever it is to escape
>all you see is a brown blur across the kitchen floor
>both your pets have far quicker reaction times than you do
>nearly running over each other both give chase to your "present"
>it's a short chase though
>bailey uses coco as a springboard to launch herself jaws first at the animal and catches it between them
>unfortunately she gives herself too much momentum as slams face first into the wall
>but she still holds onto her prize by the tail and you can finally get a good look at the poor creature
"OUCH OUCH OUCH TEETH HURTING I'M GOING TO DIE AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH!"
>in baileys jaws she holds what is very obviously a very panicked anthro rat girl
>she's surprising small for an anthro only between 2-3 feet tall and she doesn't really seem to be much different than how'd you expect an anthro rodent to be
>but in her mad thrashing she's not doing much to protect her modesty
>she has pretty well proportioned breasts for her size and she's got 6 pairs of them
>if you had to give her a cup size you'd say her top pair were the equivalent of a B cup for a normal sized women
>she also had a really puffy and prominent mound that would have been obvious even if she were trying to hide it
>but her most striking feature was her disproportionally wide hips and thighs
>they seemed far too large to fit on such a tiny girl and you imagined she had an ass to match
>but there was no way you ever going to sexualize a wild mouse girl even if your dick disagreed
"Coco where do you find her?"
>you struggled to imagine where she could of gotten it considering she wasn't allowed to go outside without your permission
"The garage"
>ah yes if it was anywhere in the house it would be there
>the one place you never had any reason to go into considering you couldn't actually open the door to get your car in
>now the only thing left to do was to figure out what to do with her
>you suppose the only right thing to do was to let her go considering you couldn't afford another pet
>you reach over to grab the poor girl by the scruff of her neck
>her struggles don't cease but all she can really do is weakly slap at your fingers
"Whoa now girl calm down, I'm not going to hurt you like these 2 meanies did" 
>your sweet words don't seem to calm her down but does put her into a more talkative mood
"What are you going to do to me? Break all my bone? Gut me? Boil me alive? Bite my head off? Do whatever you like I won't give you the satisfaction of hearing me scream!"
>you were going to point out that you already heard her scream plenty but decided it wasn't a good idea
"No i'm really serious about not hurting you, look"
>you brought her by the back door, opened it and put her down on her feet on the porch
"Oh freedom! thanks mis-OOOF"
>you still held onto her by the scruff of her neck tho
"Now listen here, I'm the one who owns that garage you've been squatting in" 
>the rat girl gives a nervous smile 
"Oh is that right hahahahah"
>her nervous laughter goes on for way too long
"I want to make this clear, I don't ever want to see your face around here again, and if one of my girls catches you in my garage ever again, then what happens, happens, got it?"
>the rat girl is really pulling on your hand in an attempt to escape
"Yeah got it hahahaha message received hahahaha you can let go now hahahaha"
>you do 
>you didn't think such a tiny thing could move so fast
>she jets off into the forest on the right side of your house
>then comes back across your backyard and jumps into the brush on the left side of your house
>you shrug your shoulders and close the door
>turning around to face your pets you give them both a stern look
>bailey has her tail curled around herself and coco has hers tucked between her legs
>you can't just let such a hectic morning go unpunished
>but how exactly do you go about punishing pets?
