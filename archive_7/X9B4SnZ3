Cuddling with Monsters  (Loka) 1.0
Jan 8th, 2020

Alright this was written Jan 22nd 2017. This was not my first pastebin story. But you can definately tell I was new to writing. I didn't even have a name, I just ended the greentext with -QT. This is supposed to take place in the same universe as this story: https://pastebin.com/ekvRv7eX
Now the way I wrote all the characters in this story is very different from how they're written by P-Lucky. Like I said, I was pretty new to the writing game. I've only corrected spelling errors. So when you read this, please don't think the rest of my writing is this bad! I have gotten better both in grammar and general plotting. Enjoy!

>Be anon
>Wake up in the morning, in your bed
>Okay, not your bed
>The Bed you’ve been sleeping in for the past few weeks
>With a little monster gal
>Who’s green fur isn't in your arms at the moment
>Kind of a shame
>Its pretty cold today in the monster world
>Holy shit is it cold, the covers aren't providing any warmth at the moment
>You sit up in bed and peer at the window, shivering
*Sneeze*
>Through the window blinds its bright as hell outside
>A quick peer reveals its snowing outside
>At least 3 feet outside
>NoclassforLoka.jpg
*Achoo!*
>You walk to the door leading to the main hallway of Loka’s room
>Suddenly, it opens up
>”Anon, the heats out”
*Sneeze*
>Standing in the doorway is your short, green haired ‘girlfriend’, staring up at you

>Shes got her arms crossed, clearly annoyed
> “Anon, listen, i know we’ve been playing it off that we’re in a relationship in front of-
*Chew~*
>You cover Loka in snot with a large sneeze
>Shes visibly disgusted
>”ANON! YOU FUCKING-”
>She runs to the other side of the hallway and shuts the door
>You hear the water running in the bath
>You knock
>”Anon, dear, i don't know human anatomy, but for all i know-”
>Suddenly, another voice interrupts her
>”Hey, anon”
>You look behind you
>Its Jennette
>Shes also shivering, wearing what appears to be her natural school attire
>”Anon, listen, as a cold-blooded monster, can you get Loka out here?”
>You knock on the bathroom door once more
>”Sorry I'm busy” Loka says
> Of course
*Sneeze*
>”Loka, get the fuck out here! Im cold!”
>The only sound emanating from the restroom came running water and occasional splashes
>”Fine. Anon, come with me” Jennette says, the short dragon-girl grabbing your hand as she walked into yours and Loka’s room
>”I know what you’re thinking, but judging from those sneezes, i think we both need each other’s warmth”
>Before you can disagree, you sneeze again

>Jennette gets into the bed, stripping off her skirt and collard shirt, only wearing her panties.
>You blush, expecting to see her breasts, but compared to Loka she barely has any bumps, never mind not having nipples
>Obliging, you climb into the covers
>You are beset with the dragon girl’s claws once underneath the sheets
*achoo*
>”Smart move to shave off all your fur those many months ago, ay big foot?”
>You try to say something but you get a mouthful of scales, as Jennette climbs unto you and shoves her forehead into you
>You cant help but get a boner
>Coincidentally, Jennette is clinging with her legs on your belly right above your crotch
*Sneeze*
>”Jesus anon, cover when you sneeze! I'm covered in yeti flem”
>Suddenly, the door of the room flings open
>”Anon! Jennette, you fucking-”
>Loka stands in the doorway in a bathrobe
>She drops it with shock and pulls out her claws
>Goodview.jpg
>Loka jumps on top of Jennette, grabbing her throat
>Shes on top of Jennette on top of you
>Think fast nigga
>Before Loka can take blood, you grab both girls in your arms and pull them close to your chest
>They are both in your arms now, struggling
>Eventually Loka calms down, her face flush and red.
>Although Jennette is wrapped around you on your right side, Loka is on your left
>pulled right up to your face
>You pass the day like this underneath the covers of a warm bed
>Eventually, you hear a metallic object rattling
>Jennette leaps out of your arm
>”Heats on!” She proudly proclaims
>She turns around with an arm on the back of her neck
>”No hard feelings, right Loka?”
> Loka sneers at Jennette with disgust, but you cup her chin and pull her into your gaze
>”Yeah sure but you owe me”
>You kiss Loka as Jennette skedaddles out the room
