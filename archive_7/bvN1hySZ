By Teether


>Another dreary, cloudy, day looms overhead as you sit in the grass waiting for your bus 
>You play with your phone hoping that the bus driver hurries the fuck up so you won’t be late for class for the hundredth time
>”Hey Anon! Whatcha doing?”
>You look up from your phone to see your new neighbor, Chloe the hyena girl, as she practically looms over you with a giant toothy grin
>If her voice didn’t alert you to her presence sooner, her heavy wild hyena scent would’ve
>Chloe stands about a foot taller than you and wears torn, dark, blue jeans covered in cigarette burns along with a ratty punk band t-shirt small enough to show off her midriff. Over top of the shirt she wears an oversized, beaten and ancient looking hand-me-down black leather jacket covered in random claw marks and lightly reeking of cigarettes smoked long ago and those of more recent times.
“Nothing chloe ju-“
>”’-just playing on my phone’, You know Anon, you should try to come up with a better catch phrase day after day if your trying to avoid me” said Chloe with a slight pouty face
“I am not trying to avoid you, its just…just…….i dunno” you say fumbling your lie as your heart begins racing
>Chloe had only moved in next-door two weeks ago and from the moment she set eyes on your adorable meekness, she knew she wanted to claim you as her own
>Everyday since you first met, Chloe would greet you at the bus stop and everyday you would stall for time till the bus arrived as a dejected Chloe walked back to her house
>”You’re afraid me? Afraid I am gonna eat yah?” said Chloe pulling back a corner of her mouth to reveal all the sharp teeth on the right side 
>You flinch at the display
>Out of all the beastfolk in the world, you felt most wary about hyenas. If their reputation was to be believed, you had every right to feel scared
 “N-no, I just don’t…..I mean…..ughhhh” you moan before dropping your head into your hands to avoid the question
>”Hey anon look! I brought you some breakfast!” Chloe nervously giggled
>You look up from your hands to see a barely cooked hunk of meat dripping in Chloe’s out stretched right paw
“Uhhh I usually don’t eat raw meat from strangers” you say as your stomach churns
>”But……but…I am not a stranger…..…I picked you out the choice cut and everything” said Chloe, her ears beginning to droop
>You sigh and take the chunk of mystery meat from Chloe out of fear more than anything
>You can barely tear a piece off of the chunk as blood oozes into your mouth
>You try hopelessly a couple more times before giving up and handing the chunk back to Chloe
>”Hmmm I knew you humans had blunt teeth but I didn’t think they were that harmless” said Chloe taking the chunk and easily tearing a big piece off in her teeth
>You flinch every time Chloe chews as her teeth make short work of the meat in the most beastial-looking way possible
>Chloe sucks down the last scrap, smacking her jagged, blood-covered teeth and lips together as you watch in horror
>Chloe catches your upset gaze, “What?”
“N-nothing” you say quickly averting your eyes
>Chloe firmly grabs your chin so your eyes face her own, “You know Anon, the more you hide from me, the more interesting this is gonna get”
>You tremble slightly, unsure of how to respond
>Luckily for you, the bus shows up right on time
>You quickly pull yourself from Chloe’s grasp and rush onto the bus, plopping down in a front seat
>You wipe the panicked sweat from your forehead, happy to be away from the wild toothy monster
>A heavy thud lands in the seat next to you as you look over
>Chloe sits with her legs splayed and her left arm behind your headrest, trapping you in against the window
>No escape from her teeth, no escape from her stench, no escape.
“What are you doing? This is MY school bus” you say peeved
>”Well, it just so happens my transfer went through to your school. This is MY bus now as well” said Chloe as she rubs her left leg gently against your right
>You feel like you’re going to be sick
>”Hey by-the-way, wanna be my boyfriend?” said Chloe moving in closer to you
>”No” you barely tremble out like the previous hundred times she asked you 
>”Hmmm, you say no, but I think you really mean yes” says Chloe bringing her jaws close to your face
>”No, I-I mean it!” you spastically blurt out
>”Mmhhhmmm sure you do” hummed Chloe as she grabs your wrists with her left hand and forces your arms over your head, pressing them up against the glass window
>”P-please don’t” you say as you try to avoid the inevitable
>”Just face it, you’re mine.  My very own little human boy toy” Chloe whispers in your ear as the smell of raw, tinny, blood from her breath wafts over you
>You start to sniffle as Chloe rubs up along your right thigh with her right hand, making her way to your junk
>You feel tears well in your eyes and a choking in your throat
>”All mine” whispers Chloe again before she starts kissing your neck
>You start to cry, tears streaking down your cheeks, “I said stop!” you choke out
>”Too late” whispers Chloe before sliding her right hand down your pants and groping your dick
>You flail wildly in the hyena’s grasp as you begin to sob hysterically
>Chloe holds on tight but the louder you cry and the more you thrash, the more she slowly gives way
>Chloe is soon back on her side of the seat as you curl your knees into your chest, sobbing openly to yourself
>You bring your wet eyes up and scan around the bus
>Everyone is looking at you
>Now everyone probably thinks you’re an even bigger crybaby then before
>A wadded up paper ball hits you in the side of the head, soon followed by giggles from the back of the bus
>You press your face into your knees as you try to pretend that everyone else doesn’t exist
>”I am sorry”
>You lift your head back up and look over at Chloe sitting with her head slightly down
>”I am sorry, I didn’t know you weren’t into that sorta thing” said Chloe quietly
“What sorta thing? You mean literal rape?” you mumble out 
>”Look, it wasn’t…..its not like that…..you were supposed to be into it” said Chloe looking down into her hands
”Says who?” you say with a little more gusto
>”Says….fuck…..i dunno…..every hyena ever? Its just whatcha do….you know….to get in the mood” says Chloe 
“First of all, I am not a hyena, Second of all I am riding the fucking bus, and third, I am NOT a fucking hyena” you say gaining more ferocity in your voice
>Chloe’ ears droop, “I…..I just wanted you to like me”
“Yeah, well I don’t. You’re terrifying and smelly is what you are” you say without thinking
>Chloe gets up from your seat and walks to the back of the bus, sitting down in an empty seat of her own
>You unfurl from the fetal position and stare out your own window
>You feel heavy with guilt, though you can’t figure out why
>She did try to rape you after all, its not like your not justified in telling her to fuck off
>But still…..
>You glance back at Chloe’s seat, the once energetic and perky hyena now looking miserable as she spaces out her own window
>You turn back, rubbing your hands in your eyes
*Fuck man……just fuck everything……




>The rest of the bus ride to school feels like a blur
>You hesitantly look back at Chloe a couple times, seeing her still miserable, staring out the bus window
>You mostly spend the ride inside your own head, wondering if you did the right thing
*No fuck her; she’s just like the rest of the bullies. Trying to push you down and take whatever they want
>If there’s ever anything you needed less of, its school bullies
*But she didn’t know any better, she’s probably spent her whole life around other hyenas, you can’t fault her for that
*Like hell I can’t, fuck her
*She’s just trying to be nice
*She’s just trying to get something from me
*Are you really this paranoid that you can’t just be flattered for once?
*Flattered? About what? Being some beastfolk’s plaything?
>You hate to admit it, but that last thought made you feel slightly aroused
*Just push the feeling back down, nobody wants you for you, they just want what they can get out of you
>You sit still as your mind goes blank, feeling the numbing blanket of depression bearing down on your body once more
*Maybe if you didn’t recluse so much you’d have friends….maybe even a girlfriend!
>”Alright were here! Get off the bus maggots!” screamed the drunk bus driver
>You grab your bag and slowly walk off the bus, suddenly not feeling so urgent about getting to class
>You walk under the shade of a nearby tree and wait as you watch the rest of the students get off one by one
*None of them are Chloe
>You wait a couple more minutes before realizing that Chloe is sitting on the bus alone
>You look over at her window as you see her quickly advert her gaze from your own
*She’s purposely avoiding me
*I really actually hurt her…..
>You feel the heaviness of your depression increase as you turn and head off towards the school
*Goddammit, I am a fucking monster
>A plastic bottle filled with rocks flies threw the air smacks you in the side of the head
>You stagger as your mind rings, the dark bruise already forming on the side of your head
>Howling laughter and giggles come from all sides as you open the front door and head inside the school
*I deserve this……




>Most of the school day follows your normal routine
>The same teasing, fighting, bullying you’ve come to treat like background noise
>You learned to also ignore all the bruises and cuts you’ve come to accrue
>New bruises and cuts fade, quickly followed by fresh ones anyway
>You’ve tried to do everything in your power to make it stop
>But trying to make it stop only makes it worse
>The teachers are apathetic
>The school is apathetic 
>Everyone is apathetic
*I am apathetic…
>Your left….all alone, to endure whatever’s thrown your way
>Alone…..
>You just want to be left alone
*Is that so hard?
>……
*Whatever…..”It is what it is” and all that shit……
>…….
>You can’t shake the feeling like a pair of eyes has been intensely watching you all day
>You shrug it off as more paranoia and continue along with your day





>Finally, it’s all over
>School is finally done for the day
>All you have to do is make it back to the bus in one piece
>You take a side route through the school, trying to stay out of the public eye as much as you can
>You make it out the front door with very little harassment and walk across the concrete towards the direction of the idling buses
>Before you can blink, a gigantic hand grabs you by the back of the shirt and pins you up against a school wall
>You mind swirls but you already know who grabbed you
*Rex
>Your eyes adjust to see Rex the bear holding you up off the ground by the front of your shirt as his two cronies Flit the weasel and Alex the human stand beside him with shit eating grins
>All three sport knock off brands of expensive clothing and are one of the main sources of your bullying
>Rex is one of the tallest students in the entire school, sitting about three feet higher than you and weighing about ten times more
>Rex romps around school with very little oversight or consequences. You assume even the teachers are afraid of the big stupid brute seeing as how all his grades are oddly passing
>The three ganging up on you had become such a common occurrence that you gave little thought to the ritual
>Rex smacks you over the head with his free hand, some of his claws scrap your forehead and cause it to start bleeding
>”You got my money like usual, worm?” said Rex in a very assured tone
>You stick your hand into your pocket
>Your blood runs ice cold
*Fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck FUCK FUCK FUCK!
>You pull out both pockets, spilling everything out onto the ground
*There’s no money, but….I always have it….always! FUCK!
>You hear Rex let out a deep yet forced sounding laugh
>”Well…You know how this goes Anon, guess were just going to have to break your pathetic little head in” said Rex pulling back his free hand into a fist, ready to break every bone in your face
>You scream and shout bloody murder, hoping someone will hear
>Rex just laughs even harder along with his two stooges
>Rex launches his arm forward towards your face as you close your eyes waiting for the impact
*I deserve this……
>You hear a rush of footsteps as someone sprints towards you and full on head butts Rex in the ribs, knocking him sideways as you fall from his grasp
>You open your eyes as your butt smashes onto the concrete
>You see Chloe with rage and bloodlust in her eyes, all of her teeth showing 
>Alex takes a swing at Chloe but she quickly dodges before planting a fist square in his gut
>Alex collapses while Flit whips out a tiny stiletto and charges the hyena
>Chloe meets Flit’s charge with her own as she punts the small beastfolk like a football into the side of a nearby car, knocking him out
>Alex gets back up and tackles Chloe now enraged
>He brings up his fists and starts pummeling away at Chloe’s face, each hit pounding away with resounding cracks and thuds of flesh hitting flesh
>Chloe reaches over and grabs Flit’s dropped small stiletto, ramming it as hard as she can into the Alex’s side
>Alex screams as he falls over, blood dripping lightly onto the ground from the small protruding blade
>Chloe gets up and quickly kicks Alex in the face with a loud crack, knocking him out cold
>You hear the angry grunts of Rex as he gets back to his feet
>”Stupid, smelly,  bitch….do you even know who your messing with?” says Rex holding his bruised side
>Chloe takes off her leather jacket and takes up a brawler position with her fists
>”All I see are a bunch of two-bit pussies thinkin’ they’re hot shit” said Chloe clenching her fists before charging towards the bear
>Chloe lets loose a barrage of fists on Rex’s stomach with little effect as Rex quickly counters with his own punches
>The punches hit with the force of a sledgehammer as Chloe’s knocked back, a bloody canine rocketing from the side of her mouth as her lip splits open
>Rex laughs, cracking his knuckles as Chloe tries to catch her breath
>Rex gets closer but not before Chloe leaps towards his face
>Rex lets out a choked gasp as Chloe clotheslines the giant bear back down into the concrete
>Chloe waists no time, climbing onto the enormous beast and pounding away at his face with a twisted look of joy
>Rex’s arms drop by his side as he stops responding
>Chloe grabs the front of Rex’s bloody shirt and brings his battered face close to her own
>”This human is MINE understand me? I claim him as my own! From now on, if you lay a single finger on his little head I WILL gut you in the most painful way I know how, got all that?” said Chloe snapping her jaws
>”mmmmhhhhmmmmhhmmmm” mumbled Rex through a bruised aand bleeding face
>Chloe punches Rex in the side of the head
>”I CAN”T HEAR YOU” she shouts into his face
>”Yes…..yes….no…no touching Anon…..” dribbles out the bear
>”Good” smiles Chloe before slamming Rex’s head back into the ground and climbing off of the giant beast
>”AND THAT GOES FOR THE REST OF YOU TOO, GOT THAT?” shouts Chloe around at the lingering crowd 
>The crowd is a series of nods and light yes’s
>Chloe wastes no time, quickly grabbing her coat off of the ground and running over to you
>Now that Chloe’s closer to you, you can see the extent of battle damage on her body
>Her face is bruised and bloodied as a steady red drip comes down from the side of her mouth and nose
>It’s obvious that Chloe is in a lot of pain but tries to hide it as she grabs your hand
>She begins leading you back to your bus
>The two of you sit once more in the same front seat from earlier this morning
>……
>…….
“Thank you for saving me, I probably would have left school in pieces today if it weren’t for you” you say meekly
>Chloe doesn’t respond as she digs through her bag on her lap
>The hyena pulls out a couple tissues and motions for you to get closer
>”Here, let me help clean you up” she says in a gentle tone
>She rests your head in her lap as she swabs away the mostly superficial blood on your face while ignoring her own flowing cuts
>A couple quiet moments pass
“Chloe, why did you do it, why did you help me?” you try to say in as quiet a tone as you can muster
>”Because you needed help” said Chloe matter-of-factly, looking down at you
”But…why? I don’t deserve your help, there’s nothing remarkable about me” you say looking back up at Chloe
>”Your remarkable to me Anon, you’ve got a gentle soul, a soul that needs protecting, a soul that needs love” said Chloe in a very warm manner
>You space out, not sure how to exactly respond to an answer like that
>”Plus, that gentleness is a huge turn on” Chloe says blepping  her tongue out at you
>Your face flusters as you look away from the hyena
“Look, I am sorry for what I said earlier. You’re not terrifying or smelly. I just never met a hyena before…you know.....I-I am just an idiot, a stupid idiot” you say as a smile crosses Chloe’s face
>Chloe runs a light hand across the side of your face, “Yeah, I am sorry too. Believe or not I haven’t spent anytime around humans till I moved here. I came on too strong, sorry”
>”Apology accepted. Let’s just go back to square one, how about it?” you say
>”Sounds good to me” said Chloe, her voice regaining some of its liveliness from earlier
>A couple more quiet moments pass as the last few kids get on the bus 
“So you told Rex that you ‘claim’ me….what does that mean?” you say still looking away from Chloe’s face
>”Why, it means I am your protector….that….and also girlfriend” says Chloe wiggling her thighs together and flicking her tail
>You don’t answer as you can feel yourself getting hot under the collar
>”I-I mean…..you don’t have to be if you don’t want to…..I know I came on a little strong for you earlier….so….you know…..you don’t hav-“ said Chloe with sadness
“Yes”
>”Huh?”
>You sit upright in your seat as you turn to Chloe, “I said yes, I’ll be your boyfriend”
>Chloe’s eyes light up and grow wide before she tackles you over in the seat
>Chloe is on top of you, rubbing her face enthusiastically against your own as she gives out a light yeen giggle
“What are you doing?!” you barely get out through awkward mouthfuls of Chloe’s face and neck fur
>”I am marking you with my scent, so no body gets any funny ideas” she says as her distinct musky smell transfers onto your clothing and skin
>Chloe pulls you up against her chest, wrapping an arm around you as she leans against the bus window
>Everything about this feels so weird and alien to you
>But you think your beginning to like it
>You nestle in closer to your protector as her strong arm squeezes against you
>Chloe looks down at you and plants a light kiss on your forhead as you both smile at each other
>You close your eyes as the guttural engine of the bus roars to life
>You calmly drift to sleep, completely safe in the ever watchful gaze of your protector
