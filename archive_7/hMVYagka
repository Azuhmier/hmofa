Chapter 1: Enterlude
>The cafe you're sitting in has music softly playing over the loudspeakers as you casually sip your coffee
>You've been there waiting for quite awhile now, hoping that you weren't getting stood up again
>A while ago, you downloaded a dating app that may have come off as a scam
>Fiddling with it on your phone, while sitting in a corner booth, it still comes off as questionable at best
>Why wouldn't it be?
>It's an app specifically for Humans looking to meet up with Anthros for a date
>Closing out of it you briefly scan the time
>11:25 AM
>Your date had previously messaged you saying she'd meet you here at 11:30, so you still had time to wait and see
>All you could do now was drink your coffee and tune out the music

>You are Anon, a human as standard as they come
>Your name is a bit of a joke, considering you aren't normally from around here
>Yes, the universe had decided to add you to the long list of mysteriously disappearing people from the old world and has instead dumped you here with a slightly more diverse population
>Anthros are what they call themselves
>It was mildly fitting since ferals ran about too
>Still... it was weird to watch a business woman, er, poodle walking a breed at least twice as large as her original form on your first day here
>Being the guy that you are; you just sort of went with it
>The acceptance mostly came from the handy BHA people telling you that a return trip hasn't happened before nor ever will
>So you buckled down and decided to live this second life to the fullest
>You've had a few attempts at dating Anthrs in the past since being dropped here
>A tiger, a bear, even border collie at one point
>Your preference quickly becoming the cat anthro ladies
>So sleek, cuddly, and refined - you just couldn't help yourself
>A small bell rings you out of your inner monologue and the door just down the row of seats shows the source
>A slim, athletic looking cheetah woman walked in looking around for something
>You could feel a smile form as you finally felt lucky this time
>She spots you and walks down the aisle
>Being the gentleman that you are, you stand to shake her hand-paw
>Or were they grabby pads?
>Whatever. It didn't matter then and it sure didn't matter now, but you did want to rent a biology book at some point. Shits weird on an evolutionary scale though
>You gave your free hand a wave towards the booth you were previously occupying
>The two of you slide on in on both sides
>Her smile is just as warm as yours
>"Anon, right?" she goes first
>"That's me," your coffee now largely ignored, "and you're Amy? It's nice to meet you"
>Through the introductions you've been (hopefully) stealthily studying her
>Her fur is a bit longer than other cheetahs you've seen, and her tail looks so much fluffier to match
>She also has short brown hair and striking light green eyes
>Her clothes are simple: jeans that hug her nicely and a blue shirt done up in a way that shows a bit of midriff
>"You know, I wasn't even sure that you'd show up. Thought that app might be a scam"
>She looks you up and down
>"That's your opening line? Smooth"
>Her smile changed to a grin while a paw desperately tries to stifle a laugh
>FUCK
>You freeze for a second, though a quick facepalm snaps you out of it
>"Fuck sorry, I'm just pleasantly surprised to find such a pretty lady on that app"
>Her smile returns as she leans over the tabletop
>"See~ That's much better! You're actually the first person I met with from that 'scammy' app"
>"Oh I am? Why's that? No way people would've skipped your profile!"
>You caught a lazy swish of her tail, an ear in turn flicking lightly
>You're still trying to get a read on their tells, but for the most part you think you've got it down
>Happy, you hope
>That smile of hers is captivating, you can't really take your eyes off of it
>"I got a lot of messages on it but most of them were creepy"
>Both of your eyebrows start to rise
>"So, I'm not a creep then?" you do finger guns at her and pull off a goofy smile
>"You are now," she laughs
>You couldn't hold it back either
>"So Mr Creep, tell me a bit about yourself! Lets trade facts!"
>"Hmm..."
>You give a mock pause as you look off to the side
>"Where to start. Oh! I work for EverTECK as a graphic designer for their ads"
>She was leaning forwards before, but she made a show of it to go even farther while her ears are fully swiveled towards you
>"Your turn Amy," you finish
>"Uh.. I work as a barista at PawBucks," her ears are folded back, eyes dropping with them
>"It's... It's an ok job, pays the bills, you know?" her grin looked a bit forced
>Time to change the subject!
>"My turn then - and this is a big one! I'm Anonymous, came here 2 years ago"
>She snaps to attention at that
>"Oooooh, so THAT'S why your profile said 'Anon,'" you're hoping she isn't straining her neck at this point, "that's cool! What's your other world like?"
>You think for a moment
>"Well, s'far as I can tell it's pretty much the same as here. Small differences though. The cold war wasn't as hot here one guy told me, and uhh," you weren't quite sure how to explain it, "Anthros don't exist there too. In art and other forms, but yeah"
>"NO Anthros? Like NONE?!" you aren't sure she could fluff out even more if she tried, "How is that possible?!"
>Some of the other patrons seem to be glaring your way
>fuck em
>"Dunno, it's all humans there as far as I'm aware," you gave a small shrug
>She finally settles back down into the booth cushions, eyes almost unfocused as if she tried to process the concept
>"Wow, that must of been weird to see us walking around then"
>You gave another expressive shrug on your end
>She blinked a few times, that warm smile you were previously entranced with back
>"Kudos on actually trying to date an Anthro like me"
>You're almost beaming back
>"Want to get out of here and hang out a bit Amy? Could go to your place or mine, or even catch a movie or something"
>Physics couldn't even explain how large her fur was floofed out now now
>"SURE!"

>Her enthusiasm was borderline infectious
>A quick wave brought a relieved server, who hurriedly took your bills
>Not even the low grumbles from the other patrons could dampen your spirits
>Well, may as well give them a show
>In the most dramatic way you could think of, you played the role of a two-bit duke
>After all, royalty had much better flair than a gentleman
>The British accent may of been a bit much, but with an arm and a bow, she graciously accepted both as you pull her from the chair
>Walking down the aisle and seeing all their faces made it all worth it
>The door received similar treatment as the two of you left
>The two of you were openly laughing once again on the way to your car
>You had to do it, now that no one else was around
>"MMM YES M'LADY," with your last go at an accent while you held the door open
>The fact that she hasn't scolded you yet must of meant her humor was similar to yours
>As the two of you calmed down, it was only then did the question of where her car was came to mind
>But she was faster than you, at least sprinting
>"Come on, we can get to know each other better at my apartment" she said over the sound of a car seat adjusting
>"And yes, I do have a car, but I walked"
>The instructions she gave you weren't that far at all
>The drive itself only took a couple of minutes
> you pulled you car pulled into the lot of an apartment complex
>these apartments are, well they exist
>not so run down that they are slums but they aren't high standard by any means 
>as you walk in you see a few other Anthros walking in
>they seem somewhat surprised to see a human around
>making your way up the stairs you notice a few cracks in the walls and a few busted lights
>"here we are!"
>It wasn't long before you found yourself on a spacious couch
>The interior of her apartment was, to put it simply, rather nice
>Currently she was down on the floor, her head and arms digging around in a basket of DVD's and other media
>That poofy tail of hers swayed around as she did, and after finding one she motioned behind her
>"I've got the usual stuff drink wise, but if you wanted something stronger than coffee check the freezer. I think I have some good vodka stored away; if you want anything else it'l be in the cabinet"
>You had only enjoyed the comfort of that couch for only a minute as you soon found yourself in-front of her fridge
>Finding the freezer, you quickly discover that she wasn't kidding around
>There are quite a few flavors, from things you'd only consider as mixers, to the vanilla flavored shots and black cherry special
>Unsure of what you wanted exactly, you turn around and find the cabinet she had mentioned
>Various kinds of rum, whiskey and beer could be found inside
>A bit much, but it didn't really bother you
>You were in college once, you had kept several different kinds of alcohol around for your various friends tastes
>Hidden, of course, and most of it being rum and coke
>Digging through her fridge again and finding a few cans of coke, hear the sound of a tv turning on
>Stopping briefly you looked out, "What'cha want?" you ask her
>"Uh, a bottle of vodka, any kind, and a cup with some coke, please" you hear back
>Bringing the goods to a small wooden table in front of the couch, the both of you mixed your various drinks
>Settling in, a quick drink for taste confirmed a perfect mixture once again
>It was so perfect, you already finished it
>Now, being empty during a show just could't be allowed
>So to your surprise you had already finished a second one
>Or, maybe a third
>Wait, what happened so far? You aren't exactly sure where in the movie your at
>You're staring into your empty, heavily stained cup now
>The TV wasn't making a whole lot of noise as before, either
>A little ways away, you hear stifled laugh
>Amy is trying to keep her drink steady while her other arm is curled over her stomach
>It's been some time since you had seen such an assortment
>Cheap beer was all you really could afford since coming here
>Something about this was all too familiar
>You vaguely remember doing this often; hosting these movie nights with various friends and the people they brought
>You were the guy who could buy all the good stuff and somehow keep it hidden
>An unhealthy amount of it
>You couldn't have gone through it all then, but despite that you did
>You remember the cost always being a little more every time you went
>The bags always slightly heavier
>The dorm always getting emptier
>And then you remember having nothing
>No house, no college, no friends... nothing to your name except the clothes on your back and whatever you held
>You remembered the fear of those agents finding you in the streets, and the cold that followed while they explained
>How does one cope with losing everything?
>You didn't notice the cup being crushed between your grip
>People back there could lose everything, but still have something
>A house, a car, the insurance and government helping them, a family
>You remember reading about some people arriving with whole towns, buildings, places of wealth such as factories and wineries, and other such things
>But you
>You had nothing.
>your world goes black to the sound of white noise from Amy's TV and Her soft breathing

Chapter 2: Pursuit of Happiness
>With great effort you wake up enough to quickly shut your eyes again
>You played the pain game with your eyes as harsh light forced its way in
>You lost
>A few minutes of rubbing your face and you're finally standing well enough
>You think you're standing, anyways
>Fuucckkkk, you had too much to drink
>A dry heave or two later and you still felt softness on your back
>You managed to crack an eye open this time, somewhat able to keep it that way as you gazed forward, mildly confused
>For some reason, the ceiling was looking back
>Looking down your legs were stretched and hanging over the side of the couch
>Well, you were half right
>A tactical roll to your left had you on your stomach now, and you decided to commemorate this achievement with a small groan into the padding
>A wild grab at the table beside you looking for... something, only brought the sounds of cups falling to the floor
>"Nice," you mumbled, tentatively placing a foot on the floor
>The other followed soon after and you could now consider yourself sitting
>Just a little bit more effort to go and then you could cross one thing off your checklist
>Your eyes were mostly open now, and before you were various bottles of vodka, rum and cans of coke strewn about
>A light retching heard behind you connected the things together
>A quick cough from you made you a little uncertain yourself
>A hand on the side of the couch led you to shakily place another on the hall's wall
>Even with a headache, you had to make sure she was ok
>Also, the bathroom probably holds the meds
>Feeling your way down the hall you stood in front of the open lit bathroom, where an over sized cat looking a bit more frazzled than usual was doing her best to choke the porcelain
>"H-hey, Anon," she pitifully moans out before retching into the toilet, her fur standing up a bit more
>"Hey Amy," you say, unsure of what else to do
>You busied yourself with another face rub as the sounds continue a bit more
>She looks like death, but she's still looking your way now
>"...Got any ibuprofen? I have a killer headache," a self massage doing nothing for you
>"Medicine cabinet," was all she said face buried back in the bowl
>Moving inside and looking at the mirror above the sink, you honestly couldn't consider yourself photogenic either
>Hair is a mess, bags under your eyes, dried... something, you assumed was drool on your cheek
>A quick splash of water from the sink below rinses it off
>You dry off with the only hand towel in sight and pry open the mirror
>It swings out, revealing a pharmacy's worth of bottles
>Not really sure what to look for, you randomly start grabbing bottles
>Drugs in hand, you start going through the labels
>'Mr. Pibb's longhair'd vitapills'
>'Pepto-Bismol, 5 symptom digestive releif'
>'Xanax'
>Some sort of card you grabbed with a pictured of a much more alive looking Amy and a large green leaf to the side
>A generic multi vitamin
>'Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft fun pack,' two of which appeared empty
>'Tylenol,' close, but not what you were looking for
>A large bottle of dietary pills; it felt a little empty and the label showed a mouse wrapped in measuring tape
>Not sure how you managed to grab this either, but in your hands was a small bag of
>Flipping it over and looking at the little cardboard clip showed a feral cap rolling around happily on one of those scratching boxes
>Whatever the reason, the bottle of Ibuprofen was hidden way in the back
>Having it now though, you popped four of them back
>The sink water didn't taste all that bad either
>Another rub on your face, another quick little heave
>You finally put on a smile
>The sides of it hurt a little
>The sound of splashing water to your side seem to slow
>A little more together, you walked as fast as you could to the kitchen
>Finding and pulling out a bottle of water, you were back a minute later
>You hold out the bottle to Amy, still hunched over and heaving a bit
>She tries to grin at the gesture, but it sours and she's back in the depths
>A small "thanks," accompanied it
>When the sounds died down again, you wet the hand towel and held it out to her
>"Hey, Amy?" you start while she made a move towards it
>"Uhh?" she paused, an arm outstretched
>"I'm going to go grab us some Gatorade and a pizza or two, ok?" you place the cloth into her hand
>"Uhh huhh," she coughed, "gimme red ones..." she was busy wiping off her lips
>You leave the bathroom and begin gathering your things
>Keys - somehow easily found
>Wallet - right where you left it
>Phone - Dead and useless, but still here
>You wiggled your toes a bit, feeling carpet underneath
>..."Where are my socks?", a quick look around and another wiggle to check
>Whatever
>You pull on your shoes and head out
>Opening the door revealed it was still dark out
>Usually for you blacking out meant it was morning
>You made your way to your car and starting it up the dash told you it was about 3 am
>That's what happens when you start drinking at noon, you learned
>You plug in your phone and start driving to the nearest Paw Mart, thanking whatever bastard came up with that name and forced it to stay open 24/7
>A short hop in and out and you were on your way back, various flavors of Gatorade and microwave pizzas behind you
>When you returned Amy was stretched out on the couch moaning softly
>"Anon?" another moan
>"Yea Amy?" you answer handing out Red gatorade
>A quick pull on the plastic and soon you were chugging yours down
>"Did- Did we do it?" she moaned-turned-groaned, her muzzle pressed into the couch and blindly clawing at the offered drink
>"Uh... I don't think so," once again you met her halfway, a paw quickly closing on the bottle
>"I can't find my socks though"
>You're already cracking open another one
>The meds helped your hangover, and it was a hell of a lot better than Amy's, but you still felt like shit
>"You got mad they were mismatched (they weren't by the way,) and threw them off the balcony"
>You looked out the window and spotted one of them in a tree just outside
>"Goddamit," another swig
>"Look, I'm really sorry Anon," her chin was resting on the couch back eyes shut tight, "I think... I think I ruined this date"
>You sit on the couch next to her, her head still supported and yours to her side
>You brought a hand right between the ears and started to lightly scratch there
>"I don't think it was ruined, I think we just... over indulged ourselves," a soft purr could be heard, "Next time lets just go to a movie or get dinner, or something"
>Your hand briefly left her, she had rolled over and her head found its way to your lap
>"You mean it?" she's looking up at you
>You nod, rubbing between her ears
>"Yeah, I mean it," the purr was a stronger now
 

 
>It's been about two weeks of seeing Amy
>She tries to spend every moment of her free time with you
>Not that you were complaining, of course
>Your short time together showed you she's a smart lively girl
>You felt, and hoped, she enjoyed her time with you
>A thought in the back of your mind gave you the smallest seeds of doubt
>When you would stay over, and in constant need of headache medicine, you noticed things here and there
>What you later found out to be a bag of catnip, it would always be continuously refilled
>On a nights when she wore a particularly small shirt, a line or two could be seen running through her fur all around her arms
>With you, whatever you two did she's all smiles and laughter
>A night ago a new one had appeared
>You could never do hard drugs
>Even back then, in your constant stupor you couldn't consider it
>But you couldn't lie that at one point in your life... you had
>You didn't blame Amy, not when you had the need to cope as well
>The catnip, the bottles, the... scars
>All of those substances back in your world were regulated, she had to have been given them from someone reputable
>The inclusion of Anthros though did throw a wrench in your previous world knowledge on abuse
>Catnip couldn't be what you thought it was, right?
>Right!
>Your arm around Amy gripped a little tighter at that while the two of you were snuggled under a blanket
>Her eyes were glued to the TV, some horror movie you found was on it
>You didn't have one but you could only wince when she bit down harder on her tail during the jumpscares
>Speaking of
>Hackles raised and her tail tip twitching, you looked back at the TV just to see a giant man with a giant pyramid for a head
>He was in the middle of pulling the skin off some poor guy, and after a particularly wet rip and another squeak beside you, he threw what was left away
>Her eyes were wide open, pupils the size of pins and was doing her best to huddle into your shoulder
>You made a move to pet her head and she jumps from your touch
>"AAAHHH NO NO NO!" she dives away from your hand and off the couch, the blanket thrown in self defense and smacking square into your face
>"Mmmfsworry," came your muffled reply, shaking it off
>Look around showed the viciously vibrating head of a cat barely over the back of the couch
>You gave a barely restrained chuckle, trying again to get between her ears
>"Relax, relax!" contact established, you gave a quick pet, "This isn't even a scary movie!" another laugh from your mouth
>You're glad petting seems to be one of the few universal constants here, every motion calming her down
>She crawls back over, a small "sorry, I'm just.. jumpy," along the way and tucking close by while you drape the blanket back over
>Her tail is quickly back in her mouth
>Alright, you had to ask
>"Uhh, don't take this wrong or anything," you point at her tail while she looks your way, "That biting your tail thing? Why do you do that?"
>She cocks her head at that, eyes widening in surprise a few seconds later
>She fidgets with her floofy tail a bit more
>My mom is a snow leopard, and its just something we do..." she starts off slowly, "I mainly do it when I'm nervous or scared," she's back to nomming on it once more
>You furrowed your brows at that, you thought you knew your old world species rather well
>But now that you think about it, she did appear a bit... fluffier than before
>Still
>"Huh? I thought you were a cheetah," it was your head that tilted now
>"Mah da ish chheatah, mah ma isha shnep," another loud noise, a muffled chirp and a slight poofing out followed
>You blink, "What? I cant understand you through all that tail Amy"
>She dropped her tail again, an odd look on her face
>You had some skill on reading muzzles, but this was a new one on her
>Your only clue was her deeply folded ears
>"My dad is a cheetah, and my mom is a snep," she turned back to the screen
>A loud noise shouted from the box, and she was perfectly still
>"...So I'm a hybrid," you barely heard over the noise
>You returned to the movie as well
>You weren't aware hybrids like that could exist
>In your world, hybrids came with all sorts of problems, the only real famous one you remember being ligers
>You didn't fully know what the issue was, specifically
>Probably health related
>You would have to ask your only real trustworthy source Jasmine, that tiger agent who would call you periodically
>Amy was still rigid, the only signs of life her slowly moving chest
>Shit, she didn't take your silence well
>With a surprised "Mmrwah?!", a first from her, was all you heard as you pulled her close and wrapped the blanket tighter - an impenetrable bastion protecting the two you
>Your damn right you made your efforts known
>You felt her arms quickly slide around your torso, a heavy pressure following her tight hug
>She in your arms, you in hers, you cautiously pet her side with your fingers softly digging into her silky golden fur
>You felt and heard her purring close to your chest
>"Yer teh besht ehnon"
>"What?" she somehow had her tail chomped on again
>She's fast at taking it out, too
>"You're the best Anon. Being cool with Anthros, and especially cool with dating... me," a pause in the vibration, but you revved that up quick-like with a traveling hand back to her head
>With that, you snuggle her closer, her tail right in her jaws while the two of you sat back and watched
>She was practically vibrating then
 
 
>You're alone in your bathroom staring at the mirror
>An old toothbrush, some mouthwash, and a half empty beer bottle decorate your sink
>Today is a special day, for it's been about a month since your first 'date' with Amy
>A very special day indeed
>A week ago, you dipped into your meager savings on reservations for her favorite sushi restaurant
>There was still some time left, and you've already spent a bit of it here
>It was a nice restaurant, the quality of its service fully realized after the payments were made
>Almost too nice
>So you wear your only tie and suit outfit, the same that was donated from the agency
>With what little you had, you came here to freshen up
>To wash your face, comb your hair, brush your teeth
>You were dirty, inside and out
>The mirror stared back
>In it was a man with a loosely draped tie, unbuttoned dress shirt, messy hair... and with emotionless eyes solely on you
>It's gaze dropped to the side, and you followed it
>You found yourself looking at the bottle
>All you could do was stare; its the one thing you've accomplished so far
>The mirror starts to move, the motion attracting your gaze to the clean and tidy medicine cabinet
>It's easy to keep clean when its empty
>The rest of the bathroom was the same
>Dull cheap tiling, a basic toilet with a few rolls on top, and a stale white towel over the small metal rack on the shower stall's door
>What a pity
>Talking to Jasmine had brought some things to your attention
>The most important being unsurprisingly, the people here were assholes to those they thought beneath them
>Amy didn't deserve that prejudice against her, that almost tribal thought process being especially sickening to you
>The other one she mentioned was worse
>Some of the others brought from your old world had been given so much
>They came here with more than they had way back then
>But not you
>You didn't bring the great job at a fortune 500 company here
>Nor the high rise apartment in the center of a metropolis
>Haha, it's simply the worst
>You made do
>You had too, after all
>A shitty one bed apartment down in the suburbs, payed for by a graphic design job at a fur product company
>It was enough to live, but you didn't truly live it
>The universe thought it fitting to kick you down, hard
>Alcohol, your favorite vice became a treat
>Good for the body, bad for the soul
>Whenever Amy had mentioned a new bottle she found, your nights would get a little brighter
>A few more binges were had, but none on the level as that first night, and certainly not as before
>An Anonymous 'favor network' helped a lot of the time, where others similar to you did the best they could to help when they can
>It was mostly in the form of jobs, simple requests, or a room to stay in
>You don't know why you didn't decide to leave, as the cases of 'you' appearing were quite rare here
>You run your hands under cool water and splash a bit on your face
>You glance at the mirror again, the door of it having been closed a little while ago
>You could end i-
>"Shut up"
>Your glaring now, tired of that little voice
>You could try again, just like last time
>The beer bottle found its way into your grasp, lightly hovering over the sink
>You had a date today, a 'real' one at that
>The sound of cheap beer draining down the pipes barely registered to you
>The fucker was finally silent
>Being with Amy helped keep it that way, and somehow you thought her's did too
>You quickly go through the motions getting yourself ready, and soon you're finally presentable
>It was chilly around this time, and you slipped on the nicest jacket you had
>It was a long, long drive to the restaurant, your mind on Amy and Jasmine, your new and your old life the only things distracting you
 
 
>The thought of good food and a great date were all you could think of as you pulled into the lot
>Real sushi, authentic sake, some needed cuddles, maybe get to see if it's different down there than what you're used to
>You crossed your fingers at that last one
>You found a parking spot rather easily, your head swimming around a single person
>It smelt amazing on the inside, and the noise around you meant the others here came with the exact same reasons
>A large Akita wearing a culturally appropriate getup led you passed the tables
>Small conversations and laughs were seen here and there
>Each booth was it's own little world to friends or families or people like you wanting a good time with someone
>The guy you walked past seemed to be especially killing it, playing a pretend game of keep away with his sushi from a one armed Maned Wolfess's speedy chopstick grabs
>Your head had been on a constant swivel looking for that cat, and you finally spot her sitting by a corner table
>Outpacing the Akita, you got behind your target and trapped her in a tight hug
>"Anon! Don't startle me like that!" she gives another one of her squeaks you adore, but the taste of fur gets in your mouth
>"Sorry! You're just too cute," you finally say, letting her go after her surprise tail smack
>You drag the other chair from the other side, and set it right next to her a little bit to the annoyance of your waiter
>He doesn't keep it long, handing you the menus with a short bow
>A "thank you" from you and he's gone
>You feel her tail snake around one of your legs as the two of you look and point at the various choices
>With your orders memorized, you got up and made your way to the center counter
>The dish of the night primarily being sushi, you had to ask what you wanted for it to be made right on the spot
>Two stubby little Shiba Inus prepared it in no time at all
>You had a pretty even spread, and hers primarily of salmon
>You honestly weren't surprised by that
>The two of you made light conversation as you ate, the company being more than enough
>Along the way the things the both of you wanted to do came up
>She wanted to go to the beach and learn to swim
>The only thing you could come up with is any kind of convention around
>Both would probably happen, you'd make sure it did
>A content sigh and a small nuzzle later, she once again brings out that purr
>Those emerald eyes of hers were open, the ones you cheesily worried you'd get lost in stared up at you
>The moment felt right
>You put an arm around her, and you lean in for a kiss
>You couldn't describe the relief you felt from the whiskers tickling you slightly; her lips meeting yours
>She pulled you in closer, and you swore those vibrations from her purrs will forever resonate in your soul
>You wanted nothing more than that in that one singular moment
>Regretfully you finally break and breathe in, the smell of her perfume intoxicating
>You did it, the proverbial pastrami and other Italian foods fully locked in your pockets
>You're celebrating with another hug when one of the Inu chefs from before returns, check in hand
>You take it with a nod, and she leaves after a short little bow
>Your meal consisted entirely of sushi, so you got up from your seat, a little hesitant at first, and made your way to the counter to finish the night
>You didn't even look at the price on the register
 
 
>You stood there, staring as you usually do
>It wasn't in the usual forms of confusion, apathy, or even through a drunken haze
>There was a stiff smile on your face, your movements likewise, with your eyes as cold as ice
>A fox was in your seat, an arm around your girl
>A sickening aura of confidence wafted off of him, joined by whatever the shit he threw on his fur
>You didn't care about his looks or his colors, or that his unusually muscular frame distanced him from his entirely subby species
>Amy's eyes widen quickly finally meeting yours
>You quietly brought up a chair and placed it near the two
>The fox stopping his ranting when he finally noticed your sitting form
>The fox gave a "who the hell are you," but your attention was on Amy
>"Hey babe, finished paying the bill. Who's your friend?"
>"Anon, this is -"
>"Bingle," his paw shot out, and you grabbed it in turn
>The fox is looking you over, you just now noticing his blue eyes as he does
>"Hm? Another Hybrid Human couple," a shake, "The world is getting weirder and weirder," you gave a firmer one back
>Your other one is curling at your pant leg, only unwinding at the soft touch of Amy's nervous hands
>"Ah that's nice and what do you do Bingle?" he returns it a little harder at that
>His pressure is reactionary, but now he starts leading the charge
>He's a predator, he thought he had you down in this little game
>You only smile a little bit more at that one summer's hunting trip with in the woods all those years ago
>And it only grew even more, the thought of your father disappointed that you didn't join the Military, teaching you the skills all the same
>The spars giving you all the lessons you'd need, and in the end it didn't matter that you never beat him - special forces never lose
>Bingle clears his throat, the two of you still tensely locked in place
>"I get to work with and... bed, beautiful ladies like Amy"
>You were at a comedy, first class and front row as your smile never stopped growing
>"So you work in pornos," you cut him off mid preen
>He huffs, though quickly he regains his composure
>"I was just seeing if Amy here would like to join me for a session," how typical of a person like him trying to steal another one's woman
>"I think she'll pass," you reply tersely, "Let's go babe"
>You let go standing up, bringing up a flustered Amy with you
>Bingle rose just as fast, releasing your hand while he did
>"Why not let the Halfer decide for herself"
>You... looked at Amy, her eyes were wide with hurt
>Your smile, gone, turned into a scowl just for him
>A smug grin sits on his face
>"What, did the halfie's little hummy not like that?" you prayed he was trying to be funny
>Amy's hand covered her mouth as her other was quickly trapped in Bingle's
 
 
>You thought if he could, his next words would have been "Let's go,"
>What came out instead was a strangled, choking noise drowned out by the gasps of the others around you
>He was pulled out to the aisle, leaving behind a scared looking Amy gripping the table trying to stand back up
>He quickly found his muzzle a foot off the table
>It was silent
>"Let me tell you something about Humans," you began, one arm still on him and the other pinning his own
>Your jacket lied on the floor somewhere around you
>"Our faces evolved to take beatings," you continued, Bingle still struggling in your grasp
>"They take it so well that, even after getting one, most of us will be fine - days later, even"
>You were slowly inching his face downward
>"Now how about yours? How does a long, thinny snout like yours help?" he was trying much harder now, you pushing him further and further with your well toned arms
>"What would it do in that situation," he was almost thrashing in your grip
>"Not very well, I'd guess," and you quickly brought his head crashing down
>"WAIT!" he choked out, an inch off the wooden table
>You brought him back up, relief on his face from your loosened grip
>"No, you're right," you began, nodding a bit, "wouldn't want to damage the table"
>He crumpled after the first hit, you knew you felt something give from the warm liquid running down your closed fist
>All he could do was gasp at you, yourself kneeling down to his level
>"Next time, take a hint"
>he coughs and spits blood, a canine and a premolar from his bruised mouth
>He twitched in a nod at that, and promptly passed out
>You have an arm over a shaking Amy while the staff huddle around Bingle
>In their faint broken English, you thought one of them whispered "karma a bitch," while the others seemingly agree
>Amy is hunched over as you walk, both arms gripping her tail between her chest and nervously chewing
>It didn't matter how she got here, you soon had her by your side in the car
>The tears were uncontrollable, her tail trying its best to catch them
>You drove back one handed, the other on the small of her back rubbing in slow circles the whole way
>"I'm not a half breed"
>"I'm still a predator cat"
>"I am good enough"
>It was her mantra
>"I know," being yours
>You park, holding the still sobbing Chep ball up the stairs
>It wasn't important that it was hard, you made do and before long you had her on the couch
>You left to grab some drinks, and for that blanket from that date a long time ago
>As you walked back, the sound of crinkling plastic mixed with the occasional sob
>She didn't see you standing there, just out of sight - your eyes trained on that small bag of catnip
>She ate a handful of it, slowly curling the bag and stuffing it under the cushions
>You took a few steps back, this time making noise
>One of her ears flicked at that, then both as you sat beside her
>Blankets wrapped around you both, you holding her close while the last of her sobs trailed away
>A slight shift caused the sound of plastic, and none of her ears moved
>Eventually she falls asleep, the fur on her face matted but dry
>This past month had been extreme highs and deep lows, but you didn't know what you felt now
>"I know, more than you think," you mutter, you rest your head on hers, the two of you leaning back
>You closed your eyes and drift off to sleep

Chapter 3 Guillotine 
>To say that things were fine would have been a lie
>You never asked Amy about her past because it didn't matter to you
>You didn't need to know and she never wanted to say, as who she is now and how she is with you was the only thing on your mind
>Every moment free from work you'd be with her
>Ever since your interaction with Bingle you've noticed some changes
>Changes you didn't like
>On a night when the two of you didn't work in the morning you dug around her medicine cabinet looking for floss
>You didn't question why her prescribed bottles where full and unopened - she must have had a refill earlier
>When you saw those same bottles a week later and untouched you again started to worry for her
>She would always brush you off whenever you brought it up, with a few of them being more hostile than normal
>It was those days where you never saw or heard the bag
>Over time she would steadily get more jumpy around you
>She also seemed more stressed than normal
>You were never a 'pill pusher' but you knew she should take them
>The antidepressants and Xanax from your world served the same purpose as the ones here
>During a particularly bad day for her she had kicked you out when you brought up her meds again
>On the drive back home you had to know what the catnip was doing to her
>The only source you knew, Jasmine the tiger told you was disturbing
>"While it's different for every cat, the general rule of thumb is if it's eaten it acts as a sedative; if sniffed the cat will go crazy"
>"It's a very strong stimulant or sedative depending how it's used"
>Amy has been eating it almost every chance she can when she thinks you aren't looking
>Your life has been filled with concern lately
>Who wouldn't be?
>What you thought was just a harmless bit of fun turned out to be meth or opium depending on how it was used
>You were scared for Amy
>It drove you to stop drinking eventually
>So you came up with a plan to fix this, working longer hours and earning lots of overtime
>You did everything you could to promote the business to get small bonuses too
>You decided you both needed a break
>You called in favor after favor from the Anonymous network, and saved every penny you could
>And soon after, you had a week set aside at a small beach in California, ready to go
>Yeah, the drive there would take forever but you promised her she would learn how to swim
>A whole week away from everything to better yourselves and enjoy each other
>You were in your room the day of and hurriedly packing your bags while on the phone with Amy
>She wanted to know if you felt like hanging out
>"Yeah, sorry babe I can't come over today," you said stuffing some floaties into a bag, "I'm bogged down with something from work , I hope you understand"
>There was a noticeable pause on her end
>"Yeah," she finally said
>There was another pause
>"Yeah. I understand Anon," she finished
>She hung up after that and you wondered what kind of tone that was
>You felt terrible for lying to her
>The trip had to be a surprise so she wouldn't have time to stash more Catnip into her luggage
>You busied yourself with packing your bags full of things you would need for the beach, and seeing you were still missing a few things you were on your way to the store
>A new swimsuit for you, three beach towels to lie on, and a trunkload of snacks for the long road ahead
>Only then would you be ready to give her the news
>On the quiet drive to the store a small thought grew in your mind
>When you told Amy your lie you assumed she would be sad, or even disappointed
>That call kept buzzing around only getting louder and louder the more you drove on
>It got so bad that you turned back around in the middle of an intersection getting honked and yelled at all the way
>Maybe you should surprise Amy first, you reasoned to yourself, as that way she could choose some snacks too
>Even with the radio on and your windows down for the cool summer wind you couldn't help yourself tapping on the wheel
>As you step out of your car in front of her apartment, you aren't quite running but you aren't quite walking either
>You hoped you ate something bad last night from the gut feeling you had
>You unlocked the door as quietly as you could thinking Amy would be on her couch
>The usual sounds of her TV didn't greet you like you thought it would
>It's very quiet in her living room as you make your way to a window
>You stood there perplexed, her car was parked as normal
>You could already see that she wasn't in her open kitchen, so it only left her bathroom and bedroom
>The light wasn't on and the fan wasn't running, but the door to her bedroom was closed
>She didn't sleep during the day when you were around, and you reasoned it was to be with you
>But, you had to check
>Just in case
 
 
>You couldn't even think as you opened the door
>There was Amy in her room, your poor beautiful Chep was there, unmoving and floating above the floor
>You didn't care that the door slammed into the wall
>You didn't care that a lamp was shattered in the living room
>You didn't care that her knives now lay strewnn across the kitchen tiles
>It didn't matter that a raw red line ran across your arm as you ran back to her
>You furiously cut the belt that tied her to the ceiling fan, dropping the knife and catching her after
>You set her on the down as quickly as you could
>Not a whisper could be heard when you hovered over her mouth
>Grabbing the knife you sliced off her shirt, pressing your head to her chest and praying to anyone listening
>You tensed at every passing second, but finally thinking you missed it a faint beat could slowly be heard
>Your hands shaking, you thought back to your time in school
>The deranged memory of chest compressions to the tune of staying alive and rescue breaths came forth
>You placed your hands where you hoped was the right place, never having done them before and especially not on cat
>"Come on Amy, breath!" you shouted between your rescue attempts
>You put all of your weight into one final push, your fear of hurting her pushed back
>A weak sputtering cough joined in your panting
>You wasted no time holding her head and taking all pressure off her chest
>Her coughs became harder before she finally settled
>Her eyes flicked open and settled on yours
>"A-anon?"
>You enveloped her in a fierce but gentle hug as she continued to wheeze in your ear
>"Jesus fuck Amy," you silently cry with her fur catching every drop, "why?" you'd constantly say
>"I'm sorry, I'm sorry," she'd said at each and every one
>Your shirt was as wet as the fur on her shoulder but you knew this is where you were meant to be
>With your Chep in your arms and you in hers
>After an eternity you pull away
>"W-why, Amy? Why would you do this?" you motioned to the belt pieces laying on the floor
>She didn't meet your gaze as she slowly curled down
>Her features drooped the smaller she was and wrapping herself as best she could with her tail that sat in her mouth
>When she finally spoke it was slow and thought out
>"I... thought that you were tired of me," she quietly said and wrapped herself a little tighter, "you were at work so much, I-"
>A small sobbed broke through a shudder
>"I thought that you saw what that fox saw in me," you didn't think she could sink any lower
>"Don't you dare finish that," your arms shot to her shoulders
>You untangled the ball of fur before you, a hand cupped under her chin
>You lifted it up, slowly bringing her wide eye'd stare into yours with that fluffed tail of hers still firmly stuck in her jaws
>The rain threatened to fall again
>"Don't ever try to say that," her eyes started to close from the sudden petting on her head
>"God, you stupid, beautiful Chep," your arms found themselves around her once again
>"I would never be tired of you," you whisper behind her head on your shoulder, and with slow circular rubs along her back
>"I was working overtime because I wanted to save up for today," you say lightly scratching behind her neck
>"I wanted to surprise you, but... I didn't know it would go this bad," you felt her soft padded hands start to shift around your sides
>Your shirt started to stain from the small rolling tears down your back, and little trails from your own began to run across her fur
>"I'm sorry Anon, I just figured that it was me being a nuisance to you," you heard her say
>Your hands dug into her silken fur with your hug being even tighter
>"Don't do that to me again Amy, I love you too much to lose you"
>She pulled away from you, her eyes wide and glistening with tears
>"You love me?" she didn't look to believe her own words
>You plant a light chop on her forehead and your own eyes still wet with a laugh leaving you
>"Yes you doofus, I love you"
>Her tail starts to snake up to her mouth again
>"Promise me that if you think anything like that again you'll tell me"
>You stick out a pinky
>After a moment's hesitation her own padded pinky rose and locked with yours
>"I promise Anon"
>Another hug holds her close
>"I wouldn't want to be in a world without you Amy"
>"And I wouldn't want one with you Anon"
>You felt her tail curl around the two of you
 
 
>After a few hours of snuggle talking, a quick bandaid to your arm, and even more snuggling you felt it was time to discuss what should happen
>The two of you are on her couch silently watching the TV
>She looks to you while you muted it
>"Ok Amy, we have two choices right now," you start while holding her paw
>She must of known what was coming from how quickly she looked at her footpaws
>"Either we take you to a psych ward, get you weaned off catnip and have you on constant watch..."
>Her tail was back in her mouth from the words that you hated the sound of
>"Or... We go to this vacation I planned," you're smiling at her questioning gaze
>"and we stop your habit cold turkey with fun, swimming and snuggles together"
>Her ears perked up at that
>"I- you," she paused while her eyes sunk into pinpricks, "You knew about the catnip? For how long?"
>"Since day one, I found it in your medicine cabinet. Now, what do you say?"
>"You promise you'll still love me through it all? Even through... withdrawal?" you heard the doubt in her voice starting to show again
>You nod, and held her other hand
>"I promise"
 
 
>The drive to the cabin took awhile
>With every mile you drove, the stress of the day seemed to melt away
>You hoped you'd never have to live through it again, but you'd bear it all the same for Amy
>It was never a burden to you
>Instead of arriving in the early afternoon like you had originally planned you instead walked up to the beachfront cabin just before dusk
>You still were able to unpack and found a nice sandy beach spot to start up a bonfire
>The two of you were sitting on a log of driftwood with your arms tight around her and her head on your shoulder
>She had started shivering though
>It only meant one thing: her symptoms started to show
>For once in your life with Amy in yours, you didn't worry
>You had already steeled yourself for this moment a long time ago
>You wouldn't drink during this trip, and you'd make sure she didn't either
>It barely registered to you that you never had the craving for it since
>The cold dark comfort of alcohol paled to the small light beside you
>It was a light that nearly extinguished itself, one that you swore you'd never allow to again
>A dumb goofy grin started to spread across your face
>It formed from the shivering bundle beside you giving a defiant purr through it all
>You snuggled into her and she cuddled back
>"I love you Amy, we'll get through this"
>"I love you too Anon, I know we will; together"
>You knew without a doubt you'd get this little light to shine brighter than ever before
>The purring in your ears and the tail close around you gave you all the strength you could possibly need

Chapter 4: Something about your love
>You are three days into your vacation with Amy
>Withdrawal had finally come and hit harder than a ton of bricks
>She was currently in your arms shivering and stammering while you sat on a driftwood log near the beach
>The sun had started to sink in the ocean, and with its orange hues blazing with life
>Your little Chep couldn't enjoy it with her face pressed up into your neck
>You were tired and constantly confused about what to expect
>What are withdrawal symptoms for cats? For her?
>You still couldn't pin catnip on anything you remember from that old world
>This new one had too many random confusing things
>The puffball in your arms anchored your thoughts
>You could always count on knowing one thing
>You loved Amy, more than you thought you could love another
>"A-a-anon i-i d-don't feel good," she moaned into your shirt
>"P-please Anon, just a l-little, j-just a bit"
>It broke your heart to refuse her from the knowledge that she was suffering because you wouldn't allow a hit
>But you knew it was better in the long run
>With you sober and her clean, you knew you would be invincible together
>She was a shivering, shaking ball on your lap
>So you pulled her a little closer with your chin on her head
>Even through it all that base feline need to nuzzle broke through
>You helped her get more comfortable on your lap
>When she had settled down a little more, your sang a little tune for her
 
>"Just looking out on the day of another dream"
>"Where you can't get what you want but you can get me"
>"So let's set out to sea"
>She finishes it for you crying into your chest
>"Cause you are my medicine when you're close to me"
>"When you're close to me"
>You sang the verse a few more times
>After your sixth go at it, the tears let up into a gentle purr on your chest
>"T-thank y-you Anon, I-i just w-want it t-to stop"
>You hugged her closer and kissed her forehead
>You earned a quick ear wiggle at that
>"I know baby, I'll help you through this, and we'll get through this together"
>The sun finally set to the rise of a crisp ocean breeze
>Oh how you love the smell of that salty air
>Another breeze, and you felt invigorated with an almost surreal sense of belonging
>The Chep in your arms blocked the cold from the thoughts that slowly crept on by
>Except, a single tiny little one managed to get through
>'Why?' it would ask
>You thought you drowned it from binging a long time ago
>You don't know why, what, or how to anything it ever asked
>It was one of the first questions you ever had the moment you popped up here
>Was it for her?
>You spent days trying to answer that question way back then
>You remember being alone and afraid, and you thought that was the reason why
>You eventually pieced enough traces to read up on a theory by another Anonymous member
>"The selection process only picks anons that are 'important' for something. It doesn't matter how old or young they are"
>Bollocks to that one
>Even if it was true, two years is a long time to wait
>A small shiver broke through your brooding
>You looked down at the now sleeping Chep who must of spent all of her energy shivering
>If you had a purpose, you hoped she was it
 
>But that wasn't important enough right now
>You scooped her up in your arms and the purring only got louder
>You felt it buzz from your chest to everywhere inside you
>She made it incredibly hard to carry her back to the cabin
>You aren't weak per se, but carrying a full grown big cat can be a bit of a challenge
>A slightly twitching, buzzing and handsey one at that
>You chose to live with it, just like all the other times
>When you're finally inside you gently lowered her onto a blanket draped over the couch
>It took some effort, and a bit of rolling, but you managed to get it all around her
>You now have a Furry burrito
>You couldn't admire your handiwork for long as your stomach decided to growl
>Taking care of Amy had a toll on your body
>You weren't really paying attention to your own needs every moment she was awake
>It was a day ago when you essentially forgot to eat, as Amy couldn't keep any solids down
>You were opening a pack of ramen when you had a strange feeling inside
>Every time you were there for Amy that almost pleasant sensation would be there
>Is that what love is? you hummed to yourself
>Taking care of someone at your expense, hoping they will do the same?
>You stopped what you were doing, and you walked over to the counter top
>A purring furry burrito was currently snoozing away on the couch, and even when you turned away the feeling never left
>So you suppose it doesn't even matter
>Hiccups and hairballs and all, you knew you love her
>...And you also knew she needed to eat something
>You went back to preparing a meal for the two of you
>Still not feeling entirely hungry, you picked back up the ramen cup
>You finished your preparations by looting the cabinets for two bowls and a strainer
>And now, all you had to do was wait
>Thankfully it wasn't long, but you did almost fall asleep to the constant white noise being generated
>You caught the noodles into one bowl and the broth in another
>Still, this wasn't a real meal
>some green onions, some bone broth powder, and a few eggs later, you had the two bowls in your hands
>It's a not really filling, and unhealthy as can be, but it's at least something she can have
>Fingers crossed
>She must of woken up while you were cooking
>From the smell alone you weren't surprised
>With a little effort she managed to get both paws from her shell
>And in the first time for awhile she was almost eager to eat it
>Finally able to relax you joined in on her eagerness
>You rubbed her ears gently while she slowly drank from the bowl, with yours being finished pretty quickly
>The petting and purring never stopped until she was down to the last drop
>Before long, she was already burritoed and purring even louder on your chest
>It didn't last long when the day's activities recaught up to her
>Out like a light
>You yourself felt pretty beat too
>Oh well, just one thing left to do before bed
>Thankfully it's the one chore you're always grateful for
>"I love you Amy," you whispered before kissing her forehead gently
>The beach and the sounds of a happy kitty whisked you off to sleep
 
>It's been a day since you came home from your vacation with Amy
>While not what you had planned for in a vacation it still had the desired effect
>Amy was effectively weaned from her drug problem and you were sober
>It wasn't without it's problems though
>You were at your apartment with Amy
>She wasn't 100% herself but she was much better off then before
>Her pained shivers and twitches had downgraded to soreness, lethargy, and persistent flu-like symptoms
>...But even then, she was better at function than before
>She still needed constant care from you
>You quickly setup a solution though
>When you were at work she would be sleeping, and when you came home she was awake and wanting constant attention
>Her fur snuggled against you every night you slept
>And when a headache wasn't killing her, that buzzing purring noise would wake you every day
>But you loved the near constant attention oddly enough
>The snuggles she gave warmed your soul and rejuvenated you, no matter how sleep deprived you were
>Her in your arms as you watched movies
>You cooking her dinner listening to her commentary on what she would change in them
>She had gone to college for film studies you learned one day, and the crates of DVDs she had were finally explained
>The movies distracted her and before long she would be the women you fell in love with
>Minus the drugs and alcohol
>Her smile was all you needed, even when she pulled you into a record store for 'real music'
She was everything you wanted and needed
>And you would never let her go

Chapter 5: Easier
 
>It's been a year since your vacation with Amy
>Her withdrawal had come and gone much to your relief
>She was happy, smiling, and most importantly, she was clean
>You were sober now, the only exception being a drink every once and a while
>Parties, a beer with a steak(you can't have steak without beer); those kind of occasions
>the company you worked for, EVERTEK had started being popular as well
>You had used a meme from your old world in one of the ads you made and it took off
>Apparently the meme never happened in this world
>You got a huge bonus and a promotion for it, and while not the same as your old life it was certainly better than before
>The two of you have moved in together into a nicer place since your funds had dramatically increased
>And ever since then she smiled so much more with that intoxicating smile
>She even started pursuing a career with her film studies degree
>She had been applying to various broadcasting companies with various degrees of success
>There was another one planned today, and you kept your fingers crossed
>You are standing in your kitchen preparing some bacon and chicken strips for chicken bacon ranch sandwiches
>When you are almost finished you hear the door opening louder and faster than usual
>A quick peek around the corner confirms your very happy kitty that was trying, and failing, to contain her giddiness
>"How did it go love?"
>You already know she nailed it, if her sudden tackle hug and kissing told you anything
>"Great! They offered me a position as a camera operator for a talk show! They said I can move up from there!"
>You rev up the walking purr engine with a rub between her ears as she talks about her interview
>"Cmon, I'm making those chicken sammiches you like," you say taking her paw when she calmed down
>"Wait wait lemme change out of these formal clothes!"
>Another quick kiss and she darts into the bedroom, and you go back to busying yourself with the food
>Avocado, mayo, tomato, lettuce, bacon and Tabasco sauce all join the mix
>You never liked the mayo bit but Amy loves it
>It still weirds you out that she would mix the avocado, mayo and Tabasco into a weird sauce to top it all off
>"Much better!"
>Amy walks out of the room wearing shorts and a tank top
>Every time you see her it takes your breath away
>You still found the air to whistle at her playfully as she enters the kitchen and grabs a soda
>"Yeah yeah you've seen me a thousand times"
>"I've seen the sunset a thousand times too, doesn't make it any less beautiful"
>It earns you a soft whap from her tail while she puts together her own sandwich
>Eventually you both collapse on the couch together, sodas and food in hand
>"What movie do you want to watch today babe?" she asks
>With your chicken and bacon delight halfway shoved in your mouth, you grab the remote and start browsing
>Not really finding anything interesting you turn to her
>"Whf mmfvie yuf hfve n mfnd tfdfey?" the bread channels your question
>She was in the middle of drinking her soda, but now she's coughing violently
>And with a slap on your back, so where you
>You both couldn't stop cracking up when you were finally able to breath again
>"Care to try again?" she asks, trying to dry up the wet spots on her top
>"What movie did you have in mind for today?" you get between coughs, "feeling any genre?"
>Her tail flicks side to side as she looks up with a padded finger to her chin
>"Uhhhhmm, something cartoon. But not Disney! I don't want to hear you sing along to every song again!"
>She still couldn't let it go that you were better at it than her
>You're scrolling through the movie section and notice her perk up when the cursor lands on a Nightmare before Christmas
>"What, this one? Don't make me put it on and expect me to NOT sing along!"
>You couldn't defend yourself in time from another fuzzy tail beating
>Scrolling through a few more you landed on a Ghibli classic
>"How about this one?"
>"Mmm? Oh! Yeah, Howl's is great!"
>"Wait, is that the one with Christian Bale?"
>You get a nod
>"Sign me the fuck up!"
>You're smiling when you start the movie from the feeling of fur snuggling into your arm
>"Love you Anon"
>"Love you too Amy"
>It's simple and overused, but you always fully mean it each and every time
 
>The movie consisted of a lot of snuggling, eating, giggling at the big bad's sweet juicy karma, and a lot of nifty trivia
>Basically, it was over too soon
>It's late out when it did, and through the credits you yawn loudly
>"Wanna go to bed love?" she purrs out
>You rub your eyes and mumble out "Mhm, long day"
>Her paws are on your back and rubbing gently, and when you're done with your eyes you pull her in close
>"Let's go then"
>You get up after and start turning off everything
>Amy is there with you and putting away the leftovers
>When you're both finished she meets you in the bedroom
>The moment you're under the covers, a big buzzing furry blanket wraps itself around you
>Her purrs get even louder when you return the hug, filling your arms with your furry chep and snuggling down for the night
>You quickly fall asleep from the happiness filling your soul
 
>It's been a month since Amy got her job at on the local broadcasting network
>So of course you had to celebrate
>You've been planning out this whole day, and when it finally came not even the drive got you down
>Your ball of fluff in the passenger seat got a little bit more antsy for every mile you got closer
>Soon, you arrived
>You had driven all the way back to the cabin on the California coast
>Amy was hesitant when you got out of the car carrying nothing involving the beach
>She still pushed through it when you held her paw and brought her to that log all those months ago
>Sitting down, she slowly joined you after
>She gave a small shiver sitting next to you, and your arms quickly found themselves around her
>The effect was immediate, and the two of you were still
>You sat there for awhile enjoying the ocean breeze and the company the two of you shared
>It soon became cold and dark, and after a minute of finding some wood a small fire warmed your bare feet and her footpaws
>Her tail is wrapped around your waist, and you decided that now was the time
>"Amy," you began
>It was the first time you really said anything
>"I have a question for you"
>Your nerves are almost shot from the effort
>"Hmm? What is it Anon?" her simple question shattered your fears
>You take her left paw into your hand, and slide a simple ring gentle over a soft padded finger
>Hey eyes are wide with tears starting to form
>"Will you marry me?"
>A cheetah, and a snow leopard - fearsome primal creatures known for the prowess in taking down prey
>You quickly experienced both with the two of you landing in sand
>"YES! YES ANON I LOVE YOU!"
>You're laughing and hugging her close with your hands petting her fur softly
>You don't believe you've ever experienced such raw and powerful vibes
>No matter what you think it would be, Amy's purring was stronger than that
>Laughing like idiots and getting coarse sand everywhere, you don't doubt for a second that life is going to be so much better
>A life that you both get to share


Chapter 6: I Belong to you
>You are standing around, nervous and sweating bullets while soft music is playing
>A lot of eyes are on you with different expressions on each of them
>Some were bored, understandably from the long wait
>But most of them were happy
>Even though this was a small ceremony you still didn't like standing in front of people
>Looking out into the crowd you spot a singular familiar face
>Jasmine made the time to be there, and she was sitting in the aisle on your side where your family would usually sit
>Family who would never know of this
>She brought along her husband too, someone you didn't really know much
>A few other Anonymous members sat there as well
>The past didn't matter anymore; you have a new family now
>And now it was time to make it official
>The sound of doors draws the crowd away from you
>But it was you especially that got sucked in
>Every nervous or awkward feeling you've ever had and remember just isn't important anymore
>Not when Amy is slowly walking down the isle towards you, in a beautiful flowing white dress
>The smile on her face is intoxicating, and holds a promise for everything you've ever wanted
>How could it not?
>She's gorgeous, but most of all
>She's happy
>You're happy
>Fuck everyone else who is not
>It didn't take her long to walk that short distance down the hall in this tiny church
>And when she's finally in front of you she's as giddy and vocal as you are
>You are trying very hard to keep your cool
>As expected, she was bouncing in place
>The only thing you refuse to restrain is that grin on your face the size of hers
>You assume words are being said by a man in some fancy clothes
>The music must have changed too
>The sounds and sights around you drift away as you gaze at Amy
>It took a nod from her and an inquisitive voice from the priest to bring you back to reality
>"Ah, welcome back Anon," you doubt the man ever frowned from his light laughter
>"And do you, Anon, take Amy to be your lawfully wedded wife," he continued
>"Through sickness and in health"
>Hopefully never again
>"Till death do you part?"
>It will never happen again
>"I do"
>You didn't even hesitate
>"And do you, Amy, take Anon to be your lawfully wedded husband, through sickness and in health, till death do you part?"
>Her green eyes locked on yours, with that radiant smile only faltering once
>You can't blame her
>Never did, never will
>"I do"
>You don't wait for the man to finish his speech
>You're already doing the whole mackin' out bit in public
>At least Jasmine joined in on the pre-cheering, with everyone else quickly following behind
>Doesn't matter if you became the king and lord of pasta from that stunt either
>For today was the start of the rest of your life
 
>The wedding was amazing and so was the reception
>Sure, a lot of the Anonymous members were essentially freeloading, but the 'free' entertainment from being completely smashed and trying to dance was hilarious
>Jasmine, of course was the most vocal of your guests, with Amy's family a bit more quiet and reserved
>They didn't talk to you, actually; satisfied with a wave and a hug to Amy
>A small roadblock you would have to deal with later
>As now you were in Santa Cruz, California
>More specifically a sweet hotel room with a great ocean view
>Amy's wedding dress is strategically placed(thrown) on the suite's couch
>Your suit parts didn't make it, having surrendered to the floor in a trail leading to the bedroom
>You spared the cup of water you're chugging down, and when you were done with the first one you poured another
>Have to replenish your fluids after all
>Looking over the plastic ridge, you find a dangerously seductive Chep walking out of a bathroom wearing some scavenged sheets
>They're poorly wrapped on
>You cannot overstate how beautiful she is
>A simple word for a simple truth
>Even more so when you can't help but slap on another winded grin while you look up and down her body
>A few steps in and she has a cup too, with the water disappearing just as fast
>With one hand around her cup and the other trailing down your chest, she soon lost what cover she had
>"Let's do it again~" she cooes to you as she sets the cup down
>A brilliant plan that tore through your armor
>You're already fully loaded
>...Not purely out of lust, mind you
>Hybrids have a much harder time getting pregnant
>But god dammit you were going to try
>You're little family is just missing a third, fourth, but no more than five
>Six is just asking for trouble with the budget you still have
>But even if it happens, life itself couldn't be better for either of you now
