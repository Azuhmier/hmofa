>Inspector Connie Lopine fidgeted in her seat impatiently. Across the desk from her, mostly obscured by a hoard of office supplies, was her employer...
>Director Lonnie Hoardwell. Hoardwell was once a respected private investigator, but had since retired from the game, opting to mentor a team of sleuths instead.
>The silver-scaled dragoness looked down her snout at the white wolf before her.
>"Well then. I suppose it's time for another report, is it? Inspector Lopine, have you found any leads in the... OTHER world?"
>Connie nodded affirmatively and retrieved her notepad from its usual storage space.
>"Yes, Director... I found a person of interest. I also found some signs of-"
>She was cut off by an inquisitive grunt from her employer.
>"Person of interest...? Please elaborate."
>"Very well... this person, Anon E. Mous... I believe he may be a possible point of interest in the case."
>"Is that so? May I see your notes on this gentleman?"
>Connie winced, but handed her notepad over. Director Hoardwell thumbed through with interest, only to break into smoky gales of laughter.
>"Connie... you fell in LOVE? My, my. I hadn't expected the other world to have such... an allure."
>Connie blushed beneath her fur and hat.
>"I-I... it wasn't planned, Director. Things just sort of... fell into place."
>"I see. Well, given your track record... I see no reason to press the matter at this time. So long as you have made sufficient progress in your investigation, of course..."
>"I have, I believe you'll find some information that interests you in this report."
>From her briefcase, Connie removed and presented an immaculately typed report. She smiled beneath the brim of her hat when she caught a glimpse of the other contents of her case...
>The prizes she had won at Looneyville.
>Ah, just looking at the cheap plastic knickknacks reminded her what was waiting in the human world: her Anon.

>...how long had it been since she left for Elsewhere? Connie wasn't all that good with time, especially since it worked a bit differently between the worlds.
>However, she was certain the week she had asked Anon to wait had already passed. Her heart ached a bit to think about him.
>He must be worried sick.
>Nonetheless, this was an important meeting, so she maintained her professionalism.
>Director Hoardwell read the report to herself, muttering and tapping her claws on her luxurious wood desk.
>"Mhm. Mhm. I see. Well, it seems that, as usual, you've returned with some useful information. Well done, Connie."
>The director dropped her icy exterior for a moment, and smiled warmly at her colleague.
>"...you're ready to go back, aren't you?"
>Connie hesitantly nodded, prompting another chuckle and plume of smoke from Hoardwell.
>"That's what I thought. Well... I'm sorry to say I can't let you go just yet. I need you to attend a meeting in two days."
>"A meeting... about what?"
>Hoardwell snorted, loosing a small burst of flame from her nostrils.
>"It's about Bonnie again. She's up to her old antics."
>Sigh.
>Bonnie tended to get a bit boozy on assignment. And she wasn't a civilized drunk.
>"What did she do this time?"
>"Well... apparently it involved copious amounts of vandalism. As usual, I expect all employees of Drakewing Detective Agency to attend so we can discuss proper behavior while on a case."
>Ugh. Every time Bonnie got drunk, one of these mandatory meetings happened.
>Especially frustrating for Connie, as she boasted a spotless record of conduct, a rare commodity amongst the ranks of DDA.

>Some deep part of her was a bit offended for a moment.
>Was Director Hoardwell suggesting that something about her conduct warranted a discussion?
>However, she soon discarded this thought. After all, these meetings were always mandatory for everyone, regardless of who acted inappropriately.
>A tiny, wry smile crept across Connie's face as she recalled the day that a meeting was called over Director Hoardwell's own behavior.
>She quickly buried this smile under a stoic, blank expression as the Director quietly adjusted some of the items in her hoard.
>All dragons maintain hoards, each one collecting items that have some meaning to them. In Director Hoardwell's case, her collection was a massive pile of various office supplies.
>Chances are, if you ever laid down a pen and turned your back on it in the offices of DDA, it'd end up in the hoard. This quirk initially grated on Connie, but she had grown to accept it over the years.
>Connie smiled patiently as her employer collected her thoughts and various bits of "treasure." Eventually, the dragon seemed to remember she was in the midst of a meeting.
>"Oh! Ahem. Is there anything else we need to discuss...?"
>"I don't believe so, Director."
>...wait. A thought came to Connie...
>"Actually... would it be possible for me to... call Anon in the other world?"
>The room fell eerily silent as the director drew herself up to her full, imposing height.
>"...you want to call him? From here?"
>Connie stood her ground, expression and voice never wavering.
>"Yes, I do."
>The director maintained her statuesque posture, then quickly deflated back to her normal slouch with an airy chuckle.
>"Alright, I don't see any issue with that. Except for one little matter..."
>...oh. Right, that.
>"...he's in the other world."
>"Precisely, Connie. I'm sorry to say there's no real way for you to contact him. Outside of, say... meeting him personally."
>Sigh.

>"Would it be possible for me to go get Anon and bring him here?"
>"Absolutely. Provided you can do it and still be back in two days."
>...bah. It was a three day trip at best.
>"Uh... is there anyone on assignment in the human world that could bring him around?"
>"No, no... you're the only one I sent."
>"Very well then. I guess I'll just wait for the meeting to end. Is there anything I can do until then?"
>Director Hoardwell tapped her fingers rhythmically on her desk, thinking. She quickly snatched a cigar from said desk and lit it up with a casual blast of fire breath.
>"Welll... there's been another report of Uno's antics in town."
>Oh great. Just the man Connie wanted to deal with right now.
>"Oh, that's good news. What's his angle now?"
>Hoardwell winked, puffing a large cloud of smoke.
>"That's your job, isn't it? Heheh. I think he's actually set up shop just down the block. You know the drill. Let me know what he's up to."
>Connie always wondered why the director smoked, being a dragon. Surely it didn't actually do anything for her, right?
>Oh well. Not important. What WAS important was her new assignment...
>...well, not much of an assignment, really. More like busywork.
>Uno was an infamous conman who'd been sighted around Elsewhere many, many times. Some people theorized he was actually secretly a brilliant crook.
>Truth was he just didn't learn when to quit.
>Connie had been assigned to get some intel on his latest scams many times. It was practically a weekly thing at this point.
>No matter how many times Uno ended up jailed, someone seemed to be willing to bail him out.
>Hm. So far, looking into this benefactor had never turned up anything conclusive.

>With her new assignment clear, Connie bid her employer farewell and left the smoky office. She made sure to collect her notepad and briefcase, but noted with a chuckle that she had lost yet another pen to the all-devouring hoard.
>Oh well. Not like pens are all that expensive.
>Connie stepped into her own (spotless, as always) office and put her briefcase away. She grabbed a spare pen, then set out to look for Uno.
>He shouldn't be too hard to find. Silver foxes aren't that common in Elsewhere, after all. Much less those with that ridiculous accent.
>Connie chuckled to herself as she left the agency's headquarters. Why would a known criminal nurse what is clearly a phoney accent?
>Surely he knew it made him easier to identify?
>Sometimes she wondered if Uno just liked being caught. Maybe he enjoyed the attention he got during investigation?
>Oh well. The inner machinations of his mind weren't important. What WAS important was confirming if he indeed had a new scam.
>Connie strolled down the street, enjoying the crisp fall air. She planted a hand firmly on her beloved hat when the wind got particularly rough.
>She eventually began to hear a familiar voice ring out from a rather shoddily-constructed kiosk.
>Uno.
>"Zmart phones! We gots ze zmartest phones in Elsevhere for the best prices! I am cuttink my own throat sellin' em this cheap, I zwear to you!"
>Yep, no doubt: that was her mark alright. She could see the gray furred fox hawking impressively realistic, but likely fake phones even from here. Unfortunately...
>He always seemed to get a few takers.

>Connie scanned her surroundings...
>Surely there was a quick way to expose Uno's phones as counterfeit. He likely didn't put much effort into them beyond making them look presentable.
>Hm. What if...
>Maybe if she could prove they weren't waterproof? Usually a real phone was (at least a little bit) water resistant; these fakes probably weren't.
>But to do that, she'd need water. And the only obvious water around is the fountain in the park.
>...she was gonna have to get one of those phones, wasn't she. Sigh.
>No way around it; she approached Uno's kiosk. As soon as he saw her, the fox grinned, revealing quite a few silver teeth.
>"Ah! Iffin it isn't luffley Lopine, here to infestigate little old Uno. Can I be interesting you in a zmart phone, my dear?"
>She drew herself up to her full height, towering above the rather scrawny fox. He, as usual, showed no signs of being intimidated.
>"Uno. You and I both know those aren't real. Why don't you come clean and save us both some time?"
>He gasped and put a hand to his snout, feigning outrage.
>"Vhy, Lopine... 'ow could you suggest little old Uno is out to be conning peoples of their money? I am a legitermate businessman!"
>"Uh-huh. I'm sure you are. Just like last time. And the time before that."
>"Bah, zose don't count! Peoples change, luffley Lopine, and Uno is no exception."
>She sighed and rolled her eyes. Of course he wouldn't just accept that he was found out. He had to play dumb.

>Well, to deal with someone like this, sometimes it takes a bit of playing along.
>"Alright then, if you've turned over a new leaf, would you let me demo one of these phones before I buy it?"
>The slim fox nodded vigorously, that same silver grin appearing.
>"Hof course I vould; anysing for a customer, eh? Take your pick, Lopine."
>Without any real consideration, Connie picked up the first phone that caught her eye.
>"Ah, exzellent choice. Please, veel free to take eet for a little zpin, yeah? Only for ten minutes zo. After zat I'll need it back, hokay?"
>"Of course, Uno. I'll have it back in 5, even."
>He grinned again as she walked away. Maintaining eye contact, she crossed the street to the park.
>Once there, she made a point of dropping the phone into the fountain, where it practically exploded. She quickly dashed back to Uno's, where he was already sweating.
>"Ahhh.... perhaps it vas a factory defect, yeah? Maybe you try another?"
>Without a word, she took another phone and repeated her actions.
>"A-ah. V-vell, eh,.. I suppose ze jig is hup. I know ze drills, Uno will be turnink himself in now."
>He stepped out from behind the kiosk, only to clasp his hands together and grin at Connie again.
>"Blast it, you are zimply too zmart for me, luffley Lopine. Perhaps old Uno should hang up his het and quit ze crime game."
>He leaned far too close to her, smile broadening even more and eyes glinting.
>"Zen again... hif I did that I vould never zee you again. I couldn't bear a week without my luffley Lopine! It vould, well, make me veak!"
>"How touching. And not at all what you say every week. Go on down to the station, Uno. They're probably waiting."
>"Hokay, yes, I vill be goinks now. Toodley-oo, mine luffley!"
>He practically skipped away to the police station, leaving his unsightly kiosk of counterfeit goods behind.
>Bah. Even when he left, Uno was a pain in the tail.

>As she watched the conman skip away merrily, Connie shook her head.
>She had half a mind to cuff him herself, just so he'd quit whistling. He was about to turn himself in! Why the jaunty tune...?
>She quickly made sure all her things were still there. Uno wasn't much of a pickpocket, but you still can't be too careful with his sort.
>Thankfully, he hadn't snatched anything.
>She looked over his "merchandise booth" with a mixture of frustration and amusement. She had to admit: he always put a fair amount of effort into making his kiosks look fairly nice.
>He almost looked like a legitimate roadside salesman, at times. Almost.
>...thinking about salesman...
>Connie pondered picking up a gift for Anon somewhere in Elsewhere. Maybe it'd help cushion the blow of her absence?
>But... what do you get a human man as a gift? Much less one like Anon?
>...she put her deductive skills to work.
>Anon enjoyed watching movies, going to the lake, trips to Looneyville...
>Connie felt herself getting emotional just remembering the good times with Anon. It hadn't been all that long ago, but...
>Her time with him was probably the happiest she'd ever been. She couldn't wait to get back to the human world.
>She smiled wistfully and pulled her hat down, masking a few sentimental tears.
>What else did Anon like?
>Oh!  He likes cooking!

>Well then, logically, there was only one option for the perfect gift:
>A cookbook.
>Connie called up the director first; better let her know that Uno was taken care of.
>"Director Hoardwell?  It's Connie.  Uno was selling fake phones this week."
>The dragoness snorted, amused.
>"Did they even dial this time?"
>"...I didn't think to check, actually.  I just dunked one in a fountain."
>"Ah.  Good thinking.  I suppose he turned himself in?"
>"Yes, as always."
>"Hrmph.  What a loon.  Anyway... keep up the good work, Connie."
>Smiling a bit, Connie bid her employer farewell and hung up the phone.
>With that case closed, she made her way into a nearby shop.
>The clerk, a grinning poodle, greeted her.
>"Good afternoon, Madame!  How can I help you this fine day?"
>"Err... I don't suppose you have any cookbooks, do you?"
>"Hmm!  I believe we have a few in stock... hoping to try out some new recipes?"
>"Me?  Ha, no, no... I'm not such a good cook."
>"Well, perhaps this is for a relative then?  Let me guess... it's your mother's birthday?"
>"Ah... no, sorry.  It's for a... friend."
>"Hmm.  Well, I won't pry!"
>True to her word, the clerk stopped asking questions.  The rest of the transaction was quick and painless.
>Connie waved goodbye as she left, a copy of Elsewhere's Finest Recipes tucked under her arm.
>She hoped Anon would like it.  Surely he would, right?  It only stood to reason.

>As she passed by the kiosk of counterfeit phones, Connie couldn't help herself.
>She grabbed one of the phones and dialed Anon's home phone number.
>...
>...
>Nothing.  Not even a ring.  She sighed and shook her head.
>She wondered how he was holding up...

<Anon>

>10 days.
>10 days ago, Connie left for her home world, leaving you alone.
>...it's been pretty rough to go back to being alone.  Though she wasn't around long, Connie's zest for everything made your life considerably happier.
>And now... she's gone.
>She'll be back, you're certain of it.  But...
>Her words echo in your mind.
>"...if I'm not back in a week, check inside your nightstand.  There's a map there."
>But, that's not all she said...
>"...I love you."
>Those three words kept coming back to you, filling your heart with warmth every time they did so.
>...you've made up your mind.  You're going after her.
>You yank open the drawer on your nightstand.  As promised, a very neatly folded map sits inside.  You unfold it and scan over it...
>A patch of woods is circled neatly, and a very elegant signature decorates the bottom corner, along with a message.
>"See you soon.  Love, Connie."
>Doesn't seem to be too far away... maybe a couple hours' drive?
>Not enough to keep you away from her, anyway.

>After a while of packing, you're all set to go.  You don't know how long your trip will take, so you prepare for a lengthy journey.
>You've got some extra clothes, your toothbrush, and some snacks, on top of everything else you may need.
>With that settled, you head to town for one last thing...
>You run into the candy store and buy a bag of jellybeans, then head to another store and buy a DVD of some generic action flick.
>Two gifts you're certain Connie will like.
>With your shopping done, there's only one thing left to do.
>You set your GPS for the coordinates Connie circled on the map.  Hopefully she's not in any danger...?
>Even though she said she'd be fine, you can't help but feel like a hero en route to saving the girl.
>What a thought.  You, a human window washer, rescuing Connie, a towering shewolf detective.
>Nonetheless, you start driving to the woods.
>As you drive, a rather strange vehicle catches your eye.  It's ahead of you, and traveling the same way you are.  It doesn't seem to be of any make or model you've seen before...
>Whatever it is, the black car cruises along at a rather dangerous speed.
>You vaguely wonder if the driver is headed the same place you are...?
>Surely not.

>Something about this situation feels kinda... off.
>You keep a safe distance from the car, and note with increasing concern that it's following exactly the path your GPS is recommending.
>A rational part of your mind speaks up.
>Obviously they're merely coincidentally going your way.  Failing that, something in their GPS is bugging out and getting... your... directions?  Okay, yeah, this is either a coincidence, or...
>Something else is going on.
>You squint a bit and read the license plate: 2AND3.  Odd.
>Something about the black car's swerving suggests that the driver isn't too familiar with the roads here.  You kinda wonder if maybe they're just lost?
>Alternatively, they could just be drunk.  That's not at all unreasonable.
>As you ponder, you absentmindedly speed up, getting closer to the car than you'd like.

<???>

>"Uh... I think we got a tail."
>"Hardy-har-har.  You've made that one several times now, Dub.  When are ya gonna get some new material?"
>"Uhh... no, no, I mean I think we're bein' followed."
>"Whaddaya... oh, I see it.  Yeah.  Well, leave 'im in the dust!  That's what yer paid for."
>"Uhh... okay then."

<Anon>

>Once you get fairly close, the driver throws the hammer down.  They peel out, leaving you a great distance behind them.
>Hmmm.  Odd...

>Should you...
>Nope.  Nope nope nope.
>Speeding up to follow that car is just asking for trouble.  You've seen enough movies to know better.
>As a matter of fact, you even actively slow down just to ensure they don't think you're following them.

<???>

>"Uh... we lost 'im."
>"Wait, already?  Then that wasn't no tail, you dimbulb!  That was just some Joe Schmo who got a lil too close.  You're worrying about nothin'."
>"Uh... I dunno, Trip.  Something about that car, uh..."
>"Uh... he says.  Wake me up when this sentence is comin' to a close, kay?"

<Anon>

>The black car slows down just a tad, but remains a fair distance ahead of you.  You're not gonna push your luck.
>You make it a point to stay a good distance away, just in case something fishy is going on.
>You just keep following the GPS, growing more concerned as your turns continue to match the mysterious driver's.
>Wait.  Could this car be from...
>Nah.

>As you approach the circled patch of woods, it becomes apparent that the black car is indeed going the same way.
>There's nothing else of interest in this part of town, so where else COULD they be going?
>Plus, them being from the other world would explain the unknown make and model of the car...
>You wonder what species of... otherworlder(?) is driving.  Could it be one of Connie's coworkers?  Or...

<???>

>"Uh...!  Trip, I think this guy's going our way."
>"What?  That's a human, you maroon.  There ain't no way, no how that a human is comin' to Elsewhere.  How would they even know how to get there?"
>"Uh... I dunno, but he sure is following us."
>"Hmph.  Fine, fine.  If he DOES follow us... maybe I'll have a lil chat with him when we get there."

<Anon>

>Before you know it, you arrive at your destination.  A dirt road leads into the woods, and the black car speeds down it.
>You cautiously follow their lead...
>And drive through a massive tunnel.  
>Wait.
>A tunnel?  In the middle of the woods?

>After what feels like an hour, you emerge from the tunnel...
>And onto a road you've never seen before.  As if on cue, your GPS sputters indignantly before clamming up entirely. 
>...this map doesn't cover wherever you are right now.  As much as you hate to say it, you may have to follow that car a little farther.
>You maintain a safe distance from the driver and follow them along the mysterious highway.  Signs for businesses you've never heard of flash by.
>JTZ Radio.  Deadline Auto Parts.  BHA Insurance.
>All of them sport images of people like Connie... Otherworlders, apparently.
>Your heart races when you see a sign for Elsewhere.  Unfortunately, it looks like it's gonna be quite a drive.  At least a day or two.  Sigh.
>Right on schedule, your gas light comes on.  You grumble and pull over at the first building that looks like a gas station.
>A chill runs down your spine when the black car also stops.
>As you step out to pump your gas, two people step out of the car and approach you.  It's only now that it hits you: that car was a fair deal larger than yours.
>The two individuals, clad in a black suit and a red one respectively, beeline for you.  One, a bulky fellow who seems to be an arctic fox, bumbles along with a dumbfounded expression.
>The other, a curvy red vixen in a tight fitting suit, struts as if the parking lot were a catwalk.  She eyes you fiercely, clutching a gold cigarette holder between her clawed fingers.
>Something odd strikes you... they have multiple tails.  2 and 3, respectively.  How odd.
>Well, that doesn't really matter at the moment anyway.  What DOES matter is that they're approaching fast.

>Rather than let your mounting anxiety show, you muster up a smile as the duo approach.  Once they get within earshot, you speak up.
>"Uh, hi there?  What can I do for you two?"
>The woman narrows her eyes and wordlessly extends her cigarette towards her companion.  He stares at it blankly for a moment, only for her to snap impatiently, spurring him into pulling out a lighter.
>Once her cig is lit, she takes a long drag before finally addressing you.
>"Cut the shit.  I wanna know why you're tailin' us.  Ain't no reason a human oughta be following the likes of us."
>Her voice is brisk and sharp, with a very faint, unidentifiable accent.  Her bulky companion speaks up.
>"Uh... yeah.  I dunno what you're up to, but uh... maybe you can, uh...?"
>He's clearly... a bit ditzy, to say the least.  He speaks slowly and seems to trail off between words.  The woman seems to get fed up with him, and cuts him off.
>"What my dimwit associate is TRYING to get at is: we want answers."
>Well... might as well be honest.
>"Well, I met a woman from this world.  I'm just going to Elsewhere to meet her, and it seems we're going the same way, coincidentally.  Sorry to make you think I was following you, it was unintentional."
>Again, she narrows her eyes and takes a deep breath.  She blows a massive cloud of smoke in her companion's face, and he coughs and sputters.
>"Riiiight.  Well then, Romeo, explain to me why ya nearly rode our back bumper then?"
>"It was an accident.  I wasn't paying attention to the road, I was checking my directions."
>"Uh... directions to where?"
>The woman smacks the big oaf in the back of the head.
>"To the Door, ya big nimrod."
>She shakes her head for a moment.
>"Well, anyway.  Lemme introduce myself.  Name's Trip.  This hunk of braindead meat is Dub."
>"Uh... nice to, uh... to meet ya."
>You smile again.
>"Likewise.  I'm Anon."

>"So, you two heading to Elsewhere too?"
>Trip clears her throat, giving Dub a meaningful look.
>"Yeah, as a matter of fact.  Small world."
>"Mind if I keep following?  I don't know these roads, and my GPS, uh... broke."
>She dismissively waves a hand.
>"Yeah, sure, whatever.  You seem like an alright fella."
>"Uh... yeah... feel free to let us lead the, uh..."
>Trip rolls her eyes and mimes strangling Dub.
>"Yer lucky you're cute, Dub.  If ya weren't, you'd probably be a dead man."
>"Uh...!"
>He looks at you helplessly, so you try to keep Trip talking.
>"So, uh.. w-what do you two do?"
>"Huh?  Oh.  Well, I'm lucky enough to have a pretty cushy office job."
>"Uh... and I'm da bouncer at a nightclub."
>"Oh, I see."
>"Whattabout you, Anon?  What kinda job you holdin' down?"
>"Well... I'm a window washer."
>Trip snickers a bit.
>"I thought those were just an old cartoon bit?  Eh, whatever.  Long as it puts food on the table, it's as good as any other job, right?"
>You nod with a smile.
>"My thoughts exactly.  A lot of people laugh when I tell them what I do."
>Trip has the decency to look a bit sheepish.
>"Err... sorry, pal.  Couldn't help myself."
>"It's fine, really."
>You momentarily break off the conversation to go pay for your gas.  You're surprised when Dub shoves you aside at the register.
>"Uh... lemme get this guy's gas.  He's, uh... new in town."
>The clerk, a cat, shrugs indifferently.
>"Wow, thanks, Dub."
>"Uh... don't mention it, Anon."
>With that, you head back outside.  Trip is leaning against your car, puffing away on her cigarette, tails swishing idly.

>You walk closer to the lounging vixen, and she takes her weight off your car.
>"You about ready to get movin', Dub?"
>"Uh..."
>"I'll take that as a yes.  Whattabout you, Anon?"
>"Just a minute, please."
>You've got a few questions first.
>"You called me Romeo... is there a version of that story in this world?"
>"Huh?  Whatta you talking about?  That's just an ol' turn of phrase, ain't it?"
>"Well, yes, but it's based on an old play."
>"Huh.  Well, I guess I learned somethin' today.  I just picked that sayin' up from somewhere, don't even really remember where."
>Odd...
>"I see.  Uh... do you mind if I ask what you two are doing riding together?"
>Trip narrows her eyes a bit, and her grip on her cigarette holder visibly tightens.
>"..."
>Dub speaks up.
>"Uh...!  We was going to the human world on a, uh... uh... a date."
>Trip practically snaps her cigarette holder in half, and glares at her companion.
>"Dub... he ain't gotta know our business!"
>"Uh...!  Well you wasn't saying anything!"
>She looks pretty flustered, and refuses to meet your eyes.
>...something tells you these two may be a bit shady.  You luckily brought your pocketknife, so at least you wouldn't be unarmed if things went south.
>Trip sighs.
>"Well, now that ya've aired our laundry, let's blow this popsicle stand, Dub.  Jus' follow us, Anon.  We'll getcha to Elsewhere."
>With that, the foxes hop back into their car.  They speed off, and you follow their lead.

>...after several hours of driving, it's nearly midnight.  Dub and Trip have pulled into a motel, and you followed suit.
>"Uh... this is a pretty nice, uh, place.  We stayed here, uh......"
>"We stayed here on the way to yer world, Anon."
>It does seem pretty cozy.  Not too far removed from a motel back home, really.
>You rent a room with no issues, and start getting ready for bed.  Of course, your new... friends(?) booked the room next door.  There's even a door connecting both rooms.

>As you begin to lie down, you think about Connie.
>You reminisce on your time with her, a sentimental smile spreading across your face and a bittersweet warmth flooding your heart.
>You've got to find her.  Remembering her smile, her eyes, the sheer enthusiasm she has for everything...
>It's all you need to reaffirm your goal.
>Besides that... you don't feel too comfortable in this... Otherworld without her.  The people you've met seem nice enough, but something about Dub and Trip rubs you the wrong way.
>Maybe you're just paranoid.
>You tell yourself that as you lock every door and window in your room.
>Maybe they're perfectly nice people who are just as weirded out by you as you are by them.
>You tell yourself THAT as you carefully stow away your valuables in the room safe.
>Once everything is stowed away and locked, you lay down again, feeling a little more secure.
>A dark part of your mind tells you that things are probably gonna get loud next door.  It also tells you to go listen at the door.
>...
>Well... maybe a quick listen won't hurt anyone?
>You carefully press your ear to the door...

>"...Y'know somethin'?  That was a pretty nice thing, buyin' the fella's gas."
>"Uh... it was nothin', Trip."
>"Didn't seem like nothin' to me, lover boy.  Y'know what I think?  I think yer trying to butter me up."
>"Uh..."
>"And y'know what else?"
>There's a loud, rusty squeak.
>"It's workin'."

>...maybe you should give them some privacy.
>You tell yourself that as you remain still, ear glued to the door.

>Once things start to get a bit... heated, you peel yourself from the door.  It takes a good bit of willpower, considering that the door is not at all soundproof and Trip's pretty loud.
>You slowly make your way back to bed, shaking your head in an attempt to clear your thoughts.  Which... proves pretty difficult.
>You grin a bit, wondering if she's keeping the neighbors up.
>C'mon now, get ahold of yourself.  You need to get some rest.  Dub said that they were heading out first thing tomorrow, and you don't want to drive drowsy.
>You lie down and close your eyes.  You try to think about Connie some more, anything to drown out your neighbors' escapades.
>You wonder if Connie's waiting for you.  Surely she is...
>No.  You're absolutely certain she is.  Somehow, someway, you know she can't wait for you to arrive.
>You muse out loud.
>"I wonder if I'll get there tomorrow?"
>As if on cue, you get an answer... of a sorts.
>"OH GOD, YESSSSSS!"
>...you fold the pillow up and around your ears in an attempt to drown out Trip.
>Thankfully, it seems that things are simmering down.  Before long, you finally fall asleep just as the smell of cigarette smoke wafts under the door.
>You don't dream, your mind merely relives your adventures with Connie as if anticipating your reunion.

>You awaken after a rough night's sleep to the sound of knocking on your door.
>Remember how you thought things were simmering down?  Apparently they only needed a breather.
>You shuffle over to the door and unlock it, and find Dub standing in the hallway.
>"Oh!  Uh... mornin'.  You about ready to, uh, go?"
>"Yeah, give me just about 5 minutes."
>He nods and heads off.  As soon as you close the door to the hallway, you hear a knock on the other door, the one into the foxes' room.
>Once you answer it, a far less cold Trip steps into your room.
>"Mornin', Anon.  How ya doin'?"
>"Fine, thanks.  Just gathering my stuff so we can hit the road."
>She catches you off guard with a toothy smile.
>"Take yer time, pal.  If you need help with your bags, I'll get Dub to do some liftin'."
>"Thanks, but I packed pretty light."
>She looks almost disappointed, and casts a glance out the window at her partner.
>"Well, damn. I wanted an excuse ta see him work those muscles~"
>...It's too early for this.
>"Alright, sure; he can help."
>Immediately, she grins again.  She whistles, and Dub is there in minutes.
>"Uh...?"
>"Our new friend needs you to take his stuff to his car, big man."
>He chuckles dumbly, then grabs your suitcase, along with several from their room.  Trip whistles to herself as he walks off.
>You roll your eyes and follow the bouncer to your car.  Once he loads your stuff into your trunk, Trip practically leaps onto him, wrapping her arms and legs around him.
>Dub chuckles again as he heads over to the black car.
>At least you don't have to ride with them.

>...it takes a full day's worth of driving, but you finally see the three words you've been aching to lay eyes on:
>Welcome to Elsewhere.
>Once again, your new friends lead the way to a hotel, this one a bit fancier than the last.  Trip steps out of the car.
>"Well, Anon... looks like this is where we part ways.  I'm sure your dame is around town, but I'd wait till tomorrow to find her, see?"

>"Well... it's not that late.  I think I'll go see her tonight."
>"Well, if ya insist.  Take care, pal."
>Trip waves goodbye with a smile, then turns and plants a kiss on Dub's snout.  He practically melts, chuckling stupidly.
>You exit the hotel and step out into the cool night air.  A few people of varying species wander the streets, most of them giving you confused looks.
>Where would Connie be...?
>Oh, hang on.  You could try calling her, maybe.
>She gave you her number, but said she wasn't sure if your phones would connect.
>...it's worth a shot.  You dial her up, and listen to the phone ring.
>Just when you start to give up, your heart skips a beat.
>She answers.
>"Inspector Lopine.  How can I help you?"
>"Connie?  It's me!"
>She gasps, and there's a long pause.  When she speaks again, her voice trembles.
>"A-Anon?  Is that you?"
>"It's me; I'm in Elsewhere!"
>"W- really?  Where are you?"
>"Outside the, uh... Elsewhere Inn, apparently."
>"You're only a block away from my apartment?  Wait right there, I'm coming down."
>She hangs up the phone.  Before you know it, you're practically tackled to the ground.
>Connie lifts you up and embraces you tightly, inadvertently burying your face in her cleavage.
>"I can't believe you're HERE!  I... I was going to drive back to your world tomorrow, but..."
>She trails off, merely smiling at you.  As usual, you can't see her eyes, but a few tears drip down her snout, telling you all you need to know.
>You wrap your arms around her tightly.
>"I missed you too."

>She smiles at you, trembling with happiness.
>"I can't tell you how much I missed you, Anon. It's been so lonely without you here..."
>"I know how you feel.  It was the same at my place."
>Without another word, you kiss her.  The two of you remain liplocked for a good while, only breaking apart to catch your breath.
>Connie's hat tips back a bit, showing her silvery eyes.  She quickly tips it back down, but you saw the tears of joy brimming.
>"Why don't we go to my place?  Save you the trouble of paying for a room in the hotel."
>"That sounds good... let me just grab my things from the car."
>You quickly snatch your suitcase, and pull out a few things...
>"Connie, I got you a few things."
>"What?  You didn't have to do that."
>"Yeah, I did.  You deserve them."
>You hand over the gifts, and she smiles warmly.
>"Oh?  This looks like a good movie.  And you remembered my favorites!"
>She immediately rips open the bag of jellybeans, dumping the entire contents into her mouth at once.
>Her tail swishes happily, and she grins with multicolored teeth.  You can't help but laugh, and she follows suit after swallowing all the candy.
>"What can I say?  I'm still a sweet tooth."
>"I wouldn't have it any other way."
>With that, she leads you to her apartment...
>You're not sure what exactly you expected, but this is probably pretty close.
>The apartment is practically spotless, and is decorated very sparsely.  Something does catch your eye though.
>On the wall hangs a shadowbox filled with some familiar items...
>The prizes Connie won at Looneyville.
>It warms your heart to look back on that day.  The day she said those words.
>"What do you think, Anon?"
>"I love it."
>With a smile, she echoes the very words that are on your mind.
>"Well, I love you."

>The two of you slowly drift over to the couch, Connie staring and squeezing you as if she can't believe you're real.
>Once she sits down, you take a look at the movie you bought.
>"Wanna get cozy and watch this?"
>"Ooh... that sounds nice, Anon."
>You smile and pop open the DVD case...
>Huh?  What's this?
>The case is clearly labeled "WARKILL 3: ELECTRIC BOOGALOO", and yet the disc inside is... not that.
>It's a purple disc labeled "Zoned Out".  Sounds like a cartoon or something.  Hmph.
>"Something the matter, Anon?"
>"Nah... just got the wrong movie in the case is all."
>"Well... pop it in anyway.  I just want to watch something with you.  Doesn't matter what it is."
>You agree, and start the film.
>It's... some kind of sci-fi film? At first, anyway.  It quickly becomes a romance...
>Then things go a bit beyond romance.  What strikes you though is the fact that...
>"Uh, Connie?  Aren't some of these actors..."
>"Otherworlders?  It seems so, yes.  How bizarre."
>As the movie goes on, Connie scoots as close to you as she can, cuddling up close and hugging you repeatedly.  Occasionally, perhaps accidentally, her hand occasionally brushes past your crotch.
>Is she... enjoying the steamier bits of this?  It's hard to read her expression under the hat sometimes.
>Despite the movie getting graphic at times, it's a legitimately touching romance.  Connie sniffles a few times throughout it, and you'd be lying if you said it didn't tug at your own heartstrings.
>The two of you share a loving smile and embrace again just as the credits roll.
>"Thank you for the movie, Anon."
>"You're welcome.  Thanks for watching it with me."
>She keeps smiling, then glances at the clock.
>"Oh... it's getting late.  I guess I should turn in for tonight.  Do you... want to share my bed...?"
>She hangs her head bashfully.

>"If you're okay with that, I'd be happy to."
>She hesitates for a second, then nods happily.
>"Great!  I think it should be big enough for both of us, since... you're not that big compared to me."
>She's got a fair point.
>"Let me just change into my sleepwear, and I'll join you, Connie."
>"Okay.  ...uh, there's one more thing I need to ask."
>"What's that?"
>"...is it going to make things weird if I sleep naked?"
>...
>"Nah, you're fine.  Do whatever's comfortable for you."
>She smiles and heads into her bedroom.  Once she's out of sight, you quickly change clothes.
>You make your way to the bed, where Connie is already laying, buried up to her neck in blankets.
>Her hat is laying across her face gently.
>"Ready for bed, Anon?"
>"Yep, I am."
>You lie down next to her and burrow under the covers.  Your hand brushes against her soft, warm fur...
>She giggles ever so faintly.
>"If I'm bothering you, please tell me.  I could put on some bedclothes if need be...?"
>"Don't be silly, you don't bother me.  I like your fur.  It's cozy."
>Though you can't see it under her hat and the cover of darkness, you're certain that Connie is smiling.
>She cuddles up closer to you, then sighs happily.
>"To think... I finally have you back.  It may have been only 10 days, but it felt like a lifetime.  Anon, thanks for everything.  I love you."
>"Love you too, Connie.  Thanks for everything you've done for me."
>She snuggles even closer, then yawns.

>After lying there for a while, asleep, you half wake up.  It's hot under these blankets.  You subconsciously remove your shirt and pants, then go back to cuddling as close to Connie as you can.
>You wrap an arm around her middle and hold her tight, enjoying her warmth and the pleasant plushness of her midsection.
>Her fur feels amazing against your bare skin, lulling you back to sleep.
>You're so tired from the long drive that you don't dream at all.

>...you wake up to a vast expanse of white.  Momentarily confused, you blink a few times before suddenly realizing what you're seeing:
>You somehow ended up Eye-to-Boob on Connie.  She's still asleep, hat resting across her face, judging by the snoring.
>Her arms are wrapped around you tightly, and her tail is draped over your side.  You gently adjust yourself...
>She grunts in her sleep, then rolls over, releasing her grip.  You ease out of bed just as her hat falls off her face; you carefully set it atop her dresser.
>Taking care not to wake her, you sneak into the living room.

>You cautiously make your way to the kitchen.
>Remembering how much Connie likes your cooking, you decide to make a hearty breakfast.
>Or... you want to do that, anyway.
>Seems like she hasn't been grocery shopping in a while.  Her fridge is almost barren, with only a pack of bacon, some eggs, and assorted drinks remaining.
>Ah well.  It'll do.
>You start frying up the bacon, recalling that she said she preferred hers more rare.  You don't skimp on cooking the eggs, however.  Don't wanna risk making her sick, after all.
>Despite you being as quiet as possible, you hear Connie get up.  She soon makes her way into the kitchen, yawning and sniffing the air.  She's already dressed in her coat and hat, unsurprisingly.
>"Aww, you're making breakfast on your first morning here?  Anon, you should've let me treat you, not the other way around!"
>"I don't mind at all.  Go ahead and eat, I fixed you a plate."
>She grabs the food and gasps.
>"You even remembered that I like mine less done?"
>She sets the plate down and embraces you tightly.
>"You're the best, Anon."
>She takes a seat at the table, and begins eating.  By the time your food finishes cooking, she's already cleaned her plate.
>Good to know she hasn't changed a bit in the short time you were away.
>"So, what's on the agenda today, Connie?"
>"Well... I had a meeting with my employer yesterday.  Nothing serious, thankfully, but she gave us today off while SOMEBODY goes through some training exercises."
>"Oh?"
>"Mhm.  My colleague, Bonnie, got boozed up on an assignment and caused some issues.  So, my employer is probably throwing the book at her."
>"I see.  Well, at least we have today free."
>"Exactly.  What do you want to do?  Gosh, you must have so many things on your mind, this being your first full day in Elsewhere...!"
>She smiles excitedly, tail wagging.

>"How about a tour of the city?"
>"Ooh, that could be fun.  I know some nice places we can go..."
>Connie suddenly seems to remember something.
>"Oh!  Anon, wait here."
>She dashes off and soon returns with something under her arm.
>"I got you a gift too."
>She hands it over...
>It's a cookbook titled Elsewhere's Finest Recipes.
>"Do you like it?  I know you enjoy cooking..."
>"I love it.  Thanks, Connie; maybe I can try making some of your favorites sometime."
>She smiles bashfully.
>You quickly finish up breakfast, then get ready to head out on the town.
>Once you're all set, she leads you out onto the street...

>Elsewhere is much busier in the daylight.
>People of all shapes and sizes mill about, and cars rush by constantly.  Connie beams at you.
>"What do you think?"
>"It's a pretty nice city, isn't it?"
>"I love this town.  That's why I do what I do!"
>She continues to smile, placing her hands on your shoulders.
>"There's so much to see, I don't know where to start.  What's something you'd like to see, Anon?  If you can name it, Elsewhere probably has it."
>"Is that so?"
>"Yes, this town's got all sorts of hotspots.  We're a regular metropolis!"
>Certainly seems that way.  Everywhere you look, the city spreads as far as you can see.
>You can tell this tour is gonna be an all day event.

>"So, where should we start, Anon?"
>"I... have no idea.  I wouldn't even know where to begin in a town this big."
>Connie chuckles and squeezes your shoulders gently.
>"I understand.  It's overwhelming, your first time in Elsewhere.  How about... hm.  I'm not sure where to begin myself, actually!"
>She puts a hand to her chin in thought.
>As she thinks, a rather skittish-looking calico cat approaches, looking down at some sort of PDA.  She wears a long lab coat and a tight fitting black shirt bearing the logo DDA.  Before you can say anything, she runs into Connie.
>"Oof!  Sorry, about- oh, hi, Marnie!  How are you enjoying the day off?"
>The frazzled looking feline adjusts her glasses and smiles.
>"Oh, h-hi there, Connie.  I'm d-doing okay, I guess.  Just t-trying to catch up on s-some... what is that?"
>She frowns down at you, looking over her glasses.  She looks more confused than anything.  Suddenly, comprehension dawns on her face.
>"Are you... a human?"
>You nod, and she lets out a startled laugh not unlike a normal cat yowling.
>"W-well then.  Nice to m-meet you, uh..."
>"Anon. You're... Marnie, right?"
>"A-Anon.  Yes, that's m-me, Marnie F-Felenis... I've never m-met a human before..."
>She looks and sounds rather nervous; her voice wavering uncertainly.
>Connie smiles patiently.
>"Anon, Marnie is one of my colleagues.  She handles the more technical work.  Checking phone records, security footage, that sort of thing."
>The cat nods, tail and ears fidgeting.
>"T-that's right.  I'm l-lucky to work with someone so n-n-nice..."
>Marnie smiles sheepishly, and grabs her long tail.  She quickly removes her glasses and wipes the lenses with her tail, then places them back on her nose with an awkward smile.

>"Hang on.  How do so many of you... Otherworlders know about humans?  I hadn't heard of your people until I met Connie."
>Marnie laughs nervously again.
>"We've known a-about humans for s-several years now... w-we're just f-fuzzy on the specifics.  H-heheh..."
>"...are all Otherworlders so tall?"
>"M-most of us, yes.  I-I've met a few p-people around y-your height."
>"I see.  Connie and I were gonna take a tour around town; do you have any suggestions for where to go first?"
>"O-oh... maybe... I've always liked t-the Blue Sky Tower...?  M-maybe you'd enjoy s-seeing Elsewhere f-from a birds-eye v-view."
>"That sounds pretty neat, thank you, Marnie."
>She smiles, and Connie returns the favor.
>"Good idea, Marnie; I didn't even think about the Tower.  I'm sure Anon will love it."
>"N-no problem, C-Connie.  G-glad to help..."
>She fidgets with her glasses as she trails off.

>"Well, let's get moving, Connie.  Thanks for the tip, Marnie."
>"O-oh!  Y-you're welcome... hope y-you two have f-fun."
>Connie beams at her friend.
>"Have a good day, Marnie.  Don't let those nerves get to you."
>The cat nods and smiles awkwardly, then wanders off, frowning at her PDA.
>With that, you and Connie set off for the massive Tower.
>It's a decent walk, but not unbearable.
>"So, how long has that tunnel to my world been around?"
>"Hm?  Oh, the Door?  It's been there for... a while now, I think.  Not sure exactly how long."
>"WHY is it there?"
>Connie shrugs.
>"Beats me.  It's an unsolved mystery."
>"Is the Otherworld in contact with our world?"
>"No... no, we aren't.  Some of us venture into your world, and we very rarely get humans here, but it seems that humans aren't aware of our world."
>"...could the two worlds ever fully meet?  Coexist?"
>"...I don't know.  There have been cases of Otherworlders who went into your world... and never came back.  The popular theory is that frightened humans may have... well."
>You get the gist.
>"I see.  I hope you know I'm not afraid of your people."
>Connie wraps an arm around you as you continue to walk.
>"I know, and I appreciate that."
>"In fact, it seems like some of your people are afraid of me."
>"Hm?  Oh, Marnie?  She has anxiety issues.  She wasn't afraid of you, I promise."
>"Good.  I felt kinda bad; I thought maybe I was coming off as threatening or something."
>"No, you were fine."
>She smiles at you, then carefully adjusts her hat, the wind having blown it back a bit.

>After a rather uneventful walk, you finally arrive at the Tower.
>It's... absolutely gargantuan.  Far bigger than you imagined.
>Connie smiles and gestures grandly.
>"This is the Sky Blue Tower, one of our greatest tourist attractions.  ...I'm a little embarrassed I didn't think to come here first, actually.  Anyway, you can see all of Elsewhere from up there!  It's breathtaking, even if you live here."
>"Well, let's go check it out."
>She nods and starts to enter the tower...
>Then a rogue gust of wind blows her hat off.
>Connie's silver eyes widen, and she quickly starts trying to hide her face.
>"C-catch it, Anon, please!"
>The wide brimmed hat floats lazily on the wind, and you chase after it.
>It takes quite a bit of running, but you eventually manage to reclaim the lost headwear.
>You walk back to the Tower, panting.
>Connie stands by the entrance, a hand over her face and tears running down her snout.
>"I caught it, Connie."
>She lets out a cry of happiness and snatches it from you, immediately replacing it on her head.  She sighs in relief.
>"I-I thought I'd lose it.  Thank you, Anon."
>You wordlessly embrace her, and she returns the favor, squeezing you tightly.
>Eventually, the two of you separate, with her wiping her eyes.
>"Let's... let's go inside, Anon."
>You nod, and the two of you enter the Tower.
>After buying two tickets, you board the massive elevator in the center of the Tower.
>Large windows show just how high your ride is taking you.  It's... it's a pretty long way up.
>It's a good thing you're not afraid of heights.
>You soon arrive at a large lounge at the top of the Tower.

>The lounge is rather busy, with quite a few Otherworlders of varying species hanging around.
>There are dogs, cats, rabbits...
>And two familiar foxes.
>Trip elbows Dub and waves at you, then runs over.
>"Ey!  If it isn't Anon.  And who's this fine lady?"
>Connie smiles and shakes Trip's hand.
>"I'm Connie.  Nice to meet you."
>"Trip.  Likewise.  So, YOU'RE the one ol' Anon was pinin' for, eh?  Yeah, I see it.  Glad you two was able to reunite."
>"I owe it to you guys.  If you hadn't shown me how to get here, I'd never have made it."
>"Hey, think nothin' of it.  DUB!  Get over here, ya big lug."
>The bulky fellow wanders over and grins.
>"Uh... hey there, Anon.  And, uh..."
>"Connie.  You must be Dub, right?"
>"Uh... yeah, that's me!"
>"It's nice to meet you both.  How did you two meet Anon?  Seems like you know him."
>Trip grins.
>"We helped him find Elsewhere.  He ran into us while we were coming home from some... business in the human world."
>"Well, thank you for your kindness.  I hope you know how happy you've made us."
>She beams and hugs you close; you wrap an arm around her middle.
>"Aww.  You two are 'bout as sweet as sugar, y'know that?"
>The four of you chat for a while longer, then you all meander over to the windows.
>Elsewhere is a massive, massive city.  It's positively beautiful from up here.
>So clean and well maintained, too.  Far neater than any big city you've been in.
>Connie pats you on the shoulder.
>"Well?  What do you think?"
>"What do I think?  It's gorgeous.  Thanks for bringing me up here."
>She smiles again, her tail wagging happily.
>Dub grins.
>"Uh... I've always liked this view."
>Trip nods.
>"Me too, heh."

>While your group admires the view, a thought comes to mind.
>"Hey, you guys wanna exchange numbers?  It'll be nice to keep in touch."
>"Huh?  Sure thing, pal.  It'll be nice to have some non-Dub conversations, heh."
>"Uh... hey!"
>"Just kiddin', loverboy."
>The two foxes jot down their numbers and pass them to you, and you and Connie do the same.
>"Thanks, guys.  Is there anywhere you two suggest Connie and I go next?"
>"Well, I dunno about you two, but I know where I'M headed: the bar, heh."
>"Oh, there's one here?"
>"Yep, on the other side'a the lounge.  C'mon, why don't you two join us?"
>You look to Connie, and she nods with a smile.
>"Sounds fun, Trip.  Thanks for inviting us."
>"Don't mention it, sweetheart."
>The four of you grab a table in the lounge, and you head up to the bar.
>The bartender, apparently a wolf or something similar, immediately catches you off guard.  She's clad in a blue suit...
>And has blue fur.  She grins rather maniacally.
>"Hey there, human!  What can I getcha?"
>"Uh..."

>Okay, you have to ask.
>"...what's with the blue?"
>Her smile doesn't falter at all.
>"Blue's just my color, gah-hah!  This is Sky Blue Tower, after all."
>"But how did you get blue fur?"
>"Dye.  Lots of it, too, gah-hah!"
>You begin to suspect she may be sampling her own wares...
>"Alright then... uh, what do you recommend?"
>She puts a hand to her chin, smile fading slightly.
>"Hmm.  For you... tell ya what.  I'll make you my signature drink: the Golden Apple.  Sound good?"
>"Uh... what is it, exactly?"
>She chuckles.
>"It's a secret recipe!  But, if ya don't trust me, I can just give you something out of the tap..."
>Surely a bartender in a public place wouldn't poison you...?
>"Okay, I'll bite."
>Her grin widens to a frankly worrying degree.
>"Great!  Gimme a minute..."
>She ducks beneath the counter, and returns with several bottles.  She deftly mixes the contents of them, eventually producing a drink with a deep blue hue.
>"Viola!"
>"...I thought it was called the Golden Apple?  This isn't gold..."
>"That's part of the surprise, gah-hah!  Hope you enjoy, human.  Lemme know if you want another."
>"Okay, thanks.  What do I owe you?"
>She scoffs and waves a hand dismissively.
>"It's on the house.  Welcome to Elsewhere."
>You shrug and make your way back to your table.  Connie smiles warmly at you.
>"That's an... interesting drink.  What is it?"
>"A Golden Apple, apparently?"
>"Hm.  Well, I hope it's good."
>So do you.

>...you're torn.  This drink does look rather ominous...
>But also oddly inviting?  You glance back over at the bartender, who is now grinning at another patron.
>"...Connie, do you suppose this is safe to drink?  That bartender is giving me weird vibes..."
>Connie leans in and inspects the drink.
>"...seems safe to me.  I doubt she'd try anything funny in a public place anyway."
>That's good enough for you.  You take a sip...
>...the flavor is nearly indescribable.
>You can only think that it tastes... chaotic.  A ton of different flavors combine in frankly bizarre ways.
>It's not at all unpleasant, though.  
>A grin spreads across your face, and you see the bartender fist pump triumphantly out of the corner of your eye.
>Connie smiles.
>"I guess it's good, then?"
>You nod and slide your glass over to her.  She hesitates, then takes a drink.
>"Ooh... this is weird.  I kind of like it, though?  I may have to get one of these."
>Trip and Dub eye up the drink as well.
>"Huh.  I come here all the time, and I ain't seen one of them before."
>"Uh... I have..."
>"Huh?  When've you seen a drink like that?"
>"I, uh... that bartender worked at the same club I do for a while."
>"Oh.  Well, that explains it.  She ain't been here long."
>Connie politely excuses herself, then returns with her own drink.
>"...I can see what you meant about the bartender.  She seems a bit out there."
>She shrugs and takes a sip of her drink.  You take another swig of yours as well.
>Trip and Dub eventually head over and get their own drinks, both of them eyeing the blue concoction curiously.

>After several trips to the bar, you're having quite a nice time.
>You vaguely wonder how much alcohol is in just one of those Golden Apples...
>No matter how many times you go back, the bartender continues to grin and mix up the same blue concoction.
>Eventually, you and your companions are all pretty tipsy.  
>Dub chuckles about nothing in particular.
>Trip seems to get sentimental.
>"I remember the foist time I laid eyes on my Dub..."
>You tune her reminiscing out, occasionally smiling and nodding when appropriate.
>Connie is the only one of you who seems to have any of her usual composure.  Though you can't help but notice her relaxing a bit more than earlier.
>You yourself try to keep things together, but...
>Connie's sitting close enough that you get a little handsy.  She doesn't really seem to mind too much, surprisingly.
>She does, however, pointedly stop you when you grab a tit.  She doesn't seem mad, she just grabs your hand and gently lays it across your lap.
>She smiles lazily.
>"I'm glad we came here.  I'm enjoying this more than I expected to.  A nice view, some new friends, some nice drinks... and you, Anon."
>She squeezes you tightly, unintentionally(?) pressing your face against her bust.
>When she lets you go, you stand up and make your way to the bar again.
>The blue-furred bartender still smiles, though this time she narrows her eyes.
>"Hey, I don't wanna ruin the fun... but I think you guys have had enough.  No offense, and you're not causing any problems, I'm just sayin'."
>You shrug.
>"Alright.  Thanks anyway, lady."
>"My pleasure, human.  Glad you four seem to have enjoyed my little concoction, gah-hah!"
>"Oh, and it's Anon."
>"Alright then; my pleasure, Anon."
>She bows deeply, smile never fading, and you head back to your table.

>When you sit back down, a burning question strikes.
>"How'd you guys meet, anyway, Trip?"
>She smiles wistfully, swirling the remnants of her last drink around in its glass.
>"Well, ta answer your question, we met on the job.  I went ta his club and showed some leg, and the rest is history..."
>The bouncer grins and nods.
>"Uh... then we, uh... worked together for a while..."
>"In the same office?  The same club?"
>His eyes widen a bit.
>"Uh... not... really."
>Trip frowns, still swirling her drink.  She downs the rest of it in one swig.
>"Look, I ain't gonna lie to ya; Me and Dub were into some serious shit a few years ago.  But we ain't like that anymore.  We went clean, see?  Legit.  We're on the level now, and happy there."
>"Oh, that's good.  Hey, you guys wanna sing a drinking song to celebrate?  I know a good one, jus' follow my lead."
>You hop onto the table and wave your arms like a deranged conductor.
>"A-one, a-two, a-one-two-three-fo-"

>You wake up to another faceful of red furred cleavage.  Your head is swimming, but you smile anyway, enjoying the view of Connie's-
>Wait.
>Connie's fur is white.
>You slowly raise up slightly, and your heart skips a beat.
>You have no idea what led to it, but somehow you and all three of your companions have ended up in the same bed.
>Luckily none of them seem to have woken up yet.
>UNluckily... your clothes are on the opposite side of the room, and you're sandwiched tightly between both Connie and Trip's ample racks.
>The vixen's three tails are draped over your side, and Connie's hat is for once not over her face.

>You desperately try to remember what happened.  No dice.  The last thing that comes to mind was your attempt to start a drinking song.
>You remember looks of sheer horror on the other patrons' faces, grins on your companions'...
>And a guffaw of glee from some unknown source.
>After that, your memory is blank.
>Despite being groggy, you're lucid enough to know that this is a very sensitive situation.  You carefully reach back and try to wake Connie up.
>Eventually, she grunts, then gasps.  She whispers.
>"W-what the?  Anon?"
>"Shhh... Connie, I'm sorry.  I have no idea what happened here.  The last thing I remember is trying to lead a drinking song."
>She half smiles.
>"You remember singing?  The last thing I remember is you asking Trip how she met Dub."
>She carefully rises out of bed, then realizes she's sans hat... and coat.
>Connie quickly covers her chest and face, then gingerly sneaks over to her clothes.  When she's dressed, you start to sneak out of the bed...
>With a grunt, Trip unconsciously throws an arm around you, hugging you tightly.  A smile spreads across her snout.  She mutters in her sleep.
>"There ya are, Dub..."
>You helplessly look over at Connie, who claps a hand over her mouth in horror.
>You mouth "what do I do?"
>She cringes, and eventually whispers:
>"I don't know; just... hang in there.  Maybe she'll let go."
>Your unwitting captor squeezes you tightly, smile lingering on her face.

>You should be trying to figure out how to escape, but...
>You're so sleepy...
>You start to doze off again, when it hits you: where's Dub, exactly?
>You mouth that question to Connie.
>"He's behind Trip.  Still asleep."
>...hang on.
>Did you... did you do what you think you did...?
>If so...
>Did Dub and Connie...?
>You start to get frustrated with your inability to remember anything.
>Connie frowns and puts a hand to her chin.  Suddenly, she seems to get an idea.
>She steps forward and yanks on one of Trip's tails.  She snarls in her sleep and releases you, swinging a fist towards Connie.
>You immediately take the opportunity to roll out of bed.
>You note with some relief that you're still in your briefs, at the very least.
>Maybe nothing happened after all?
>You quickly get dressed, and Connie leads you into the living room.
>Once there, the both of you sigh in relief.
>A note sits on the table, written in blue ink.
>"Wow, you guys sure can party!  You all sang so loud you ran everyone off.  Then, the wolf lady (didn't get your name, sorry!) asked me to walk you guys home.  Please drink responsibly next time, gah-hah! -C"
>The handwriting is frankly garbage, with the signature letter being almost illegible.
>Connie huffs and shrugs.
>"I don't remember that, but I suppose it must've happened."
>You grimace.
>"Do you think anything... happened?"
>"...I don't think so, no."
>"Phew.  Me neither.  I still had my briefs on."
>...you really hope nothing happened.  You wouldn't dream of betraying Connie like that.

>Awkward as it is... you'd rather be sure that nothing happened.
>You blush and cough in embarrassment.
>"Uh... C-Connie... I'm gonna check and make sure nothing happened.  You... you may wanna do the same?"
>She pulls her hat firmly over her eyes, then nods slightly.
>With that, you head into the bathroom and disrobe.
>You're relieved to find no sign of red fur...
>And a bit disappointed to find no signs of white fur either.
>Oh well.  At least nothing happened with you and Trip, apparently.
>You exit the bathroom, and Connie looks over at you.  You smile.
>"All clear."
>She grins slightly, then passes you and heads into the bathroom herself.
>After an agonizing wait, she steps back out with a relieved sigh.
>"All clear here."
>With that, the two of you embrace, crisis apparently averted.
>"Phew.  Sorry about all this, Connie."
>"Not your fault.  It's all fine anyway.  Nothing happened."
>...wait.
>"Hold on.  They're still asleep in there.  What are we gonna do about that?"
>"...hm.  I guess just... leave them alone?"
>Sounds good to you.

>"...where are we, anyway?"
>Connie frowns and examines your surroundings.
>"...I thought this was my apartment, but it's too... disorganized."
>You investigate a bit, and find some conclusive evidence:
>A framed photo of Trip and Dub, smiling and embracing.
>"This must be one of their places."
>Connie nods.
>"Question is: which one, and where exactly IS it?"
>You continue to investigate a bit...
>Upon coming across a black fedora, you conclude that this is Dub's apartment.
>That explains why it's kinda messy and cluttered.  He doesn't seem the type to keep things clean.
>As for where exactly it's located...
>"Okay, from what I can see out the window... I think we're on the other side of town from my apartment.  ...I thought the note said that the bartender walked us home, and that it was my idea?  Maybe Trip chimed in or something."
>Connie frowns and rubs the back of her head.
>"I don't like forgetting stuff like this.  Remind me not to deal with blue bartenders again."
>"Same here."
>"...should we just... leave?"

>Before you can give an answer, the door to the bedroom opens up.  Trip staggers out, rubbing her forehead and clad only in her bra and panties.
>"...the hell happened last n-"
>She blinks in shock at seeing you, then hastily wraps her tails around herself.
>"W-what the...?  Anon?  Connie?"
>You both nod.
>"...how much did I drink last night?"
>Connie smiles sympathetically.
>"I'm not sure, but we all blacked out, apparently.  What's the last thing you remember, Trip?"
>The fox frowns, rubbing her temples.
>"Uh... Anon hopped up on the table and started singing... everyone got up and left but us... Dub hit on the bartender and I knocked one'a her teeth out, I think...?"
>Connie blinks a few times at the last bit, and Trip grins.
>"Gotcha.  Nah, the last thing I remember is tellin' the blue dame how to get ta Dub's place.  Seemed like a good idea at the time."
>"I see.  Well, uh... we can go, if you want."
>The fox scoffs.
>"C'mon now.  We're friends here, ain't we?  Make yourselves cozy.  I'll go wake the big bum up and we'll have breakfast."
>Trip heads back into the bedroom. After a while, she and Dub emerge, fully dressed.  He looks rather alarmed.
>"Uh...!  I remember, uh... I hugged Connie and, uh... may have copped a feel.  Sorry 'bout that..."
>The shewolf clears her throat, but smiles.
>"Thanks for the apology Dub.  I appreciate it.  Is that the last thing you remember?"
>"Uh... no.  The blue dame asked me for a pen... then I uh... passed out."
>"Hm.  So if we string it all together... we chased everyone out of the lounge by singing, I asked the bartender to walk us home, Trip gave her directions to Dub's apartment, and Dub gave her a pen to write this note with.  And now, here we are."
>Trip whistles.
>"Whoa, you some kinda detective or somethin'?"
>Connie beams.
>"Yes, I am."
>"Huh.  Well, good for you!  I shoulda guessed by the getup, heh."
>The two ladies smile at one another, and Dub grins and tips his hat at you.

>Trip grins for a little while longer, then clears her throat.
>"Eh, anyway... howzabout I fix us some breakfast?  You guys hungry?"
>You and Connie nod politely, and Dub speaks up.
>"Uh... I'm starvin', Trip."
>She smiles and chuckles.
>"I'm sure ya are, you big goon."
>She motions for everyone to follow her, then heads into the kitchen.
>It's a mess in here.  Does Dub ever clean anything up?
>Despite the total lack of organization, Trip deftly maneuvers about the kitchen, throwing together a decent breakfast.
>She whistles a jazzy tune as she does so, and Dub taps his claws on the table rhythmically.
>"So, Connie; yer a detective, huh?"
>"Yes, I am; I work at Drakewing Detective Agency."
>"Ohh!  DDA's a pretty classy joint, ain't it?"
>"Well..."
>The vixen holds up a hand.
>"Don't worry about it, heh.  I know what that 'well' means."
>"Uh... you don't happen ta know a fella named, uh......"
>Dub seems to lose his train of thought, much to Trip's frustration.
>"A fella named what, Dub?  Now ya got me curious."
>"Uh... it ended with an O....?"
>Trip drops a fork she was carrying.
>"...Dub.  Are you talkin' about Uno?"
>He grins and nods.
>"Yeah!  That's it, uh... Uno!"
>Connie frowns a bit.
>"Yes, I've dealt with him a few times before... why do you ask?"
>...you don't like where this is going.

>"Who's Uno?"
>Connie continues to frown.
>"...he's an infamous conman who's been operating in Elsewhere for a few years now.  I just busted one of his scams the other day.  What I want to know is: how do you two know him?"
>Trip looks a bit nervous, but Dub doesn't seem to pick up on Connie's attitude.
>"Uh... we used ta work with Uno, right, Trip?"
>The three-tailed vixen glares at her boyfriend, then sighs.
>"Welp, seeing as ol' two-tail can't keep his yap shut, I can't exactly deny it.  Yeah, we used ta work with the lil slimeball."
>"...please, go on."
>"...Connie.  I wanna level with you again.  Me and Dub?  We're clean now.  We cut ties with the likes'a Uno.  Last time I talked to the lil' jerk was probably... 3 or 4 years ago."
>Connie continues to sit silently, hat obscuring her eyes.
>"...Look, I don't know what else you wanna hear.  We worked with some bad people.  We did some bad shit.  We got sick of it, so we went legit.  That's it, end of story, capiche?"
>Connie slowly rises from her chair, face unreadable.
>"...ya... ya ain't mad, are ya...?"
>The white wolf silently approaches Trip, who starts to look increasingly concerned.
>"...Connie?  Y-yer starting to worry me here."
>Upon reaching Trip, Connie suddenly embraces her.  The vixen lets out a shocked squawk.
>"...it's so refreshing to hear that someone in your position went clean, Trip.  It's usually the opposite, sadly.  Someone who once followed the law... falling into criminal activity."
>Trip smiles genuinely, and wraps her arms around the detective.
>"Thanks.  That's, ah... that's really nice of you to be so... acceptin'.  A lotta folks treat us a bit different when they hear about our past."
>"I wouldn't do that to you two.  You've given me no reason to."
>Trip looks over at you.
>"Whattabout you, Anon?"

>"I'll be honest.  I would probably have never found Elsewhere without you guys.  You've been nothing but nice to me, and patient too.  I consider you guys my friends, and your past changes nothing."
>Trip smiles, a few tears welling up in her eyes.
>"...thank you.  Anon, I hope ya know we consider you a friend too.  Connie, same fer you.  You guys?  Yer alright.  Yer good people."
>Dub nods in agreement.
>"Uh... yeah.  Everything she said."
>Connie releases Trip, and returns to her seat.
>You wipe a little sweat from your brow.
>...why didn't Connie just say that from the table?  You thought she was about to cuff someone.
>Oh well.
>Trip returns to her cooking, and is soon whistling again.
>Eventually, she serves up breakfast.
>"There ya go; hope you like it."
>You glance at the food on your plate.  Seems to be homemade pancakes?  Trip probably had to cobble the batter together from whatever ingredients Dub had handy.
>They...
>They're pretty ugly looking, if you're honest.
>But, you don't want to be rude to your hostess!
>You take a bite...
>...
>They're... good?  Much better than the uneven, lumpy appearance suggested.
>You smile and nod, and Trip grins again.
>"Ha!  I still got it."
>You turn to see that Connie has already cleaned her plate, true to form.
>She smiles sheepishly.

>After finishing your own plate, you smile at your new friends.
>"Thanks for the breakfast, guys."
>"No problem, Anon.  Thanks fer hangin' with us, even after learnin' about... our old job.  ...and, ah... after whatever the hell happened last night."
>You stand up and hug Trip.  Dub laughs and joins in.
>"Uh... yer welcome back whenever, Anon.  Yer alright!  Same, uh... with you, Connie."
>The wolf hops up and joins the group hug.  Trip quietly wraps one of her tails around each of you.
>"Heheh.  It ain't every day ya make new pals like you two.  C'mon back whenever, we'll paint the town red."
>The group hug continues for a while, then you all awkwardly break apart, smiling.
>You and Connie bid the foxes farewell, then make your way out of Dub's place.
>As you exit his apartment complex, Connie smiles, a hand to her chin.
>"You know what, Anon?  They seem like legitimately good people, even considering that they used to work with the likes of Uno."
>"I agree.  You can't always judge someone by their past."
>Connie wraps an arm around you as you continue to walk.
>"Let's head back to my apartment.  I'm sure you want to get cleaned up, right?"
>"Yeah, actually.  That sounds nice."
>Connie nods, then starts leading the way back to her place.

>As the two of you walk, you chat about your new friends, not really paying attention to where you're going.
>Eventually, you bump into someone, literally.
>Whoever it is, they let out a sharp yowl.
>"Oh, sorry about that!  Are you okay?"
>You look up...
>And your heart skips a beat.
>Standing before you, his arms around a gray, fluffy cat woman...
>Is a human.
>He seems a bit... out of it.  The cat speaks up.
>"Oh, sorry, sir.  I wasn't paying attention to where I was going."
>She gently hugs her companion close, burying his face in her fur.  Not difficult, seeing as she's actually nearly his height.  He closes his eyes for a moment, and staggers, then seems to snap back to reality.
>Hm.
>Connie's jaw drops.
>"Are you... actually human?"
>The dazed fellow nods.
>"Mhm... I am."
>The cat smiles at him rather... suggestively.
>"Where are my manners?  I'm Alyssa.  This is my husband, Anon."
>You and Connie share a look, then speak in unison.
>"HUSBAND?"
>Alyssa smiles, again hugging the man.
>"Yes, husband."
>Connie stammers.
>"I-I've never... I've never seen a human/Otherworlder marriage before.  N-not that there's anything wrong with it! "
>Alyssa smiles serenely, then casually buries her Anon's face in her fur again.
>"You two seem to be nice people.  Are you dating?"
>Connie pulls her hat down sheepishly, and you blush.  The cat chuckles.
>"I see.  Well, if you don't mind my asking, what are your names?"
>"I'm Connie."
>"I'm Anon."
>She beams at her husband.
>"Did you hear that, honey?  Anon must be a common name in your world.  For the sake of avoiding confusion... you can call my husband Aster."
>The man nods drowsily, then seems to slip into unconsciousness, much to you and Connie's concern.
>"M-Ma'am?  Is he alright?"
>Alyssa chuckles and gently picks her husband up.
>"He's fine, thank you.  Just needs to sit down for a moment."
>"Well... you two are welcome to come to my apartment."
>The cat smiles, and you set off on your way.

>Soon, you make it to Connie's apartment.  Alyssa gently lays Aster on the couch, smiling at him lovingly.
>...what a strange situation.  How is she so calm?
>"Are you sure he's alright, Alyssa?"
>"Mhm~  He's fine.  He'll wake up soon enough.  Thank you for the concern, though."
>Connie looks over him with a frown.
>"What... happened?"
>"My Aster has a... condition.  It's nothing major, but it is rather rare.  We've learned how to deal with it, thankfully~"
>As if on cue, the human wakes up.  He blinks a few times, then sits up, looking around.
>"Mm...?  Where are we?"
>Alyssa immediately sits beside him, wrapping her tail around him.
>"We're in miss Connie's apartment, honey.  You... had an episode again~"
>For some reason, he smiles at this, then rises up from the couch.
>He shakes your hand, then Connie's.
>"Sorry I was a bit out of sorts earlier.  Thank you for letting us crash here for a little bit."
>Connie smiles, a bit confused.
>"It's no trouble.  I hope you're feeling better?"
>"Mm?  Oh, I'm fine, really."
>"...well, you and Alyssa are welcome to stay here if you want."
>The cat smiles, then walks over, embracing her husband.
>"Why, that's very kind of you, Connie.  I don't suppose it'd hurt to stay a while and chat, would it, honey~?"
>"Of course not, dear."
>With that, they sit back down, with Alyssa occasionally flicking her tail right in Aster's face.  Not that he seems to mind...

>Well, you were kinda looking forward to a nice hot shower, but...
>Now you've got this... lovely couple(?) to talk to.
>Oh well.  Might as well try to make small talk.
>"So... how'd you two meet?"
>Aster smiles wistfully, Alyssa's tail wrapped around his head.
>"Well, I was working some dead-end job in a rough city.  I hated it there.  Then, one day... Alyssa stepped in.  Oh, it was love at first sight..."
>"Mhm... I've been just wild about him ever since~"
>Once again, she yanks him close, practically smothering him in her long fur.
>"How do you like living here in Elsewhere?"
>"Let me tell you something: the Otherworld is much more enjoyable to live in than our world.  I wouldn't go back if you payed me."
>Alyssa beams.
>"I'm so happy my honey loves it here.  It's such a nice town, don't you agree, Connie?"
>"Yes, I love Elsewhere."
>The cat woman chuckles, just as Aster nearly passes out again.
>"You sure you're alright, pal?"
>"Oh yeah, I'm fine.  Just kinda tired from work, and I of course have a condition..."
>"Understandable."
>He grins.
>"Sorry to make you folks worry.  That seems to happen a lot when I'm around, ha."
>"Well, as long as you're alright, I guess."
>...something about this situation just feels weird.  Maybe it's the fact that Alyssa has practically been giving her husband bedroom eyes the entire time?
>Or is it their apparent disregard for what's apparently a rare medical issue?
>They seem nice... but odd.

>...curiosity gets the better of you.
>"So, uh... if you don't mind me asking, what kind of condition do you have, Aster?"
>The man grimaces a bit, then smiles as Alyssa chuckles.
>"It's a rare genetic disorder... more of a quirk, really.  My Aster has an unusual sense of smell; it affects him rather strangely at times."
>"Okay... what's with the blackouts?"
>Again, the fellow cringes, only for his wife to laugh nonchalantly.
>"Sometimes particularly strong scents simply... overwhelm him~"
>You have no idea how a woman can make describing a rare genetic disorder sound seductive, but...
>Alyssa says practically everything with a coat of honey, it seems.
>"Does it... hurt to pass out like that?"
>Again, she answers for him.
>"Not at all~  He simply has to lie down for a moment while he regains his senses.  Perfectly harmless~"
>"Okay then... glad it's not serious."
>"Aren't we all~?"
>She gently wraps her tail around Aster, then leans her weight on him. He chuckles warmly.
>"Say, Anon, Connie; thank you for letting me and my sweet Alyssa hang out for a minute.  It's... it's kinda neat to see an actual human in Elsewhere."
>"Likewise, Aster."
>He nods vaguely, then leans against his wife.

>"Say, how about we exchange numbers?  It'd be nice to keep in touch."
>Alyssa nods.
>"That sounds nice~  Perhaps we'll go out for dinner sometime."
>You quickly exchange numbers with the couple.  Once you do, they rise from Connie's couch.
>"Well, it's been fun, but me and Alyssa are gonna head out.  Nice to meet you guys."
>Connie smiles.
>"You two take care."
>...a thought hits you.
>"Mind if I ask what you guys are doing?"
>"Mm, not at all~  We were heading to see a movie.  Would you two like to join us?"
>Connie seems surprised.
>"Oh?  W-well... Anon, what do you say?"
>"Uh... what movie is it?"
>"It's... some romance film... honey, do you remember what it's called?  I'm drawing a blank."
>"...uh... I think it was called... bah, I don't remember either, dear."
>"Hmph."
>Alyssa actually frowns for the first time, and flicks her tail more roughly in Aster's face.
>"What was it...?"
>Connie interjects.
>"Was it... Heart of the West?"
>The couple both immediately perk up.
>"Yeah, that's it!  Thanks, Connie."
>"Mhm... I think it looks rather promising~"
>You look over at Connie, and she shrugs before mouthing:
>"Up to you."

>You shrug.
>"That sounds fun.  We'll meet you guys there in a bit."
>Alyssa beams at her husband, squeezing him tightly.
>"Did you hear that, honey?  Our new friends are coming along!"
>He nods and mutters a response, then the couple bid you farewell.
>Once they leave, Connie chuckles a bit.
>"What an odd pair."
>"No kidding."
>"Oh well.  I have to say... them being married took me by surprise."
>"Same here; I didn't even expect a human here, much less a cross-world marriage."
>You and Connie share a smile, then she suddenly clears her throat.
>"Anyway... I suppose we'd better get cleaned up and ready to go.  The movie starts soon, I think... the theatre usually shows new movies about this time."
>With that, she dashes into the bathroom.  You hear the shower turn on, so you take a seat on the couch.
>As you wait, something catches your attention...
>Connie is singing quietly.
>You can't make out the words, but she seems to be enjoying herself in there.  You smile and just listen until she emerges, clean and clad in her usual getup.
>"Nice singing."
>"W-what singing?  I don't know what you're talking about..."
>She grins sheepishly, pulling her hat down.
>"Uh-huh.  Suuuure."
>She continues to grin, then laughs.
>"Okay, okay.  I heard it on the radio the other day and can't get it out of my head."
>"You were doing great."
>It's amazing how you can tell when she's blushing under that fur and hat.
>With that, you quickly get ready to head out.
>Once you're all set, you and Connie set out for the theatre.

>As you walk to the theatre, you and Connie chat.
>"What's this supposed to be about anyway?"
>"Ah... I think it's supposed to be one of those 'based on a true story' romance things.  Something about a human and an Otherworlder meeting back in the western days?  I don't know how historically accurate that is, myself."
>You shrug.

>Before long, you arrive at the theatre.  Alyssa and Aster are already waiting in the lobby.
>She takes notice of you, and smiles.
>"Oh, there you are!  We already bought our tickets... we'll see you inside~"
>With that, the happy couple head into the theatre proper.
>You and Connie head up and get your tickets.  The cashier, a spritely fennec fox, seems awestruck.
>"Whoa!  Two interworld couples in one day?  Sick!  Guess I still got it, huh?"
>"...got what?"
>She winks.
>"They don't call me Lucky for nothing!"
>She turns to grab your tickets, and you're caught off guard by the sight of no less than 7 tails.  She turns back and hands you your tickets, grinning.
>"Have fun, guys."
>With that, you grab two popcorns and head into the movie.
>Alyssa and Aster saved you two seats, so you pile in next to your new friends.
>You've missed some previews, but the movie itself hasn't started yet, thankfully.
>You idly look around the theatre...
>There are several couples spread around, and a few single people.
>Everyone is fixated on the screen, as is expected.
>Oh well.
>Eventually, the movie itself begins...
>"Tencor Films presents... HEART OF THE WEST"
>Unsurprisingly, the "human" lead is played by an Otherworlder...
>More specifically, a hairless cat.
>Blech.

>Well... you can't really blame the Otherworlders for not having a human actor handy.  Seems your kind are rare here.
>You quickly grow bored of the movie.
>The faux southern accents are just too much.  You can't get into this.
>You glance over at your companions...
>Connie is obviously invested, watching intently and occasionally mouthing the female lead's lines.
>Alyssa seems far more concerned with Aster than with the film.  She practically sits on top of him, stroking his hair and smiling lovingly.
>He seems rather interested in the movie, surprisingly.
>You roll your eyes and look back to the screen.
>It's apparently supposed to be a cold night.
>"Why, Stranger, ain't ya cold with no fur?"
>Subconsciously, apparently, Connie scoots close to you.
>She then yanks you into a tight, warm embrace.
>You wonder with a smile if she's concerned about YOUR lack of fur.
>As if answering your unasked question, she pulls you even closer, wrapping her arms around you tightly.
>Not that you mind.
>You're not too invested in this movie, might as well enjoy something.
>You hug Connie back, squeezing her.  She smiles, but continues to watch the movie.
>...making sure your friends aren't watching, you quickly slip a hand under Connie's rear.
>She lets out a little yelp, then tears herself away from the movie.
>"A-Anon!  That's not very... uh... nevermind."
>She trails off with a sheepish smile, then goes back to the movie.
>You can't help but chuckle...
>Then gasp when she pulls your own stunt on you.

>It seems you've started a little war.
>Throughout the rest of the movie, you and Connie keep teasing one another.
>At first, it's nothing major.  You cop a feel every now and again, she retaliates.  She leans over and kisses you on the cheek; you run a hand along her side.
>Before long, though...
>Connie is no longer paying attention to the movie.
>An almost predatory smile spreads across her face as she becomes considerably less subtle.
>The movie brings up the Stranger's lack of fur again; she pulls you close, "accidentally" burying your face in her chest.
>She reaches over, ostensibly to hold your hand, and "incidentally" brushes against your crotch.
>For your part, you also get more overt.
>When you hug her close, you quickly plant a kiss on the end of her snout.
>You "accidentally" grab a handful of tit.
>By the time the movie's nearly over, the two of you are practically pawing at each other.
>Somehow, someway, Alyssa and Aster don't seem to notice, nor particularly care.
>Good.  More fun for you.
>Things eventually hit their peak when Connie completely catches you off guard...
>She grins again, then slips a hand down your pants.
>Just as soon as she's in, she retracts her hand.  But, it's enough to get your motor running.
>You casually adjust your wardrobe as she pointedly licks her fingers.

>After that little display on Connie's part, you decide to get a bit more... overt in your affections.
>Making sure your companions aren't watching, you wink at Connie...
>Then manage to work your hand up and under her coat.  As soon as your hand gets south, she lets off a little squeal.
>You flinch, but apparently Alyssa is deaf or not paying attention.
>Wait.
>Judging by how far her tongue is down Aster's throat, it's safe to say she's preoccupied.
>So, you begin to tease Connie in earnest.  She squirms in her seat, trying to maintain her composure.
>Unfortunately for her, her light panting gives her away.
>Her hat slips backwards a bit as she lightly bucks her hips.
>Her silvery eyes are nearly glazed over with desire, no longer paying any mind to the movie.
>She doesn't even seem to pay any attention to her eyes being visible.
>Her tongue gently flops out of the corner of her mouth as you deftly maneuver your fingers.  
>You feel her tense up considerably...
>Then she suddenly seems to snap back into lucidity.
>She hastily adjusts her hat, then gently but firmly lays your hand back across your own lap.
>Connie bites her lip for a moment, then sighs in relief.
>With a smile, she pulls you into a proper kiss.
>So much for a boring movie.

>With a sly grin, you catch Connie completely off guard by scooting her onto your lap.
>It's... not easy, considering her size and weight.
>Once she's there, you put both hands to use.  One heads back down beneath her coat, the other stays up at her chest.
>You carefully slide your hand into her coat and down to her breasts.
>You note with a chuckle that something you've suspected for a while is indeed true: she doesn't wear a bra.
>You gently run your hand along a furry mound, letting the fingers on your other hand tease her womanhood.
>Before long, your hand meets a stiffening nipple; you gently brush your fingers along it, and Connie jolts upright.
>She trembles gently, tongue again flopping out and hat slipping off.
>Before you can react, her hat falls off entirely, landing atop your head.  Her long ears, freed from their confines, twitch wildly.  Her long, white hair cascades down her back.
>Her eyes glint in the light from the screen.
>Connie attempts to say something through her arousal, but succeeds only in breathless moaning.
>She thrusts a shaking hand down your pants, fumbling for your member.
>Before long, the two of you are on the razor's edge...
>Then, the credits start to roll.
>Oh shit.
>You quickly retract your hands, prompting a pitiful whine from Connie.  When she realizes what's happening, she gasps and pulls her own hand back.  
>She makes her way back to her seat, then replaces her hat just as Alyssa pulls herself away from Aster.
>Phew.
>"Well?  Did you two enjoy the movie?"
>Connie nods, still trembling and struggling for words.
>You manage to get out a "yes", and that seems to satisfy the cat.
>With that, you leave the theatre after bidding your friends farewell.
>As soon as you have some privacy, you plant one hand on Connie's rear.  Her tail swishes madly through the air, and a worryingly hungry grin lurks beneath her hat brim.

>Luckily, Connie's apartment isn't far from the theatre.  You make it there rather quickly.
>Quickly enough that she hasn't even lost her toothy smile.
>Once the door is safely closed and locked, she turns to you.
>Gone is her quiet, polite tone.  Instead, Connie speaks with a suggestive voice that would make even Alyssa blush.
>"That wasn't very professional of you, not even finishing what you started~"
>She licks her lips and advances on you.  Once she gets close, she immediately sweeps you off your feet and carries you bodily to her bedroom.
>Once there, she dumps you into the soft mattress.  With one fluid movement, Connie flings her coat off, leaving her in nothing but her hat and that snowy white fur.
>You don't have to be told what to do next.  You quickly undress as she watches with relish.
>As soon as you discard the last bit of clothing, she literally pounces on you, pinning you down.
>The sheer softness of her fur, the weight and warmth of her body...
>It's enough to get you all ready for what you know is next.
>Connie takes the initiative, climbing upwards and laying her weighty, voluminous chest across yours.
>Beneath her hat, you see her eyes, burning with silver intensity.  She stares, simply resting herself atop you...
>Then she leans in.
>"Well?  I'm yours~"
>She winks and kisses you passionately.
>Your hands roam all over her back, eventually finding purchase on her plush ass.  You gently grab two handfuls and squeeze, prompting a moan to escape her lips.
>She breaks off the kiss, raising up a bit, then again repositions herself...
>Then lowers her weighty breasts directly onto your face.

>To her apparent delight, you take advantage of your position by burying your face even deeper in her chest.
>She pants quietly for a moment, then eventually lets her breathing get louder, more intense.
>You hear her chuckle a bit as she slowly slides back down your body.  She winks and teasingly drags her tongue along your face as she goes.
>Once she's satisfied with her position, Connie wraps her arms and legs around you before grinding herself against you.
>She sinks into a slow, tantalizing rhythm, letting her eyes meet yours in a white hot gaze.
>Her careful rhythm has you aching for release, but she seems determined to pace herself, enjoying the look on your face.
>Sensing a window of opportunity, you suddenly yank her hat down over her eyes.  She growls playfully as she lets her guard down...
>Allowing you to turn the tables.  You flip her over and scramble on top of the Amazonian shewolf.
>Once on her back, Connie struggles to fix her hat.  Eventually, she manages to reveal her eyes, carrying a look of exaggerated anger.  She winks and snarls playfully.
>Now that you are firmly on top, you take charge.
>You begin deeply massaging her tits, eliciting deep moans and panting.
>Eventually, you back off, with Connie letting out a pitiable whimper.
>You then arrange yourself so that you could easily penetrate her...
>But rather than do so, you simply tease her.  You carefully prod around her slit, with her watching with bated breath.
>Through her panting, she whines.
>"P-please..."
>As if by fate, her hat falls off once more, exposing every bit of her pleading face.

>You've kept her waiting long enough.  You meet her gaze, watching her whine out one last plea.
>"...please..."
>Without warning, you deftly thrust into her.  Immediately, Connie lets out a cry of bliss.
>You lay across her, roughly pumping your hips in a steadily accelerating rhythm.
>She practically melts, losing practically all her composure.
>Her shaking hands wrap around you, hugging you tightly against her.
>She presses your face against her, her breasts resting just above your head.  Gently, perhaps even unintentionally, her claws rake across your back.
>Not deep enough to cut, but enough to, in some way, enhance the raw energy of the scene.
>She soon loses her grip, letting her arms fall to her sides as she pants wordlessly.
>You raise up and again look into her lust-filled eyes.  You reach up...
>And gently stroke her atop the head, running your fingers through her hair.
>She closes her eyes, leaning into your hand with a sigh.
>You slowly let your hand slip down to her ears, then begin scratching them gently.
>Eyes still closed, she slowly moves her head... and gently bites down on your hand.
>It doesn't hurt, but you can feel how sharp her teeth actually are.
>Again, this isn't enough to deter you from your duty.  If anything...
>You feel even more passionate.

>You try to pull your hand away, and Connie growls playfully, gently clamping her jaws down tighter.  You eventually manage to reclaim your hand, with her immediately returning to panting rapidly.
>With your now-freed hands, you open her legs wider, granting yourself more freedom to plunge even deeper into her warm body.  Her breathing gets even more intense, her moans louder and longer.
>She grabs the blankets of her bed tightly, her fingers digging into the soft cloth as her grip grows more and more tight.
>Eventually, you feel the finale approaching.  You gently take her hands into yours, with her squeezing them tightly.
>You lean in towards her, and she does the same.
>You share a passionate kiss just as the both of you reach your limits.
>Pure ecstasy floods your mind as you unload within her.  Her walls clamp down on you tightly.
>And then... you pull out.
>Exhausted, you collapse forwards, landing face to face with Connie, your chin nestled between her heaving breasts.
>She sighs deeply, then eventually manages to speak.
>"...I... love you."
>"I love you too."
>With that, she pulls you into another kiss.  You remain lip locked for what feels like an eternity of passion.
>Once you eventually separate, you fully dissolve, laying across her, spent.
>Connie smiles hazily, her hands gently stroking your back.  She takes a deep, shuddering breath.
>"...thank you."

>Satisfied, and happy that she seems to have enjoyed herself, you simply bask in the warm afterglow of your shared love.
>You reach up and again run your fingers through her hair.  This time, she meets your gaze, eyes twinkling with happiness.
>She frowns a bit when you begin to scratch under her chin, and she takes your hand.
>She stares down at the back of your hand, then hugs it close to her cheek, whining.
>"...I... I got too carried away, didn't I?"
>You notice bite marks in your skin.  Not deep enough to cause any damage, or even bleeding, but enough to concern her.
>You use your free hand to gently stroke her face.
>"You didn't hurt me.  You didn't get carried away, either.  I'm just glad you enjoyed it as much as I did."
>She smiles and nods.
>"You have no idea.  T-thank you, Anon.  For everything."
>She releases your hand, then wraps her arms around you, embracing you warmly.
>As you lay there, wrapped in warmth and comfort, you start to feel drowsy.
>Judging by her fluttering eyelids, Connie feels it too.
>With one final, lazy kiss, you drift off into sleep alongside your beloved shewolf.
>Rather than dream, your mind merely plays back your happiest moments with Connie, as if reminding you what led up to this night.
>You smile in your sleep, and cuddle up even closer to her.
>Tomorrow was gonna be wonderful, you were sure of it.

<Connie>

>In her sleep, she heard a familiar voice.
>His voice.  Anon's.
>He was talking about how much he loved her.  
>Her heart swelled with affection.  Connie loved Anon with all her heart, and she hoped he never doubted that.
>She leaned in close and whispered into his ears.
>"I love you, Anon.  So much."
>She laid her head back down, gently placed her hat over her face, then began dozing back off.
>Judging by him cuddling closer, Connie was certain Anon had heard her through his dreams.
>She hugged him close.
>She never wanted this to end; she wanted to hold him tightly for the rest of her life.
>...
>With a pleasant idea slowly forming in her mind, Connie slipped off into her dreams, confessions of love still lingering on her lips.
>She knew tomorrow would be a busy day; Director Hoardwell had only given her the one day off, after all.
>Perhaps Anon could come to the office with her...?
>Failing that... she could still spend some time with him in the afternoon.
>Either way, she slept soundly, assured of their mutual love for one another.

<Anon>

>Eventually, your reminiscing gives way to a proper dream...
>You stand at the head of a church packed with smiling Otherworlders, including Trip, Dub, Alyssa, and Aster.
>You brush a speck of dust off your tuxedo, then smile as the rear doors open up...
>And out she steps.
>Connie slowly advances down the aisle, resplendent in her snow white dress.
>Tears of happiness glimmer in her silver eyes, and you feel yourself shed a few as well.
>She reaches the altar, and the two of you are pronounced man and wife.
>To the sounds of cheering, you kiss her lovingly and embrace her tightly.
>Finally, the two of you can be happy together...
>Forever.
>A smile creeps across your face subconsciously as your dream unfolds.  
>You wonder if your marriage would be as happy and loving as Alyssa and Aster's...?
>Of course it would.  You love Connie, and she loves you.
>Assured of this, you cuddle up closer to her, enjoying her warm, soft fur.

>Your dream continues, toying with the idea of...
>Parenthood.
>Indeed, after another wild night like last night, you and Connie end up with a beautiful young pup.
>Though she has her mother's silver eyes, her fur is unmistakably the color of your hair.
>Your heart swells with love for your family.
>You and Connie give your child the best possible childhood, raising her right and treating her with unconditional love...

>You roll over and awaken to the sound of a rooster crowing.  You rise and look out the window...
>A chicken man, standing on the sidewalk below Connie's apartment, is sheepishly apologizing to passersby.
>You shake your head and look back over to Connie...
>She's snoring quietly, hat laid across her face.
>You quietly get dressed and sneak out of the room, letting her sleep.
>Once out of earshot, you make your way to the kitchen.
>Using what little food is available, you fashion breakfast in bed for your girlfriend.
>It's not much, but it's the thought that counts, right?
>You make sure not to cook things for too long, considering her preference for rare food.
>Once everything is done, you make your way back to the bedroom.
>You carefully open the door, then whisper.
>"Good morning..."
>Connie sits bolt upright, her hat sliding off her snout.  She blinks a few times, then claps the hat back onto her head.  With that settled, she leans back against the headboard.
>"Mmm... morning, Anon."
>"I made you breakfast if you're hungry."
>She gasps.
>"Awww... that's so sweet of you.  Thank you."
>You lay the plate across her lap, and she smiles appreciatively.
>Then frowns as she realizes she's still nude.  She carefully places the food on her nightstand, then yanks the blankets up to cover herself.

>You chuckle warmly.
>"You know, you don't have to cover up; you're beautiful."
>She stammers a bit, and you're certain she's blushing beneath her white fur.
>"A-ah... I appreciate that, but... it's not professional of me to be indecent..."
>You laugh again.
>"I thought we were past this professional stuff?  We're in love, Connie."
>She bashfully hangs her head for a moment...
>Then drops the blankets.
>"...you're right.  S-sorry."
>"Don't apologize!  I'm just telling you there's no need to hide your beauty."
>She smiles, then lunges forwards, pulling you into a hug.
>"Thank you, Anon.  I love you."
>You return her embrace; she eventually releases you, glancing at the clock.
>"I'd better eat my breakfast.  I'll have to head to work soon."
>"Oh, you've got work today?"
>"Mhm... afraid so."
>"...could I come?"
>"...maybe so?  I don't think I'll have much to do today.  You could meet my friends at work!"
>Excited, Connie wolfs down her breakfast, tail swishing happily.
>Once she finishes the food (which, as usual, doesn't take long), she gets out of bed, then slips on one of many identical coats from her closet.
>Despite the massive selection of white coats... it seems she only has the one hat.  Hm.
>Once she's dressed, Connie grin and hugs you again.
>"Ready to go, Anon?"

>You excuse yourself to grab a quick shower, then dash back to Connie upon getting cleaned up.
>"NOW I'm ready.  Let's hit the road."
>With that, you and Connie set out for her office.  As you walk, you ask some questions to pass the time.
>"So... who are your coworkers here?"
>"Well, there's Bonnie, Marnie, my employer, Lonnie... and me.  We had a man named Johnny for a while, but he had to be let go."
>"What'd he do?"
>She bares her teeth slightly.
>"It turned out he had ties to a criminal organization.  The scum was tipping his friends off when we were closing in on them."
>She snarls in indignation... then regains her composure.
>"Anyway... he was fired and arrested.  Simple as that."
>"I... see."
>Rather than push it, you simply wrap an arm around her as you continue on to the office.
>Eventually, you arrive at a rather plain white building.  Connie beams and gestures grandly.
>"Here we are: Drakewing Detective Agency."
>The two of you enter...

>It's very... plain inside.  It's a rather modern office, but rather sparsely decorated.
>The building has two floors.  Seems Connie's own office is on the ground floor, as is Marnie's.
>Guess that means Bonnie and Lonnie's offices are upstairs.
>Connie leads you into her office with a smile.
>As expected, the room is painted white.  It's extremely tidy and well organized, with not a single paper clip out of place on her rather nice wooden desk.
>A neat stack of paperwork sits atop the desk, and Connie takes a seat in a rather plush chair that's situated behind this stack.
>She grins at you.
>"Well... what do you think?"

>"It's nice; seems like you've done a great job of organizing it."
>"Thank you!  I take pride in keeping my workspace nice and neat.  Glad you like it."
>With that, she begins filing the paperwork on her desk.
>...it's not long before you fall into boredom.  She looks apologetic.
>"...sorry.  I have to get these done."
>"Mm?  Oh, it's fine, it's fine."
>...hm.
>"Actually.  I have an idea..."
>You walk over to the confused Connie and gently roll her chair back.  You crawl under her desk, then motion for her to scoot back towards it.
>She does so hesitantly...
>As soon as you have the opportunity, you unbutton the lowest buttons on her coat, then plant your face firmly in her crotch.  You begin frantically assaulting her with your tongue.
>She lets out a gasp, and trembles with anticipation.
>"J-just... take it easy so I don't mess up these papers, please."
>You nod, then slow your pace considerably.  She still fidgets and pants slightly, but attempts to focus on her work.
>You're having quite a lot of fun down here... until you hear footsteps.  Heavy ones at that.
>Connie looks up from her work and smiles.
>"Oh, good morning, Director Hoardwell.  I hope you're well?"
>You hear a derisive snort, and smell smoke.
>"I'm fine, barring your boozehound coworker."
>"Oh, is she back on duty today?"
>"Yes, but she's under probation.  One more incident and I'm probably gonna have to let her go, Connie."
>"...I- ah!"
>You flinch and momentarily stop your licking.
>"Hmm?  Are you alright, Connie?"
>"Ah, y-yes, just rolled the chair over my tail."
>The director inhales sharply.
>"Ooh, I hate it when that happens.  Well, don't let me interrupt your work.  Have a nice day, Connie."
>The heavy footsteps retreat, and Connie breathes a sigh of relief.  You resume your assault, to her delight.

>In the hopes of both preventing being caught and also bringing Connie some pleasure, you decide to finish her off quickly.
>You redouble your efforts, causing her to bite her lip and buck her hips.  Thankfully, you hear no footsteps approaching or anything...
>After what feels like far too long, she lets off a quiet sigh of relief as you bring her to a climax.
>She rolls her chair back, and you exit her desk.  Connie embraces you warmly and kisses you.
>"Th-thanks."
>You simply smile and nod.
>"So, that was your boss just now?"
>"Mhm.  Director Lonnie Hoardwell.  Would you like to go meet her?"
>"Sure, let's go."
>Connie smiles and leads you upstairs to her boss's office...

>Immediately upon stepping in, the smell of smoke overwhelms you.  Beyond that...
>Your eyes immediately fall upon a colossal stack of office supplies resting atop an ornate wood desk.
>You choke back a chuckle when Connie shakes her head and mouths:
>"Don't laugh."
>Behind the pile is a very large chair, facing away from you.  It seems that parts of the leather are scorched...
>Connie clears her throat.
>"Err, Director Hoardwell, I'd like you to meet someone."
>There's a grunt of acknowledgement, then the chair swivels around revealing...
>Holy shit.
>An actual dragon.
>For some reason, this strikes you even more than when you first met Connie.
>The director is even taller than Connie, with a rather lean build to contrast your girlfriend's robust figure.
>Her silver scales glint in the artificial light of her office, and little plumes of smoke curl up from her nostrils, just beneath her glasses.  A large pair of horns decorate her head, between which flows long, gray hair.
>She wears a rather smart gray suit, apparently cut to accommodate her wings.
>The dragoness regards you with interest, then grins broadly, showing worryingly sharp teeth.
>"Why, Connie... is this who I believe it to be?"
>"Yes, this is Anon."
>The director chuckles warmly.

>Perhaps out of nervousness, perhaps out of the ridiculous sight of the massive pile of junk on her desk, you can't help but giggle a bit.
>You immediately clap a hand over your mouth as Connie looks mortified.
>Director Hoardwell narrows her eyes...
>Then breaks into another smoky gale of laughter.
>Connie looks utterly baffled, but starts snickering herself.  You of course join in as well.
>Eventually, the director stops laughing, sighing happily.
>"...what are we laughing about?"
>You struggle for an answer, but the director smiles slyly.
>"Ohhhh, lemme guess; you've never seen a dragon before, huh?  Heheh!  Pleasure to meet ya, Anon.  I'm Lonnie Hoardwell.  You can call me Lonnie, Miss Hoardwell, or whatever."
>She extends a massive, clawed hand, and you shake it.  She nearly crushes your bones, and retracts her hand with a grimace.
>"Ooh... uh, sorry.  I'm not used to humans.  You alright?"
>You nod, blinking back tears of pain, and she sighs in relief, loosing a tiny ember of fire from her jaws.
>"Thank goodness.  So.  How do you like good old Elsewhere, eh?"
>"Oh, I love it."
>"Splendid, splendid!  Always good to hear that."
>She winks at you, then grins at Connie.
>"Say... I didn't see this fellow in your office earlier.  Where was he?"
>The shewolf's jaw drops, and she stammers.  You interject.
>"Oh, I was in the, ah, bathroom."
>"Mm.  I see."
>"...say, how did you know me?"
>"Oh, that's simple: Connie's report talked a lot about her meeting you.  I must say, you sound like a fine man."
>"Well, thank you.  What did she say about me?"
>"Only good things, Anon.  I assure you that much.  Seems my good friend has grown rather smitten with you."
>Connie sheepishly grins and adjusts her hat.
>...wait.
>"Miss Hoardwell... did you send Connie to watch me?  If so... why?"
>The room goes silent.  Quiet enough to hear a pin drop.
>The director frowns and narrows her eyes, embers rising from her nostrils.
>"That's classified."

>"Why is that?"
>More fire rises up from the dragoness's snout.
>"Because this is a very important case and I cannot have any details leaked to anyone who doesn't need to know them."
>"Why me specifically?"
>"Again, I cannot confirm nor deny explicitly assigning Inspector Lopine to investigate you."
>"Can you tell me ANYTHING?"
>Director Hoardwell stands from her chair, revealing exactly how massive she is.  Her horns gently brush the high ceiling of her office, and her wings spread out to great lengths.
>A near constant stream of fire leaks from the corners of her mouth.
>"Look.  I already told you.  I.  Can't.  Tell.  You.  ANYTHING.  Okay?!  It's as simple as that."
>She huffs indignantly, blowing black smoke your way...
>Then sighs and collapses into her chair.
>"...sorry to go full dragon on you there.  I just... I can't talk about the case.  Plus, I've been having a hell of a time with one of my colleagues lately.  Doesn't give me the right to take things out on you.  You're not in any trouble, Anon.  You didn't do anything wrong."
>She smiles faintly.
>"That's all I can say on the matter.  Sorry."
>"I understand.  Sorry to press the matter."
>She waves a hand dismissively.
>"Bah, don't worry about it.  I'm just a crabby ol' dragon who hasn't had her coffee yet, and I guess you touched a nerve.  Sorry to spook you."
>"It's fine, really.  Hope your day goes better."
>A genuine smile crosses the silver dragon's face.
>"Well, thank you, Anon.  I appreciate that."

>Sweating a bit from both nerves and the lingering heat from the director's fiery outburst, you bid her farewell and depart her office, Connie in tow.
>"Well... what did you think, Anon?"
>"...she seems nice?"
>Connie chuckles a bit.
>"She can get a bit... heated at times.  I think she liked you, though."
>"Really?"
>"Of course!  Why wouldn't she?  You're a great person."
>You blush a little and hug Connie.
>Suddenly, someone lets out a loud wolf whistle.  A brisk female voice speaks from behind you.
>"Well well well, lookit what the wolf dragged in!"
>You release Connie and turn around...
>Standing before you is a black furred fox woman in a red suit and fedora.  She's about Connie's height, but has more... modest curves.
>Her tail twitches and thrashes about wildly, and something about her demeanor seems... off kilter.
>Then, the unmistakable smell of booze hits you.
>The fox chuckles loudly and saunters over.
>"Say Connie?  Ain't ya gonna... gonna introduce me?"
>The shewolf sighs discretely, but puts on a polite grin.
>"Anon, this is-"
>The fox interrupts by yanking you into a hug.
>"Bonnie.  Bonnie Vulpin, meet ta nice ya.  Err, wait."
>Connie's smile becomes a bit more strained.
>"Anon, Bonnie is the other inspector here.  She works out in the field like I do."
>The fox nods sagely as Connie speaks, gently swaying a bit.

>This lady doesn't look so good.
>"...are you alright?  You seem kinda... out of it."
>Connie nods very faintly as Bonnie responds.
>"Eh?  Nah, nah, I'm... I'm fine, really."
>Her staggering says otherwise.
>"I could get you a cup of coffee... some water?"
>She exaggeratedly puts a hand to her chin in thought.
>"Hmm!  Yeah, I wouldn' mind a cuppa joe, acshually."
>You glance at Connie, and she shrugs before leading you to a coffee machine.
>"Thank you for doing this, Anon.  I worry about Bonnie... why would she come in to work in this state knowing that Director Hoardwell is gonna be watching her like a hawk...?"
>"Beats me.  I just hope maybe this will help."
>Connie shrugs again as the two of you make your way back to Bonnie...
>She's gone.
>Your wolf girlfriend huffs and leads you to the fox's office.

>It's an absolute wreck in here.  The whole office is cluttered and disorganized, a stark contrast to Connie's meticulously groomed office.
>Papers, aluminum cans, cigars... all tossed around with no apparent rhyme or reason.
>In the center of the room, behind a desk covered in writing and crude pocketknife carvings, sits Bonnie, reclining in a swivel chair and puffing on a cigar.
>When you walk in, she grins and waves her hat at you.
>"HEY!  It's... uh.  Ron, right?  Riiight."
>Connie clears her throat.
>"It's Anon, Bonnie.  We brought you some coffee."
>You smile awkwardly and place the mug on the fox's desk.  She grins again.
>"Thankya, Anonnie... Con, you gotta pretty nice friend here."
>Connie nods curtly, probably rolling her eyes under that hat.

>Seeing how bad off Bonnie actually is gets to you a bit.
>Making sure you're out of earshot, you whisper to Connie.
>"What happened to her?"
>Connie frowns deeply.
>"...I wish I knew, Anon.  She wasn't always like this.  She used to be on top of her game, never touching a drop of alcohol while on the clock, and rarely off duty."
>"And...?"
>"And... one day, she just showed up to work drunk, and it's been a downward spiral ever since."
>Connie sniffles a bit.
>"...she's still a good friend, even though she's dooming her career..."
>...Connie's attitude does nothing to improve the pangs of sympathy you feel towards the fox.
>You walk over to her desk.  She takes a swig of the coffee you brought, then grins.
>"Ohey, Non.  ...it is Non, right?  Nevermind.  Thanks fer the coffee, pal."
>"Oh, uh, no problem.  Feeling any better?"
>She chuckles.
>"I didn't really feel BAD ta begin with..."
>"But do you feel more levelheaded now?"
>"Oh, I guess?  ...I do kinda have a headache, though."
>As if to illustrate, she frowns and rubs her temples.  Then, she shrugs.
>"Meh.  I kinda have a headache mosta the time anyhow."
>Before you can stop yourself, you blurt out:
>"Bonnie, what happened to make you this way?"
>For the first time since you've met her, her eyes actually show remarkable clarity.
>"...I..."
>She quickly goes back to her previous attitude.
>"Dunno whatcher talkin' about, Non."
>Connie sighs, a tinge of sadness in her voice.

>Somehow you know she's feigning ignorance.
>You lean in closer and talk lower.
>"Bonnie.  You can talk to me about whatever it is that's bothering you."
>Again, she seems to have a moment of clarity.
>"...Anon, I just..."
>She trails off again, then takes another sip of coffee.
>"Yer losing me, pal; I'm not real sure what we're talkin' about."
>Connie sighs again, taking a shuddering breath.  She quietly closes the door to Bonnie's office.
>You nod at her, then speak again.
>"Bonnie, please.  Just please be honest with me."
>She stares into her mug of coffee, an inscrutable look in her eyes.
>She takes a long drag on her cigar, then sighs deeply.
>"...I'm sorry, I don't know what you mean.  Nothing's wrong here."
>Connie can't hold her tongue any longer.
>"Bonnie, please.  You and I both know this isn't you.  Please, just tell me why."
>She sounds to be on the verge of tears.
>Bonnie takes another long drag, staring at Connie sadly.  She puts out her cigar and sighs once more.
>"Connie, really.  There's nothing to worry about.  I-I'm fine.  Just- just calm down, please."

>You try multiple times to get Bonnie to open up, each time getting little more than a handwave.
>Connie is openly in tears at this point, practically begging her friend for answers.
>Eventually, the time comes for brutal honesty.
>You take a deep breath.
>"Bonnie-"
>Connie interrupts you.
>"Bonnie, she's gonna fire you when she sees you today.  She said one more incident and you were done.  Your job is- is... it's over, Bonnie."
>The fox finally seems to grasp the gravity of things.  She stares sadly, and drains the last drops of coffee from her cup.
>There's a pause...
>Then she slams her face down on her desk.  Papers fly all over the room.
>"...I know, Connie.  I knew she was gonna do it.  She told me yesterday.  Told me I had one last shot at this.  And I blew it."
>Bonnie begins to sniffle...
>"...I ain't cut out for this work.  I'm surprised I made it this far.  Lonnie shoulda kicked my sorry ass to the curb years ago."
>Connie rushes over and embraces her friend.
>"Don't say that stuff.  Bonnie, you're as good of an investigator as I am."
>"No, no I'm not.  You got no idea how bad I really am."
>The fox is full on crying now, as is Connie.  You yourself feel a few tears coming on.
>"It's the stress.  I know I used ta be sober, but I just couldn't handle the pressure anymore.  It's so hard..."
>She sighs deeply.
>"It's so hard workin'... two... jobs..."
>She trails off, merely sitting with her face firmly planted on her desk.  Connie bawls and hugs her friend tightly.

>You decide to just let the two have a moment.
>Bonnie eventually peels herself away from the desk, then returns Connie's hug, the two women still crying.
>Bonnie speaks through sobs.
>"I'm- I'm sorry I screwed it all up, Con; my job, our friendship, all of it."
>"Bonnie, you have not screwed up our friendship.  You're still my friend, job or no job.  At least you have something to fall back on, right?"
>...the fox goes silent.
>"...Bonnie?  You said you had two jobs, right?  I didn't know you worked somewhere else..."
>"..."
>Bonnie quietly attempts to hide her eyes with her hat.  Unfortunately, it being much smaller than Connie's, it does little to help.
>Connie frowns deeply, still sniffling a little.
>"...Bonnie?"
>The fox breaks away from her friend's embrace.
>"...dammit.  I-I even screwed this up too.  I can't do SHIT right."
>Bonnie walks over to her desk, then grabs a piece of paper off it.  She wordlessly unfolds it to reveal a photograph.
>The photo is silhouetted, but shows a broad-shouldered individual with 9 tails. The only color in the photo is the light of a cigarette or a cigar. Connie goes silent as she looks at it.
>"...Bonnie, why are you showing me this?  It's just that useless picture of- Him."
>You raise an eyebrow.
>"Him?"
>"Kit-o-Nine-Tails.  The most infamous mobster in Elsewhere.  We've been on his trail for years, and haven't gotten anywhere."
>Bonnie nods sadly.
>"Yeah.  Kit was my case, and I'm parta the reason why the trail's cold."
>Connie moves to embrace her friend again, but the fox stops her.
>"Bonnie, it's not your fault.  He's notorious for a reason.  We've all had trouble with this case.  Don't beat yourself up over it."
>Bonnie sighs again.

>Your curiosity is piqued.
>"Bonnie, what do you know about this Kit fellow?"
>She sighs again, staring at the photo.
>"Kit's the head of a mob o' folks like that.  Multitailers, y'know.  Well, 'cept Uno.  He's only got the one."
>Connie's jaw drops a bit.
>"You mean- you got proof Uno's tied to Kit?  When did that happen?"
>Bonnie mysteriously waves a hand, then continues talking.
>"Kit's got people all over Elsewhere, 8 of em to be exact.  But, y'see, two of em quit the crime biz."
>Connie gasps.
>"...Dub and Trip."
>Bonnie nods.
>"Yes.  All these guys have cutesy names.  I guess when you're born with a buncha tails, your parents can't help but get cheesy.  I know all of em.  Uno, Doc Quad, Quint, Sixpence, Lucky, and Ocho.  And a'course Dub, Trip, and Kit."
>"But, if you know all that, why haven't you said anything?"
>You have a theory...
>"Bonnie... does Kit have something on you?"
>She grimaces.
>"...I don't wanna talk about that.  What I can tell ya is that I bet one'a the lackies still workin' for Kit knows where to find the bastard."
>"Okay then... know anything else about Kit?"
>"Uh... well, I think Kit's a fox with 9 tails...?  Probably a pretty shady customer? ...I got nothing else. Sorry."
>Connie suddenly perks up.
>"Bonnie.  If we find Kit with your intel... Director Hoardwell would never fire you.  We have to tell her you-"
>"NO!"
>Bonnie looks legitimately panicked.
>"Ya can't tell her.  Ya- ya just can't."

>Concern washes over you.
>"Bonnie, is... your life in danger?"
>Mortified, she hesitantly nods.
>"Don't worry.  I'll do anything I can to keep you safe."
>"That's dandy, but you don't understand what kinda person Kit is.  You're up against a real mob boss here."
>"I know that, and I stand by what I said.  You can even use my house in the human world if you need to.
>Bonnie stares and stutters, then hugs you tightly.
>"T-thanks.  You two still don't understand how far this goes... but thank you for listening to me."
>Connie joins the hug.
>"Bonnie... is this why...?"
>The fox nods sadly.
>"Yeah, this ties into it."
>The three of you continue to embrace for a while, eventually breaking apart.
>"Thanks, you two.  I... I feel a little better.  I have no idea where Kit's goons are, but I wanna tell you upfront: Trip and Dub are clean.  I've triple checked em, they cut all ties with the gang."
>"That's what they told us, right Anon?"
>"Yeah, exactly."
>The fox smiles sadly, casting one more glance at the shadowed picture.
>"...this is a big case. I'm sorry to hand it over to you guys like this."
>Connie says nothing, merely patting her friend on the shoulder supportively.

>You're determined to help, but you figure it can't hurt to know what you're getting into...
>"Bonnie, what has this Kit guy done?"
>She frowns.
>"What hasn't Kit done?  A pretty good chunk of all crime in Elsewhere can be traced back to that nine-tailed freak and those vulpine goons.  Just hearing some of the stuff Dub and Trip told me about... I can only imagine what their higher-ups must have their hands in."
>"Higher-ups?"
>"Yeah.  Kit's mob follows the ol' law of numeric ordering.  Uno's the bottom of the food chain, with one tail, and Kit's the top, havin' nine of em."
>"So... count the tails and you'll know how high they rank."
>"Exactly."
>Connie hugs her friend even tighter, a few tears still running down her snout.
>"Is there anything else, Bonnie?"
>The black fox sighs and shakes her head.
>"...we have to tell Director Hoardwell about all this."
>"NO, DON'T!  Connie, I'm beggin' ya as your friend: do NOT tell Lonnie about any of this, please."
>"But-"
>"Please..."
>Bonnie looks at her friend with a pained expression, and your girlfriend sighs deeply.
>"...okay.  But if it comes down to it, we're taking this directly to her, understood?"
>"...fine.  But only as a last resort, please."
>The two detectives share a nod, then shake hands.
>...wait.
>"Connie, y'know what I just realized?  You and I are a crime-solving duo now."
>She chuckles awkwardly, and Bonnie bursts into laughter.  Connie smiles.
>"That's a good point, Anon!  Thanks for cutting the tension a bit..."

>With your goal clear, might as well make a plan of action.
>"So, Bonnie, where do you think we should start?"
>"Uh... probably with Uno, if you can find the slimy con.  He probably won't have anything too useful on his boss, but you could maybe work your way up the ranks...?  Of all the goons, Ocho is probably gonna be your endgame.  He's second in command, and if anyone knows where to find Kit it's probably him."
>"Gotcha.  ...can I ask why you don't want us to tell Lonnie about this?"
>The fox cringes and shakes her head.
>"Nuh-uh, don't wanna talk about that."
>"Okay then."
>...you have an idea.
>"Bonnie, if you're in danger right now... here."
>You hand over your keys.
>"Once you're sobered up, take my car and lay low in the human world for a while.  Connie's map to the Door is on my dashboard, you should be able to follow it back to my house."
>The fox stares down at your keys, tears welling up in her eyes.
>"...you'd do that for someone you barely know...?"
>She suddenly embraces you tightly.
>"...thank you, Anon.  You're a good guy.  You've got my word I'll do this if things go south.  And I swear I won't drive your car drunk."
>You nod curtly.
>"Just... take care, okay?"
>She smiles and nods.

>Time to make a plan.
>"Do you have any case files that are tied to Kit's work?"
>"Uh... a few.  I also have some files on all Kit's goons if you're interested."
>"Great, that ought to help."
>She hands over a stuffed folder labeled "Nine-Tailed Bastard" and smiles.
>You open it up to find several case files, as well as 8 photographs.
>2 of them are labeled "clean", and they're of Dub and Trip respectively.
>The rest are of various fox folk with increasing numbers of tails.
>"Thanks, Bonnie.  This'll help a lot.  Connie, do you have any files that might help?"
>"Well... Kit is Bonnie's case, so I probably don't have anything she doesn't already have in that folder."
>Bonnie nods.
>"Yeah, anything that smelled like Kit is in there, including stuff you investigated, Con."
>"I figured.  Any patterns to his work?"
>"...not really, no.  Seems like Kit is intentionally avoiding establishing a pattern or MO beyond the tail quirk.  Sneaky slimeball."
>"Makes sense.  I think we've got enough to get started, myself... Anon, what do you say we go look for some goons?"
>"Ready when you are."
>The two of you bid Bonnie farewell, then exit her office.  You hear her sigh one last time as the door closes behind you.
>Connie looks down at the folder thoughtfully.
>"...we have to find him.  Even if we can't save Bonnie's job... maybe we can at least help her get over the drinking."
>"Right... where do we start?"
>Connie startles you by baring her teeth a bit.
>"I think it's time to pay my old friend Uno a visit."
>She dashes out of the agency, and you run after her.
>You eventually catch up outside, with her angrily watching a crowd build around a crudely constructed stage...

>You and Connie quietly blend into the crowd, and you hear a man's voice ring out from the stage.
>A voice with one of the heaviest, most bizarre accents you've ever heard.
>"Cood afternoon, Elsevhere!  I am pleased to be havink you join me for ze sale of a lifetime: I offer you, mine falued customers, ze finest leazzer jackets in town, for ze absolute best prices.  I tell you I am practically zhooting myself in ze foot with zese pricings, but I do it for you, my walued customers.  Zo, who is interested, eh?"
>To your amazement, many of the crowd cheer and line up.  This despite the fact that this fellow is obviously not on the level.
>The silver fox, clad in the cheapest, most garish plaid suit possible, grins with silver teeth, winking at his audience as his tail sways about gracefully.
>He seems to take notice of you, and gestures grandly.
>"Ah, an human!  Come, come, mine friend, and join me!"
>You walk up to the stage, and the fox smiles again... only to get a panicked expression when he realizes Connie is walking alongside you.
>As she approaches, he begins stammering.
>"E-err, I's apologize, mine belofed customers, it zeems that Uno's store is to be closink now!  P-please come again zoon!"
>He grabs a cheap, beaten up carpetbag and leaps from the stage, dashing off.
>Connie immediately sprints after him, clapping a hand onto her hat.
>"YOU'RE MINE, DIRTBAG!"
>He lets out a girlish shriek and runs faster, only to trip over his own tail.  Uno falls to the ground and lies there in terror as Connie bears down on top of him.
>Once she reaches him, she snarls angrily as you tentatively approach.
>The fox smiles unconvincingly as he slowly stands, knees shaking and tail tucked between his legs.
>"H-hello Lopine... y-you're quite faster than I fought.  A-and hello, ah, human.  M-my name is Uno, Uno Singlair."
>He shakily extends a hand, and you awkwardly shake it.

>Seeing as Connie has quite handily taken the role of bad cop, you decide to play nice.
>"Nice to meet you, Uno.  I'm Anon."
>"Ah, vhat an... interestink name."
>Connie clears her throat dangerously.
>"Singlair.  Drop the accent.  We all know it's fake."
>He gulps nervously, then frowns.
>"...S-sorry, Lopine, it's actually wery real."
>You smile warmly as she snorts in disbelief.
>"So, Uno: how's business?"
>That silver grin returns to his face for a moment, then vanishes when he catches sight of Connie's unimpressed reaction.
>"It's, uh... it's goink rather vell actually.  I zold a few jackets before you two zhowed up, heehee..."
>"I see.  So you've had a pretty nice morning then?"
>"Oh ja, ja... it's been a preddy good vun."
>Connie remains silent, merely glaring at the conman, teeth bared a little.  He makes no attempt to hide his terror beyond putting on a dishonest smile.
>You clear your throat.
>"Uno.  What can you tell me about Kit-o-Nine-Tails?"
>He gasps and drops his smile altogether.  
>"H- w- y- What makes you think a simple businessman like me has ties to someone like THAT?"
>You note with a chuckle that his "wery real" accent has vanished altogether.
>Connie wordlessly extracts a photo from the folder, showing Uno seated with a few multitailed fox folk.
>"...t-that could be any silver fox."
>She pulls another photo, the same scene from a different angle.  This one shows Uno's unmistakable silver teeth.
>"...a-ah."
>He frowns and continues to shake nervously.
>"...Lopine, I'm surprised at you.  You see me almost every day, and yet now you suddenly realize who I work for?  How did you figure that out...?"
>She glares silently.
>"That's for me to know, not you, Singlair."
>"F-fair enough.  ...I don't know much about Kit.  I'm not exactly the highest ranking member of this organization, heehee..."
>"Well, anything is helpful, Uno."
>"...ah... well, Kit has been rather upset about losing Dub and Trip.  That boy was our muscle..."

>"Just muscle?  Muscle can be hired, Uno."
>"Heh, it can.  But... Kit is an eccentric individual.  It's not every day you come across a two-tailed fox with the kind of strength you need in an enforcer.  Trust me, if it weren't for Kit's insistence on the tail gimmick, we'd have replaced Dub and Trip by now..."
>"Well..."
>...time to see if you can put some pressure on him.
>"...I heard tell that Kit's about to do some shakeups with the organization.  Bringing in some new blood... and cutting some old ties.  Specifically, low-ranking types."
>Uno frowns for a moment, then smiles uncomfortably.
>"You're full of shit, Anon.  I may be the bottom of the totem pole, but I know what the boss is and isn't doin'.  Kit is way too into this 9 tail thing to do any reordering.  No, unless we come across a two-tailed and a three-tailed fox in need of work, Dub and Trip's leaving is gonna have a permanent impact."
>"I see.  Is there anything else?"
>"What do you want from me?  Kit's not the type to let someone like me wander around town with sensitive intel; that'd be suicide in this business.  My job is to run rackets.  Easy as that."
>"Why?"
>"Why?  That's a damn good question.  We got plenty of funding with that worthless investor.  My only guess is that the big boss just likes the feel of a growing bank account."
>"Does he have you do anything else?"
>"...odds and ends, yes.  Mainly grunt work, occasionally running actual errands like picking up some cigars.  The boss is a bit of an aficionado of fine cigars, y'see."
>"I see.  So you steal them to get brownie points?"
>"...yeah, more or less."
>In stark contrast with his charismatic attitude from before, Uno has practically deflated into a defeated goon, frowning and sighing between questions.

>"Something isn't adding up, Uno.  How do you get those smokes to Kit if you don't know where he is?"
>"Heh, when did I say I didn't know how to find the boss...?"
>"Oh, so you know, then?  Why not enlighten us?"
>"Heheheheh, and get myself hanged with my own tail?  Please.  All you need to know is that Kit's in Elsewhere.  I bring the cigars to our briefings and such."
>"Briefings, eh?"
>"Mhm.  Kit claims it's the quickest way to assign orders."
>"What's his next move?"
>"...as if I'd tell you that."
>"Now now, there may be a good reason to talk.  Who knows?  Maybe some charges might just blow over if you give us what we need?"
>"You think I'm worried about my record?  Please.  My rap sheet's longer than you are tall, Anon.  All I gotta do is sit back and wait for the ol' rich boy to bail me out, like always, and it's right back to what I do best."
>Connie snarls loudly.
>"I'm running out of patience fast, Singlair.  Tell us what you know about how to find your boss NOW."
>He flinches and raises a hand protectively.
>"Alright, alright, sheesh.  Kit doesn't keep to one office long.  There's a whole slew of em spread across town.  You'll never find the right one checking em all.  By the time you get close, Kit'll have fled.  The boss ain't stupid.  But... I'd be willing to wager someone above me knows a bit more about how to contact the boss."
>"Where do we find your superiors?"
>"Uh... I think Doc's around the Tower today...?  Not sure about Quint or that stupid Sixpence.  I never ask where Lucky is, she's usually easy to keep up with, and Ocho's probably hunkered down somewhere close to Kit, preparing."
>"...for what?"
>"Beats the hell outta me.  All I know is that, for the first time since I've been part of this organization... Kit didn't tell us what the endgame was for this plan."
>"And that's..."
>"Not normal, no.  Frankly?  It scares the hell outta me."

>"So, how'd you get into all this anyway?"
>Uno grins again, only to drop his smile when Connie clears her throat again.
>"Well... I've been running, uh, perfectly legitimate businesses in Elsewhere for years now.  It's just... one day I sold a watch to some big, eight-tailed fella I hadn't seen in town before.  He took one look at it after paying me and asked my why the brand name was misspelled.  That was the last thing I heard before he socked me.  When I woke up, he offered me a job, said he liked my moxie.  Ever since Ocho hired me, I've worked for Kit's gang."
>"Have you climbed the ranks any?"
>He takes on a noticeably more bitter tone.
>"Like hell I've climbed the ranks.  I'm stuck at the bottom rung just because I ain't got but the one tail.  Doesn't matter how much I bust my ass, I'm never gonna move up."
>Connie interjects.
>"You sound bitter, Singlair."
>"Bitter?  Me?  Why would I be bitter?  Not like I'm out there every day bendin' over backwards for the big dogs while useless jackasses like Sixpence outrank me just BECAUSE HE'S GOT SIX TAILS!"
>Uno snarls and kicks a nearby lightpost, then spits on the sidewalk.
>"...yeah.  I'm a little bitter.  What about it?"
>You smile and extend a hand.
>"How would you like to turn over a new leaf, Uno?  Get back at your boss by helping us bring him in."
>He seems heavily conflicted, but Uno eventually nods and shakes your hand.
>"Y'know what?  Fuck the crime game.  I've been at this long enough.  Uno Singlair is goin' legit."

>Connie drops her snarl and smiles, shaking Uno's hand.  He looks positively shocked.
>"Wh- you're just gonna shake my hand like that?  Soon as I went legit?  Lopine, you know I'm a crook!"
>"Correction, Uno: you WERE a crook.  You quit, and I'm happy for you."
>"...thanks.  I've been sick of this racket for years to be honest.  Kinda feels good to ditch it."
>You shake the man's hand as well.
>"Glad to have you on the right side of the law, Uno.  Who do you think we ought to go after first?"
>"Ah, hm.  I'm tempted to say go in order of tails just for the sake of spiting Kit's stupid organization gimmick.  Besides, I know where Doc is.  I don't know where to find the others."
>"What do you know about Doc Quad?"
>"He thinks of himself as a gentleman thief.  He does a lot of the thinking in this operation, and he's not a bad crook either.  Probably the easiest member of the bunch to get along with, but you cross him and he'll stab ya in the kidneys with a smile and an apology."
>"...okay then.  Uno, do you know anything about what Kit has on Inspector Vulpin?"
>He frowns.
>"Who now?  That name don't ring any bells with me.  Sorry, pal."
>"Well, she's Connie's friend, and said something to do with Kit was stressing her out big time."
>"...I'll bet she got on Quint's bad side.  Nasty, nasty son of a bitch, he is.  Master of getting dirt on people, and insufferable."
>"I see.  Do you have any idea what he could have?"
>"Nah, his dirt's just for the 'higher ups', y'know.  Not for goons like me to see.  Feh."
>He shrugs and spits again.

>"Think we should get Dub and Trip onboard?"
>"...not a bad idea.  Dub's a pretty big fella, and Trip's got a good head on her shoulders.  Plus... they've got their own reasons to bring Kit down."
>"...what reasons?"
>Uno snarls again.
>"Well y'see, when those two lovebirds split, the boss acted like it was fine... then they started getting the threats.  The guilt trips.  The whole nine yards.  I gotta give them credit, they've stuck to their guns for a good while now.  Last I heard Kit actually gave up on bringing em back in... but Ocho hasn't."
>"...I see.  Think it's safe to bring them?"
>"I'll be honest with ya: I have no idea.  I'm the bottom of the food chain, and I coulda shot you between the eyes an hour ago if I wanted, see?"
>He pulls a revolver from his carpetbag, then puts it back.
>"...but the others are probably not gonna be as receptive as me.  Look, I've been sick of this shit for a while now.  The higher ups?  They got cushy positions they probably ain't too keen about leavin'.  'Specially the REAL bigwigs, 6 through 9."
>He sighs.
>"Look, I can't promise ya this won't get ugly."
>"I understand.  Now, is Doc a threat?"
>"Is Doc a threat, he says.  In the same vein any knife enthusiast is, I guess.  More specifically, in the vein that's bein' cut open with a knife, heheh.."
>Uno chuckles at his own dark joke, then frowns.
>"He's not too bad, he's got some chivalry in him.  He ain't gonna pull anything too sneaky if you come out and talk to him like a 'gentleman'.  He's bonkers for that kinda shit.  Just don't get too cozy or set him off, alright?"
>"Understood."

>You pull out your phone and dial up Trip.  She answers within two rings.
>"Hey, Anon.  What's up?"
>"Hey, Trip.  Can you and Dub meet me and Connie somewhere?  We need to talk about something."
>There's a pause.
>"...what is it?"
>"It's about... Kit."
>You hear Trip snarl and swear angrily.
>"Alright, listen: meet us at Dub's place, capiche?"
>"Got it.  We'll be there in just a bit."
>Trip hangs up, and you nod.
>"Alright, we're meeting at Dub's apartment.  Should we grab Bonnie?"
>Connie puts a hand to her chin.
>"I think that'd be okay, but we may ought to let her lay low after this."
>You quickly call up the detective, then the four of you set off to Dub's apartment.

>As soon as you walk in, Trip chucks a mug at Uno, who yelps and ducks.
>"Whadja bring this slimy jackass for?"
>Uno gulps nervously.
>"Trip, please.  I'm going legit."
>She narrows her eyes, tails fidgeting madly.
>"...you got sick of the abuse too, huh?"
>"Yes.  I'm sick and tired of doing all the grunt work with no chance of moving up unless I suddenly grow more tails."
>The vixen nods and suddenly hugs Uno.
>"...glad yer doing the right thing.  Now then... what's the plan here?"
>Trip smiles at you and Connie, then frowns when her eyes fall on Bonnie.
>"...do I know you?  You look kinda familiar."
>Bonnie looks confused.
>"I don't... think we've met, Trip.  I'm Bonnie."
>The two foxes shake hands awkwardly as Trip looks very confused.  Dub finally speaks up.
>"Uh... so we gonna bust the boss or what?"
>You nod.
>"Yep, we're gonna try to bring Kit and his goons in."
>"Uh...!  That's great.  It'll be, uh, nice to break things up."
>Trip grins.
>"I agree, loverboy.  It's gonna be a blast to wipe the smile offa those bigwigs' faces.  Anon, Connie, Bonnie, what's the plan?"

>You nod towards Uno.
>"According to our new friend here, we should start with Doc Quad."
>Trip frowns.
>"I never liked that guy.  Too formal, gives me the creeps."
>"Uh... yeah.  I don't, uh, I don't like Doc much either."
>"We know we need to start with him, but we gotta find him first."
>Uno grins, his silver teeth glinting in the light.
>"Last I saw him, he was around the Tower."
>Dub's jaw drops.
>"Uh...!  Uno, where's your, uh, accent?"
>"What?  It was fake, two-tail.  The whole time."
>The bulky fellow looks legitimately betrayed.
>"Sorry to blow your mind, big guy.  Anyway... if we play our cards right, we just might get Doc on our team."
>Connie gasps.
>"You think so, Uno?"
>"Yeah, maybe.  The others, I'm not sure.  Sixpence, Lucky, and Ocho?  Probably not.  Quint is a wildcard in this case.  But Doc?  We may have a shot there."
>A thought hits you...
>"What if we have to fight?"
>Trip, Dub, and Uno all frown.  The one tailed ex-con sighs and speaks.
>"If it comes to it, you'll wanna know everyone's specialty.  Doc's good with a knife.  Quint prefers more sophisticated stuff; he's usually got tasers and shit.  Sixpence is the only jackass who can't be bothered to learn how to fight.  Lucky's a one-woman arsenal, so... maybe make sure she's not packing.  Ocho is a firm believer in the classics.  Brass knuckles and a Tommy gun are his go-tos."
>"What about Kit?"
>"Never seen the boss get into a scrape.  Who knows?"
>Bonnie scoffs loudly.
>"Yeah.  Who knows anything about Kit...?"
>Trip narrows her eyes at the detective.
>"You got a grudge or somethin', sweetheart?"
>The black-furred fox nods bitterly, and Trip seems satisfied.
>"I gotcha.  We'll get 'im."
>With a plan all worked out, you, Connie, Dub, Trip, and Uno head out after agreeing Bonnie should keep her head down.

>As you and your crew make your way to the Sky Blue Tower, you can't help but hum every song with the word "Fox" in the title you can think of.
>It helps keep your mind off the fact that you're about to be facing off with a knife nut who fancies himself a gentleman thief.
>Chances are he's probably just a crook who's fallen for his own lie...
>You mentally prepare to shoot for diplomacy regardless.  Just in case he actually IS a gentleman of any kind.
>Connie claps a hand on your shoulder and smiles.  Momentarily forgetting your company, you kiss her lovingly, quickly breaking apart when Trip fawns over you and Uno snickers.
>"Heheh, who'd've thought my 'luffley Lopine' would go for a human...?"
>Dub bonks the one-tailed ex-con on the head.
>"Uh... leave em alone, Uno.  They ain't, uh, hurtin' you."
>"Alright, alright, sheesh."
>Once you make it to the base of the Tower, your target makes himself VERY obvious.

>An obviously elderly fox stands in the midst of a crowd, wearing a tweed jacket, a bowler hat, and a small pair of glasses.
>He stands perfectly upright despite carrying a jeweled cane, and puffs on a pipe while chatting amiably with the townsfolk.
>Apparently not a soul spots him casually picking their pockets as he speaks, never missing a beat.
>Once the fellow seems satisfied, he doffs his hat and briskly strolls away...
>Only to stop with a friendly smile when his eyes fall upon another mark passing by.  He immediately engages the woman in conversation, following her as she walks.
>Before long, he bids her farewell, having managed to reach into her purse and snatch her wallet with ease.
>You and your companions stay out of sight for now.

>As you continue to watch the fox pick every pocket in his vicinity, you hatch a plan.
>"Uno, he doesn't know you went legit.  See if you can lead him somewhere where we can talk to him face to face."
>"Alright.  Watch me, alright?  If he gets stabby I'm gonna need backup."
>With that, your ally heads off to speak to his old colleague.  As soon as the four-tailed gent lays eyes on Uno, he perks up.
>"Ah!  Mister Singlair!  To what do I owe the pleasure?"
>Oh geez.  This man sounds like every stereotypical British gentleman in every movie ever.
>"Ah, hello, Doc!  May I haff a vord with you in private?"
>"...hrm.  Is something the matter, old boy?"
>"Err, you could zay that, yis."
>"Very well.  Come, come, we shall speak in this alleyway."
>The cane-toting gent leads Uno towards the alley you and your crew happen to be hiding in.  You all crouch behind a dumpster as he approaches.
>"Well then... what seems to be the problem, Mister Singlair?"
>Connie steps out from behind the dumpster and clears her throat.
>"Doc Quad, I presume?"
>The apparently unflappable thief smiles genuinely.
>"Ah, I see.  You are... Inspector Lopine, I believe?  A pleasure, madam.  I am indeed Doc Quad, at your service."
>He bows deeply, tails waving in many directions.
>"Mister Singlair, I can only deduce that you have left the service of Master Kit...?"
>Uno nods, watching the Doc carefully.
>"I have, Quad."
>"I see.  I must say I hadn't expected such treachery from even a man of your status.  You've surprised me, old chap."
>Doc's tails suddenly jolt upright as he turns towards your hiding place.
>"I say: come out from there!  I may be getting along in years, but I daresay I can still hear you breathing, you roustabouts!"
>You step out, hands raised, and Dub and Trip follow suit.  Doc smiles again.
>"I say.  Mister DuBois and Madame Tertiare.  What a surprise to see you here!  And with a... human gentleman at that."
>Doc seems remarkably calm to be so outnumbered.

>You smile and attempt to look as nonthreatening as possible.
>"Doc, we just want to talk to you."
>"Of course, of course.  Though I must say: judging by the number of you, I daresay you lot don't trust me."
>"Can you forgive us for being a bit distrustful?"
>He chuckles warmly.
>"I suppose I can.  Can't be too careful these days, I say.  Might I ask what it is you wish to speak about, Mister Mous?"
>Your blood runs cold.
>"How did you..."
>He chuckles again, his smile taking on a more sinister quality now.
>"A gentleman must know his conversational partner's name, correct?  It would be rude of me not to know how to address you.  But I digress.  I would like to know your business with me.  I am a patient man, Mister Mous, but even I have my limits."
>"...we need your help."
>Connie nods, and Doc holds up a hand.
>"Terribly sorry, Mister Mous, but I would rather enjoy hearing this from Inspector Lopine.  Would you care to elucidate your companion's speech for me, madam?"
>Connie clears her throat.
>"Quad, we need information on your superiors."
>The elderly gent huffs indignantly.
>"Harumph.  Superiors, indeed.  Please go on."
>"We're planning to bring Kit in and break up his gang."
>"I see.  And you require my assistance to ascertain the locations of my colleagues, correct?"
>"That's right."
>He removes his glasses and wipes them with a handkerchief, revealing that he's suffering from the beginnings of cataracts.
>"Very well then.  Thank you for the wonderful explanation, Inspector.  And might I add, that is a lovely chapeau."
>Connie subconsciously puts a hand atop her hat protectively, and Doc chuckles.
>"Oh, worry not.  I wouldn't dream of liberating you of such a fine addition to your ensemble."
>You smile politely before speaking again.
>"Doc, what got you into this gang?"
>"Ah, I remember it as though it were only yesterday..."

>"...you see, I have been a gentleman thief for many years now.  I began when I was a young man, younger even than Mister DuBois.  At first, I was brash.  Even ungentlemanly at times.  But, as I grew more mature, I endeavored above all else to become a proper gentleman.  In doing so, I met some very interesting individuals.  Not the least of which was Master Kit.  Ah, I fondly recall our meeting... I managed to burgle the Master's watch directly from the wrist.  I was offered a job on the spot, as they say.  Ever since, I have made it my duty to be an excellent member of this organization."
>"...wouldn't you rather use your talents in a more legitimate business?"
>For the first time since you've met him, Doc looks a bit wistful.
>"Ah... I must admit I have considered it, old chap.  I have considered hanging up my old ways and adopting a new life.  Perhaps even retire to my home and spend the remainder of my days in my study..."
>He pulls a small locket from his breast pocket and sighs.
>"...reminiscing on those warm days spent with my beloved.  Alas, Mister Mous, I grow older and wearier with every year that passes.  The relentless march of time has taken its toll on this old gentleman, and I have conceded this fact years ago."
>He bows deeply.
>"And that, ladies and gentlemen, is my story.

>"You know, Doc, you still have time to change.  You can still leave this life behind."
>He smiles again.
>"Yes, I suppose that's true... though I rather dislike the thought of betraying the Master's trust that way.  I am a loyal man, Mister Mous, and I do not take such matters lightly."
>His voice takes on a more... dangerous tone.
>"Mister Singlair.  Mister DuBois.  Madame Tertiare.  The three of you have proven yourselves far from loyal to your employer.  I do not appreciate such disloyalty."
>He sighs deeply, losing his imposing tone.
>"...though I must admit, were I in your situations I would find my ironclad dedication challenged.  You, my single-tailed friend, were doomed to remain a lowly serf amongst nobles despite your truly impressive efforts.  Mister DuBois, your strength of both body and character is admirable.  It takes a powerful gentleman to leave an organization such as this for your beloved.  ...I only wish that I were able to do the same before it was too late."
>The old fox's voice wavers a bit, but he quickly regains his composure.
>"Madame Tertiare, I must say I respect your tenacity and willingness to stand up to even the likes of Mister Octavian.  ...the three of you, despite your disloyalty, have earned my respect and admiration, two things that I do not bestow lightly."
>The three younger foxes thank their elder, and he chuckles warmly.
>"...I do wonder if perhaps Mister Octavian will be lobbying for my departure soon, given my advancing age.  Though, the Master is rather insistent on maintaining the quantity of tails quirk of our ranks.  It seems to trump usefulness of an individual at times, such as in the case of your nephew, Mister Singlair."
>Uno snarls and nods.
>"I mean no disrespect, but I daresay young Mister Hexadin is, to be blunt, a layabout."
>"No offense taken, Doc.  He's useless."
>"Indeed."

>You decide to keep talking about the old fellow's potential retirement.
>"Doc, may I ask what career you might've taken if you weren't a thief?"
>"Ah, of course; I had dreams of performing in the opera as a lad.  But, sadly, ''twas a doomed dream.  I fear I cannot carry a tune in a bucket, as they say.  So, instead, I set out to become a thespian.  Of course... I abandoned such a career once I fell under the employ of Master Kit."
>"I see.  Doc, with all due respect, I think it may be time to admit defeat here.  It's the gentlemanly thing to do."
>He chuckles warmly, a faint hint of resignation to his voice.
>"I believe you're correct, old chap.  I have been thieving for long enough.  From this day forward... Phineas 'Doc Quad' Quadrain is retired."
>He sighs deeply in what almost sounds like relief, then again pulls the locket from his pocket.
>"...My dear, sweet Elizabeth, I only regret not having the strength to do so when it was prudent."
>A few tears run down the old gentleman's snout.
>Connie steps forward, frowning.
>"Elizabeth...?"
>"My wife.  Alas... taken from me before her time."
>Connie shocks Doc by pulling him into a warm embrace.
>"I'm sorry for your loss, sir."
>He shakingly returns her gesture.
>"...thank you, madam.  That's very kind of you.  Please, tell me what this old man can do to help you."
>"We really need to know where to find Quint, or any of the others."
>"Ah, I see.  Mister Pentwell is a reclusive chap.  I believe you'll find him within his usual lair, an abandoned arcade on the outskirts of Elsewhere.  I'm afraid Mister Hexadin's whereabouts elude me at this time.  I do believe Madame Septen was undercover at a local business... though I regret to say the name of said business has entirely slipped my mind.  Mister Octavian... well, unfortunately I am not considered an important enough associate to know the location of his office.  Nor that of Master Kit's lair."
>"Thank you, Mister Quadrain."

>Connie nods affirmatively, then removes her notepad from its usual storage.  Doc averts his eyes as she does so.
>"Alright... I believe that's all we need.  Thank you for your cooperation, and congratulations on your retirement."
>The old gent bows.
>"It was my pleasure, madam."
>You all bid Doc farewell, and begin to leave, then stop when he speaks up.
>"Inspector... do you mind terribly if I come along?  I have some... grievances I wish to take to my former superiors.  More specifically, Misters Hexadin and Octavian."
>Doc smiles... but there is absolutely no friendliness behind it.  Only malice.
>Connie flinches at his cold grin, but nods.
>"If you want, feel free."
>"Wonderful, madam.  I shall endeavor to be a helpful member of this team."
>With that, the 6 of you make your way to the arcade at Doc's instruction.

>...it's dead silent out here at the edge of Elsewhere.  Even the roads are barren, with not a car to be seen.
>Doc gestures grandly and bows.
>"Here we are: Mister Pentwell's domain.  A word of warning: he will be considerably less receptive than I.  He enjoys a rather... comfortable job."
>You nod, then make your way inside with your companions.
>It's apparent as soon as you enter: you're dealing with a geek.
>The whole arcade is decorated and lit as if still active.  Cabinets everywhere blip and play unrecognizable jingles.
>However... the arcade is empty.  Not a soul plays the cabinets.
>For a moment, your brain describes this place as Purgatory for video games...
>A massive monitor hangs on the opposite wall, showing a stylish icon in the shape of a fox's head.  5 tails jut out from behind it in a star pattern.
>That'll be Quint's logo, then.  What kind of mobster has his own logo...?
>Trip grumbles.
>"Quint likes ta do video calls.  I'd bet dollars ta donuts he'll be poppin' up on that screen any second now."

>You slowly approach the massive screen, and clear your throat.
>"Uh... hello?"
>Immediately, every cabinet in the arcade lets out a low drone as the entire room is plunged into deep red light.
>The logo onscreen fades out...
>Replaced with the leering skull of a fox.  A cluster of wires enters one of its eye sockets, while the other houses an LED light.  Five tails twitch behind this ghoulish visage, which soon begins speaking in a raspy voice.
>"Main screen turn on!  Welcome to die, foolish mortals."
>The skeletal face's LED eye roams over your crew, stopping on each member as the voice addresses them individually.
>"Lololol nice tits, lady; don't you know it's rude to wear a hat indoors?  Wowowow lookit the hairless wonder!  Omgomg it's fuckin' Uno; it's like I'm lookin' at a Goomba.  Ayyyyyy it's Dub, the only gorilla to ever pass as a fox.  Ey Trip, izzat short for triple D's?  Take it off, babe.  Owo, it's Pops; I didn't know you knew what an arcade was, old man."
>Everything the voice says is subtitled, for some reason.  Also... he speaks so fast it's honestly a little disorienting.
>The figure you assume must be Quint fixes his LED gaze on you with a wide skeletal grin.
>"Welllll?  Whatcha want, noob?  I got better things to do than hang around and watch you snoo-PING AS usual around my domain."
>Oh god.  He's a memer.
>Connie whispers something to Dub and Trip, and they quietly walk away.  The skull's eye follows them.
>"Wow.  Such plan.  Very discrete.  I've got cameras everywhere, sugartits.  And mics."
>Connie snarls as Dub and Trip come back sheepishly.

>Your head aches a bit as you process the word vomit that just spewed from your adversary's screen.
>...how does he know these memes?
>"Wait... those are all from the human internet.  How did you-"
>"LOLOLOLOL as if I don't have access to the human internet!  Best.  Investment.  Ever.  I've been downloading ROMs, YouTube videos, the whole shebang!  I guess you could say... I am a pirate!"
>Every single sentence that comes out of his mouth makes you cringe on an existential level.
>"Okay then.  Look.  We just want to know where to find your boss."
>"ROFLMFAO!  Like I'd tell you noobs where to find the computer room.  I mean, the bosses' offices.  Nope, you might as well fuck off if that's what you came here for."
>Sigh.
>"What if I beat you at a game?  Would you tell us then?"
>"WTF?  You think you can beat a 1337 haxxor like me?  Lololololol!  Ain't that cute?"
>Suddenly, his previously green LED goes red as his voice is amplified massively.
>"BUT IT'S WRONG!!!!"
>He returns to his normal volume, but his eye remains red.
>"You cannot beat me.  I'll squeeze the jelly from your eyes!  Name your game, faggot.  I'll annihilate you.  Oh, and one more condition:"
>"What?"
>"When I win... Trip and Connie have to take their tops off."
>The two ladies snarl loudly, and Quint's voice gets louder again.
>"SHUT UP!  We do this on MY terms or you get NOTHING!  YOU LOSE!  Understand?  Now.  Name.  Your.  Game."

>Quint begins playing the Jeopardy music as he seems to quickly lose his patience.
>"For the love of- JUST NAME YOUR GAME YOU PIECE OF-"
>He's cut off by the screen going dark.  You look around in confusion just as a nearby door is gently opened.
>Doc steps out, smiling... leading a scrawny fennec fox out of the backroom with a knife to his throat.
>"Apologies, Mister Mous.  This hooligan went too far when he made that demand of the ladies."
>The five-tailed fox is quite pathetic in person, being short, thin, and quite obviously weak.  He snarls ineffectually, apparently not noticing Doc's polite smile growing more strained.
>"Lemme go, you old fart!  Times have changed, I outrank you!"
>"And yet, I'm not the one with a blade at my neck."
>Doc makes a point of pressing his knife closer to Quint's throat, quickly shutting the younger fellow up.
>"Now then.  I believe it's in your best interest to cooperate with Inspector Lopine, Mister Pentwell.  Otherwise I daresay... you may find yourself with a rather close shave."
>...you're glad Doc's on your side now.
>Quint panics.
>"Okay okay okay!  Shit, just don't kill me!  Whattya need from me, sugart-"
>Doc glares at Quint sharply.
>"INSPECTOR? WHATTYA NEED, INSPECTOR, MA'AM?"
>The elder fox smiles smugly.
>"Mister Mous, given that he so rudely addressed your beloved, would you like to give this hooligan what for?"
>...you can't resist.  Doc moves his knife a bit, and you plant a meaty kick directly into Quint's crotch.  He drops like a rock, whining.

>Once Quint recovers, he stands up and swings at you, only for Dub to grab him and hold him back.
>"Nuh-uh.  You're not, uh, gonna do that."
>While he's incapacitated, Connie starts interrogating the fennec.
>"How did you get into this mob?
>"I'm a hacker.  A damn good one too; I managed to get into the human-net, after all.  I get info for the bosses."
>You chime in.
>"How?"
>"Hah!  Like I'd tell you that."
>Connie growls, and Quint shuts up.
>"Now then.  Where are your superiors?"
>"I'm not telling you that either."
>Dub squeezes the stubborn hacker tightly.
>"Alright, alright!  Sixpence is hanging out at a fancy restaurant downtown; Lucky is working at a theatre!  I don't know where Ocho and Kit are, I swear!"
>Doc narrows his eyes and unfolds a butterfly knife.
>"I SWEAR!  OCHO WON'T TELL ME ANYTHING ABOUT HIS OFFICE OR KIT'S!"
>Doc closes his knife with a satisfied grin.
>"Is that all you need, Inspector?  Or shall I persuade the cur further?"
>"That's all we need, Mister Quadrain.  Thank you."
>Dub drops Quint roughly.  The hacker coughs and sputters.
>"...what makes you think I'm not gonna call the bosses and tell em you're coming?"
>Trip steps out of the back room with a vicious grin.
>"That huge fire that just magically started in yer computer room.  Dunno how THAT happened."
>"M-MY RIG!"
>Quint panics and runs around in search of a fire extinguisher while you and your crew rush out of his lair.
>Once you're home free, Doc chuckles.
>"That went rather well, wouldn't you say?"
>Everyone mutters in agreement, with Connie smiling and thanking everyone for their help.
>Next stop: Sixpence.

>As you and your merry band make your way to Sixpence's hideout, you begin to think about some things you've learned...
>"Hey Uno... isn't this guy your nephew?"
>The ex-conman snarls.
>"Ohhh yeah.  Sixpence's my sister's useless son.  Stupid waste of space."
>"What's his job?"
>"Well, he mainly sits on his ass and takes in dividends from the actual work people like me and Doc do.  But... he's also the boss's investor.  See, Six married rich; grabbed him a millionaire widow who was a literal cougar.  When time came home to collect, she left the bastard everything.  Never had any kids, y'see.  So, he dumps money into whatever shit Kit needs at the moment."
>"Oh, okay then..."
>"I'm tellin' ya, if it weren't for his money he'd be outright useless.  Even then it's debatable."
>You nod as another thought comes to mind.
>"Do you guys think Kit may be up to something in the Human World...?"
>Dub and Trip frown, and Doc huffs.
>"Unfortunately, I haven't the faintest clue what Master Kit's plan is.  How strange... usually my feedback is requested on any plans made by the Master, but not this time."
>Uno nods.
>"Yeah, yeah; somethin' screwy is going on this time.  Ocho wouldn't even tell me the endgame."
>Dub interjects.
>"Uh...!  I didn't, uh, see anyone from the gang in the Human World..."
>Trip elbows her boyfriend as Uno raises an eyebrow.
>"The hell were you doin' there?"
>"Uh... we was on a date!"
>Trip sighs as Uno laughs.
>"Heheh!  Shoulda guessed.  You lovebirds crack me up."
>Doc roughly taps the one-tailed fox atop the head with his cane.
>"Oh, quiet, you.  Leave the lovely couple alone."
>Uno grumbles in frustration and runs his head.

>As your destination approaches on the horizon, you keep chatting.
>"So, Dub, Trip; where'd you go for your date?"
>Trip sighs, but smiles a little.
>"Dub took me ta some kinda amusement park.  What's the name, uh... Looneyville, I think?"
>"Wait, really?  Connie and I went there once."
>Connie puts a hand to her chin, then gasps.
>"Of course!  I knew I recognized you from somewhere, Trip; I saw you at Looneyville, from the Ferris wheel."
>"Wait, you serious?  Nice, small world after all."
>The two ladies chat away happily about the amusement park until you get to the restaurant.
>You stop just outside, and Connie clears her throat.
>"Okay... we're not gonna be able to go in guns blazing; this is a public place.  We need to stay calm and blend in.  There's 6 of us, 4 men and two women.  If we pair off, Dub, Trip, Anon and I can slip in and pose as normal couples on dates.  Uno, Mister Quadrain, the two of you can hide somewhere and wait in case we need backup.  Sound like a plan?"
>Everyone nods in agreement, and so you head inside.

>Once you're seated, your attention is drawn to a particularly small table in the rear of the restaurant.
>It's immediately apparent that you're looking at your target.
>Sixpence is clad in a very nice suit the color of wine, with a cravat and monocle topping off his affluent look.
>Like his uncle, he boasts silver fur; unlike Uno, six tails flourish behind him.
>He chats amicably with a waiter before rising from his chair...
>And beelining for you and Connie.
>When he gets close, Sixpence pulls up a chair and sits at your table.
>"New faces, I see!  Always nice, always nice.  I am Sixpence Hexadin, owner and manager of this fine establishment.  Is there anything I can do for you FINE people this afternoon...?"

>You put on a charming smile and try to play things cool.
>"Ah, we'll take two martinis, virgin."
>The fox nods and gestures for a waiter...
>Then slaps him across the temple when he arrives.
>"Well?  You heard them.  Go!  NOW!"
>The terrified waiter dashes off as Sixpence regains his smooth attitude.
>"Now then, will there be anything else?"
>You swallow your anger at his mistreatment of the waiter.
>"Do you mind if I ask you some questions?"
>"Mmm?  I suppose I can spare a few minutes..."
>Connie smiles.
>"Thank you, Mister Hexadin.  And might I say, this is a wonderful establishment you have here."
>He smiles in kind.
>"Why, thank you, Miss..."
>"Volfe."
>"Miss Volfe.  I appreciate a lady with such exquisite taste... though I must insist you remove your hat.  Terribly rude to wear one into such a fine eatery as this."
>Connie's smile becomes more strained.
>"If it's all the same, I would much prefer to keep it on."
>"Nonsense, Miss Volfe."
>Before she can react, Sixpence snatches Connie's hat from her head.  Her pupils narrow as her silver eyes are exposed.
>Immediately she deflates, losing some of her composure.
>"A-ah... may I have that back, p-please...?"
>Sixpence looks positively enamored with Connie's eyes.
>"My goodness... why would you ever want to obscure such wonderful jewels such as those?"
>"P-please, just give it back."
>He absentmindedly lays the hat in his lap, then leans forward, staring at her.
>"My, my.  Very enchanting~"
>Connie seems to grow increasingly uncomfortable with the fox's gaze, and struggles to find something to cover her face with... to no avail.
>"M-Mister Hexadin, please just return my hat..."
>He huffs derisively.
>"I will not.  There is no excuse for you depriving the public of such a lovely visage."

>You'd like to imagine that you managed to keep your cool.
>That you politely informed Sixpence that he should give Connie's hat back, and he understood, then returned it.
>You'd LIKE to say that.
>What actually happened, though... was much different.
>As soon as his last words were out of his mouth, you grabbed him by the throat and dragged him out the restaurant's back door, where Uno and Doc were waiting.  Before they could do anything, you grabbed a wine bottle lying on the ground and beat Sixpence hard enough to make him spit out a few teeth.
>Now, the three of you are surrounding a very terrified and bloody Sixpence, who's barely able to speak.
>"Wh- huh?  Who are you?"
>"That's not important, Hexadin.  What's important is that you should've gave her hat back when she asked.  Now you're answering to me."
>He blinks in confusion and looks over to Uno.
>"U... Uncle Singlair?  What're you doing here?"
>Uno shrugs with a grin.
>"Don't ask me, Six.  You heard the man, you answer to him."
>Now the beaten fox looks to Doc.
>"Doc, you wouldn't just stand by and let this happen, would you?"
>"Well, to my understanding, you mistreated a lady.  So... I daresay that you're getting precisely what you deserve, you mangy cur."
>You bend down and grab Sixpence by the collar before pulling him up to your level.
>"I'm gonna ask one time.  Where's your boss?"
>He quivers in terror.
>"L-Lucky is in a theatre just down the street, incognito.  Ocho is in his office in- in- OH GOD I DON'T REMEMBER WHERE HIS OFFICE IS!"
>Sixpence panics, shaking and barely managing to speak.  You drop him roughly to the ground.
>"If I find Lucky, will she know where Ocho is?"
>"Y-y-yes, she will."
>"Good.  One more thing.  You send so much as a cent Kit's way again and there will be hell to pay."
>"Y-you can't do that!"
>"How are you gonna stop me?"
>Judging by the look on his face, he's not.

>Without so much as a word of thanks, you knock Sixpence unconscious with the wine bottle.  You make your way back to Connie as Uno snickers loudly and steals his nephew's wallet.
>Once you get to her, Connie has already put her hat back on, with apparent relief.  Dub and Trip stand with her, looking concerned.  You nod curtly.
>"Got what we needed.  On to number 7 now."
>Trip's jaw drops.
>"The hell did that come from?  He takes her hat and you go full killer?"
>Connie hugs you tightly.
>"Thank you, Anon..."
>Trip turns to the wolf with a confused look.
>"...and what the heck was up with you?"
>"...I'd rather not talk about it."
>"...alright, whatever.  Not my business.  But YOU!  Anon, I gotta say, I'm impressed.  Plus I finally got ta see that jackass get what he deserved, heh."
>With that, you make your way outside to meet Doc and Uno.
>As soon as he sees you, Doc chuckles and pats you on the back.
>"Well done, old boy.  You stood up for a woman and taught a churlish fop a good lesson.  On top of that, you managed to squeeze some valuable information from him in the process.  Take a bow, Mister Mous."
>Uno nods in agreement.
>"Heheh, that was great.  I've never seen the little bastard get so scared!  Good to know there's a badass lurking in you somewhere, Anon."
>With that, you and your companions head to Lucky's hideout, chatting and laughing about your defeat of Sixpence.

>Once you arrive at the theatre, you kick yourself.
>This is where you came with Aster and Alyssa the other day.  And you remember actually...
>Talking to Lucky, now that you think about it.
>Sure enough, the 7-tailed fox stands behind the ticket counter, beaming at you.

>Unwilling to deal with acting nice, you stroll right up to Lucky...
>Who immediately pulls a pistol from her cleavage, smile never wavering, and points it directly at your head.
>"Let's not do somethin' you'll regret, Anon.  I know good and well why you're here, and I ain't talkin'.  Ocho trusts me for a reason."
>You hear a loud racket as all your companions pull out their own weapons.
>Even Connie sighs before pulling a gun from one of her coat pockets.
>Worryingly, Lucky's smile remains ear to ear, despite being faced with 5 guns aimed directly at her.
>"Well well.  So Quint wasn't full of shit after all!  You two HAVE gone turncoat, huh?  Figures.  I told Kit to get rid of you ages ago, one-tail; same with you, pops.  The two of you?  Small time.  The boss doesn't need the likes of you hangin' around!"
>Lucky quickly ducks behind her counter, then pops up with a shotgun.
>"I so wish I could say it's been nice talking to you guys, but... hell, I'm not one to lie.  You have two options: get out of here alive or in body bags."
>Sweating, you try for a little diplomacy.
>"Lucky.  We just need to know where Kit is.  We don't even have to bring you into this if you just tell us."
>"How fuckin' stupid do you think I am?  Your girlfriend there's gonna bring me down with the boss, just like with Quint and Sixpence.  Same goes for Ocho... who to be honest I couldn't give less of a shit about at this point."
>It's frankly concerning how she never drops the smile, even though she sounds absolutely pissed.
>"Can we just talk?  Just... put our guns down and talk?"
>Lucky giggles maniacally.
>"O'course the unarmed fuckwit wants to call for a truce!  Fine, fine, we'll talk. But I'm not laying down anything, get me?"

>You nod, and Connie turns to the turncoat foxes.
>"Lower your guns."
>They comply hesitantly, leaving only Lucky and the inspector with their weapons raised.
>Lucky giggles again.
>"How touching, leveling the playing field for lil' ol' me."
>You try to smile politely.
>"Lucky, I swear that we don't want to bring you in.  We just want Kit; that's it.  We're not even bringing Quint or Sixpence in."
>"Please.  You've gone around town recruiting, threatening, and straight up beating the hell out of our guys all day.  If this ain't some vigilante shit right out of a movie I dunno what it is.  You're face to face with the biggest arms dealer in the whole damn county, and you're telling me y'ain't gonna bring me in for the glory?  I'm not stupid."
>...you change the subject.
>"Why do you work for Kit if you're a big arms dealer?"
>"Because, idiot, Kit pays me well.  Better than any other client I've ever had.  It's because of that bastard Sixpence, but his money spends as good as anyone else's."
>"How much more?"
>"...enough.  Enough to keep me in this godforsaken operation even while it falls apart."
>"What?"
>"Shit, haven't you been reading the writing on the wall?  How'd you get this far investigating if you ain't noticed things going to hell in a handbag?  ...where'd you get your intel?"
>"You won't tell me anything, why should I tell you?"
>"...fair enough.  Doesn't matter anyway."
>"...Lucky, please.  All we want is to nab Kit.  We never have to mention your name, nobody has to know you were ever involved."
>"I keep telling you, I ain't falling for that!  You're lying to me as sure as Kit's suit is red!"
>Connie speaks up.
>"Anon isn't the detective here.  I am.  I will give you my word that your involvement with Kit will not be reported when we bring him in."
>"..."
>Lucky lowers her gun slightly, looking thoughtful.

>Seeing an opening, you keep Lucky talking.
>"Lucky.  We just want Kit.  If we arrest you, don't you think he'll run?  If we nab you, our actual target gets away.  If we grab Kit and leave you alone, then we succeeded in what we're out to do.  Think of it this way: would you cancel a billion dollar order if someone stopped in and offered a million before you delivered?"
>"...of course not, that'd be fuckin' stupid.  I guess I can see that point... but Kit's still my best customer, and I pay loyalty unto loyalty."
>"You said it yourself: this gang is falling apart.  Why stay on a sinking ship?"
>"I... hm."
>She looks even more thoughtful and lowers her shotgun further.
>"...this organization has gone down the shitter pretty fast, ever since 8-Tail got the idea- err, never mind.  Not important.  What's important is that you got a point, Anon."
>"Besides, Kit's not getting money from Sixpence anymore."
>Lucky's eyes widen.
>"What.  You mean... the funds are dry?"
>"Well, there's-"
>Lucky immediately grabs a phone and dials a number angrily, then speaks in an unnervingly quiet tone.
>"Kit, it's me.  Just got word that your precious investor jumped ship.  You write me my last check now.  We are done here.  I SAID WE'RE DONE!  THE MONEY'S THE ONLY REASON I STAYED WITH THIS ASS BACKWARDS GANG, AND WITH HEXADIN OUT THAT SHIP HAS SAILED!  Send me the damn check.  And it better not bounce, or you're a dead motherfucker."
>She slams the phone down, then blows a hole in the receiver with her pistol.
>Lucky turns to you with an unsettling grin.
>"I think we're done here.  Ocho's office is right down the street, here's his address."
>She hands you a neatly handwritten address with a wink.
>"Blow a hole in 8-Tail's brainpan for me, will ya?  Save me a trip."
>With that, you and your crew set out.  Connie smiles as she quietly holsters her gun.
>"That could've gotten ugly fast, but we managed to get out with no bloodshed.  Well, unless you count the phone."

>As you walk to your destination, you and your team have a good laugh imagining the look on Kit's face when Lucky called him.
>The big boss must be shaking in his boots, seeing as you've nearly pulled his operation out from under him now.
>One last obstacle remains...
>Ocho Octavian.
>Despite hearing the name... you don't know much about him.
>"Say... what's Ocho's deal anyway?  What are we dealing with?"
>Uno shrugs.
>"Never dealt with him for long; seems like a pretty stone cold guy though."
>Dub and Trip nod in agreement.
>"Yeah, never seen the big guy show anything other than ice cold indifference."
>Doc sighs deeply.
>"I have had the misfortune of dealing with Mister Octavian a few times, and I do not particularly care for his attitude.  He behaves far too stoic and distant to properly engage with others, making it nigh-impossible to trust him.  And yet, by virtue of his tails, Master Kit has seen fit to name him second in command... a position I fear he is no longer satisfied with."
>"What?"
>"Mister Octavian strikes me as the sort with great ambitions... and no qualms with destroying anything between him and his lofty goals.  I do wonder if that would include his superior...?"
>"...so we have a stony tough guy who may or may not have dreams of offing Kit and taking his place?"
>"That would appear to be the case, yes."
>Great.  Well, not like he was gonna be a big teddy bear, right?
>Far too soon for your liking, you arrive at the 8-tailed fox's office.
>Connie clears her throat loudly.
>"Everyone... Ocho will likely be the biggest threat we've faced yet.  We'll need to be on our toes, and remain calm.  If we play this right, maybe we can keep things moving without any bullets being fired on either side.  Is there anything we need to do before we go in...?"

>You quietly pull out your pocketknife, then nod... only for Uno to snort.
>"That's all you got?  I gotta say: the fact that you did all the shit you've done today with no gun handy is pretty impressive.  If nothing else, you got guts, Anon. Here."
>The retired conman pulls a pistol from his carpetbag.
>"Take this.  I don't know much about him, but I know Ocho's a tough son of a bitch, and I know you don't need to go in there without a gun."
>You thank Uno, then have everyone prepare their weapons.
>Uno, Dub, Trip, and Connie all pull out pistols with determined expressions.
>Doc grins wildly as he pulls a positively massive knife from within his coat.
>You nod as you watch the team prepare.
>"Alright.  Me and Connie will go in first, and you guys come in if we need backup."
>Everyone nods as you and your girlfriend enter the office...

>Ocho's office is dead silent.  Not even a clock ticks within the depths of the surprisingly well lit lair.
>The entire room is decorated in smart black and white motifs, giving it a pleasant modern look.
>Directly in front of you, behind a sleek, black desk, waits a square-shouldered man you immediately know is your adversary.
>Ocho sits quietly, fingers making a pyramid in front of his snout as he watches you and Connie with a calculating glare.  One cloudy eye bears a deep scar across it, and in fact his entire face bears numerous signs of battle.
>One word comes to mind: "gray".
>Ocho's suit is a rocky gray color, and his fur seems to be graying as well.  Even his good eye is gray.
>He sighs and grabs a bottle off his desk, then takes a long drink before setting it back down with surprising gentleness.
>"...well?  I already know who you are, what you want, and what you've done.  Let's get this over with.  Anon, Connie, sit down."
>Cautiously, the two of you sit opposite the mobster.  He makes no suspicious moves; he merely continues to watch you carefully, then sighs again once you're seated.

>You start to speak, and Ocho holds up a hand.
>"Save it.  You want to know where Kit is.  Million dollar question, huh?  Well, I'm not one to mince words, so let me explain the situation here."
>He leans back in his chair.
>"You see, the boss's latest scheme explicitly forbids me from killing the two of you.  Otherwise?  I do not exaggerate when I say you'd be so full of holes that I could use the both of you as colanders.  But to answer your question, well... I'm not telling you that."
>Connie keeps her cool, but is obviously frustrated.
>"Octavian, it's over.  This organization is through.  Tell us where Kit is and we'll arrest him, leaving you free."
>The fox smiles wearily.
>"...Connie.  Look at me.  How old do you think I am?"
>"...honestly?  About 60."
>He laughs dryly.
>"I'm 40.  See these gray hairs?  All stress.  Stress from dealing with this job."
>He rises from his chair and paces around the room.
>"Stress from managing this organization while Kit fucks around with gimmicks and ignoring the writing on the wall.  Stress from dealing with jackasses like Hexadin and Pentwell just because they fit the tail shtick.  Stress... brought on by one person, and one person alone."
>Ocho returns to his chair.
>"That person?  Kit-o-Nine-Tails."
>He sighs again.  Ocho's voice carries no anger, merely exhaustion.
>"Kit is a useless leader.  This gang has been falling apart since day one under the nine-tailed idiot's lead.  Hell.  One detective and her human boyfriend dismantled the whole operation in one day.  Singlair and Quadrain have been hinting at leaving for years.  Pentwell's rig went up in smoke, along with some very important data.  Hexadin's nursing a concussion, and called the boss blubbering about canceling all future funding.  Septen just called and demanded her last check."
>He manages a weak smile.
>"So.  Now it's just me.  Me and Kit.  Me and the living embodiment of every single mistake a person can possibly make as a mob boss."

>You wordlessly stand up and head for the door; Ocho makes no attempt to stop you. You stick your head out and motion for the others to come in.
>As they do, Ocho simply watches.
>"Ah. The turncoat brigade. I have to hand it to you four. You had the brains to get out of this hellhole before it collapsed. I only wish I made up my mind before it all came to this."
>Ocho stands up and walks over to the window, sighing and staring out of it.
>"...I planned to fix things. To keep this gang together by taking down the one thing keeping us weak: Kit."
>He sighs again and presses his face to the glass.
>"...dammit. I should've made my move sooner. I got too comfortable. Now... all the years of putting up with this shit mean nothing. In one day, over a decade of work went up in flames at the hands of a human. A decade of putting up with Kit's eccentricities, telling myself that there was potential behind them. And there was. At first. Then the quirks got in the way of being a leader. And they never stopped."
>He walks back to his desk and sits down.
>"...I have many regrets in life. The biggest of which is not killing Kit while I had the chance."
>You take the opportunity to speak. 
>"Ocho, it's over. Tell us where your boss is."
>He throws his hands up in defeat.
>"I have no idea. Kit dropped off the face of the fuckin' Otherworld when things started going to hell. Sorry to disappoint you. But, believe me when I say: if I DID know where to find the boss... I'd have already done your job for you."
>"...why am I important to your plan?"
>"...the hell are you talking about. You never had anything to do with this. No, Kit's plan revolved entirely around your girlfriend here."
>Connie's jaw drops.
>"What do you mean?"
>"I don't know. That's as much as the boss would tell me. I should've broke Kit's neck then and there."
>Ocho extends a hand to you.
>"Congratulations. You took down the biggest mob in Elsewhere."

>Ocho sighs with a weary smile.
>"I'm going to turn myself in now. There's nothing left to do. I'm gonna sing like a canary too. If I can get that fucker Kit busted too, then my work will have been worth something. Take care, An-"
>There's a deafening gunshot from behind you, and Ocho drops like a rock.
>You turn to look at the door, and see...
>Bonnie, shakily holding a smoking pistol.
>"...g-got him. I finally got the son of a bitch. Ocho Octavian is dead, and I'm the one who shot him."
>A smile spreads across her face as she steps into the room.

>Panic fills the room as everyone processes what just happened.  Bonnie smiles and looks around, apparently unaware of the confusion.
>Connie eventually speaks.
>"...Bonnie.  Ocho was going to turn himself in.  He was going to spill everything he knew about Kit.  Now, all that information is lost.  Why did you do that?"
>The black fox goes wide-eyed.
>"...ya mean... he was surrendering?"
>Trip snarls and snaps a finger, causing Dub to reach for Bonnie.  The inspector turns her gun on him.
>"Hands off.  I don't care if you're retired or not, DuBois."
>Bonnie strolls to the center of the room and stands above Ocho, casting a ghoulish grin down on him before speaking.
>"I'd say this operation was a rousing success, wouldn't you?  Half of Kit's gang has retired.  Quint Pentwell lost terabytes of blackmail fuel.  Sixpence Hexadin is afraid to drop so much as a dollar on criminal activity again.  Lucky Septen has terminated her contract with Kit.  And Ocho Octavian is stone cold dead.  Only one left to catch..."
>Connie growls quietly.
>"One that we'll never find now because the only person who knew where to find him is dead."
>Bonnie chuckles quietly, then reaches behind her, taking hold of her tail.
>She fiddles with something then removes a small length of string...
>Her nine tails fan out behind her impressively.

>Panicked, Connie points her gun right at Bonnie- no, Kit's heart.  Alarmingly, the villain smiles.
>"Go on.  Do it.  That's what you're here to do.  This is the last step of my final plan.  This is the endgame.  Connie, it's as easy as pulling that trigger.  Do this, and be rid of the worst criminal in Elsewhere."
>Your girlfriend sighs, keeping her pistol trained.
>"...Why?"
>Kit chuckles, a sound that comes off not as mirth, but as the laugh of someone at the end of their rope.
>"Why?  Because I want out.  Do you have any idea how hard it is to live a double life?  I've been both Kit-o-Nine-Tails and this 'Bonnie Vulpin' for years now.  You think that's easy? I used to be at the top of my game; sober, sneaky, and smart.  Then came the problem: you."
>"Me?"
>"Yes, you.  You... you were too much of a real friend to me.  Dammit Con, I love you like a sister.  You're the only person who ever acted like they gave half a shit about me.  And everything you knew about me was a lie.  I betrayed the trust of my one true friend for years..."
>...Kit's eyes begin to fill with tears.
>"...that's what drove me to drink.  It ruined me, Con.  The stress, the alcohol, the guilt of it all.  I went from a ruthless godmother to a broken shell of a woman desperately trying to ignore the writing on the walls.  Ocho had been planning to kill me for months now, and he nearly went through with it this morning.  The only reason I'm glad he didn't was so that I could take him with me."
>Kit slowly walks forward until Connie's pistol is firmly pressed against her chest.
>"So, do us all a favor, Con.  Pull that trigger and end this gang once and for all.  Put a stop to Kit-o-Nine-Tails' reign of terror.  Get the recognition you deserve..."
>The fox trails off.

>Connie shakes her head.
>"No.  I won't do it.  Bonnie... no, Kit, to kill you would accomplish nothing.  All I would be doing would be playing right into your plan.  So, no, I won't kill you.  You're going to pay for your crimes, to suffer like you deserve."
>To your shock, the crime boss bursts into tears, sobbing.
>"Why...?  Con, I'm begging you as your friend.  All I want is a way out.  You're holding exactly what I need, and you'd deprive me of my last wish?  Me, Bonnie Vulpin, your best friend?"
>Connie takes a deep breath.
>"Yes.  You were my friend for years.  But, as you yourself said, it was all a lie.  You only want to play up our friendship so I'll kill you.  I'm not playing your game anymore, Kit.  You are under arrest."
>The nine-tailed fox breaks down altogether.
>"C-Con...!  Please just shoot me, PLEASE!"
>Tears run down Connie's face, but she ignores the black fox's pleas.  She removes a pair of handcuffs from her coat and shackles Kit's hands behind her back.
>"...Con..."
>Connie sighs once more.
>"...Kit-o-Nine-Tails, your organization is through.  It's all over.  You played the long game, and in the end, lost."
>"...n-no I didn't.  Everything went exactly as I hoped.  You demolished the gang so that it would never come back.  The only failure here is the fact that I'm still breathing."
>The mob boss looks over to you now.
>"...Anon.  You were a big help.  Thank you.  ...actually.  Con won't do it, but maybe you can do your old pal Kit a favor...?"

>Kit smiles, tears in her eyes.
>"...just a little favor, Anon.  Easy as point and shoot.  Hell, I'll save you the point half even."
>The cuffed mobster presses her head against the barrel of your pistol.
>"T-there.  Just squeeze the trigger.  Easy breezy."
>You pull the gun away and hand it back to Uno.
>"W-what?"
>"I'm not gonna kill you, Kit."
>There's a long silence as her tears begin flowing harder.  Kit takes a deep, shuddering breath.
>"...why?"
>"Because, I'm not a killer like you.  No, I'm just a window washer.  That's all I am.  And you know what else?  I believe you can change."
>She laughs dryly, no happiness in her voice.
>"Why's that?  I'm a complete monster.  The best thing you can do is kill me.  Put me out of Elsewhere's misery."
>"No.  You hate the life of crime, right?  Then do like these four: reform.  Go legitimate and make up for everything you've done in your career."
>"Why bother?  I've already lost everything else today.  Including my one friend..."
>Connie sighs.
>"...Kit... I agree with Anon.  I know you can change, because you still care enough about our friendship.  If you didn't have a shred of decency, you would've killed all of us instead of just Ocho."
>"...C-Con... I wouldn't... I couldn't kill you.  Uno, Dub, Trip, Doc... I could never hurt you either."
>Kit bursts into tears again, sobbing and becoming unable to speak.

>Tears running down her snout, Connie continues booking Kit.  The resigned mobster continues to sob, occasionally choking out a few words.
>"...w-will you visit me... in jail, Con?"
>"...I will."
>"...thank you, Con."
>Eventually, the police are called, and Connie embraces her friend-turned-nemesis.
>The two women attempt to speak, but Kit breaks down entirely, merely whining and crying every time she opens her mouth to talk.
>Connie also begins sobbing quietly...
>In fact, everyone gets a bit misty-eyed.  Even Uno.
>Kit looks over to you with a sad smile.
>"H-hey.  Treat Con right, okay?  She's the best friend anyone could ever have."
>You nod.
>"I know."
>The mobster smiles and embraces her friend once more, just as the police arrive.
>They take Kit away with no issues.
>She looks back one last time with a teary smile.
>"It's all over.  Good work, everyone.  Enjoy your lives... and stay clean."
>With that parting line, Kit-o-Nine-Tails, also known as Bonnie Vulpin...
>Is gone.
>Connie pulls her hat as low as it'll go before pulling you into an embrace.  Despite the hat, you know she's crying.
>You merely console her quietly for what feels like hours.
>Eventually, you leave the office of the late Ocho Octavian and return to Connie's own office.

>As you slowly walk to the detective agency, Connie sighs and continues to let tears flow down her face.
>"...she was my best friend, Anon. Bonnie was like a sister to me... and she was Kit the whole time."
>Every so often, you simply stop walking and embrace her. It seems to help a bit.
>When you come to a candy shop, you quickly run in and buy a large bag of jellybeans. Connie smiles and does her usual trick, pouring the entire bag into her mouth at once.
>Though she's still clearly upset, Connie treats you to another of those multicolored grins, and the two of you can't help but laugh.

>Once you arrive at the agency, you head straight up to Director Hoardwell. As soon as she sees Connie, the dragoness leaps from her chair and runs for the wolf, embracing her.
>"Oh, Connie, I heard what happened. I'm so sorry. I... I should've figured this out years ago. I'm sorry."
>"It's okay, Director. You couldn't have known. All that matters is that Kit's operation is done."
>The Director shakes her head and squeezes Connie tighter.
>"No. That's not all that matters. YOU matter. How you feel matters to me. If you want time off, take it. Please, just... take care of yourself, Connie."
>Hoardwell releases your girlfriend... then hugs you. Her strength is almost bone crushing, her body extremely warm.
>"Anon, I'm sorry you got roped into this. As a civilian, you should never have been in this kind of danger. Thank you for all your hard work."
>She releases you with a sly grin.
>"I've heard tell that a local detective agency just had a position open up. I think I could put a good word in for a man who helped bring down Kit's mob..."
>You thank her... then remember something.
>"Miss Hoardwell... can you tell me why Connie was assigned to watch me?"
>"Hmm? ...I think you've earned that much. Anon... there is a group in our world. A very dangerous group. We fear they're looking for humans for some reason... and that you were a target."

>"What?  How did they know about me?"
>"According to what we know, you fit a very handy profile for them: you live alone, in a large city where you wouldn't be missed, and near a Door Between Worlds for that matter."
>"Have they already been into my world before?"
>"Yes.  They've sent their... acquisitions officer into the human world several times."
>"Who are they?  What do they do?"
>Hoardwell sighs, blowing black smoke out of the corners of her mouth.
>"We don't know their goals.  All we know is their name: LASH."
>"...does that stand for anything?"
>"We've not been able to determine that."
>"What DO you know?"
>"They're called LASH.  Their base is outside Elsewhere, but in the Otherworld.  They've made use of several Doors in their schemes... They're targeting humans.  They're incredibly dangerous."
>"Why are they dangerous?"
>"That... I can't say. Though I feel you've earned some clearance, I can't talk about that.  Sorry."
>"So, Connie was sent to watch out for me..."
>"Yes, she was.  And it seems she was very successful."
>"What else was she supposed to do?"
>"Study how humans act... get intel on LASH... protect you if it came to it."
>"I see..."

>"What was Kit's plan originally?"
>"Well... according to her own file on the case, it seems that she merely set out to make money and cause chaos.  When she wanted out... she began sabotaging her own gang, ultimately setting Connie on her own trail..."
>"Do you think she was tied to this LASH group?"
>"We think that she may have done business with them a few times, but never became a full member."
>"...okay then.  Miss Hoardwell, thank you for telling me all this."
>You hug the silver dragoness, then embrace Connie warmly.  Hoardwell chuckles warmly.
>"You two head home.  It's late, and you've earned a good night's rest.  Take care."
>You bid Hoardwell farewell, then you and your girlfriend head home to her apartment... 

>Once you arrive, Connie practically snaps your spine with a tight embrace.
>"Anon, thank you.  Thank you for everything.  I love you.  I love you so much."
>She kisses you repeatedly, then sheepishly lets you go when her hat falls off.
>You gently replace the hat, and she hugs you once more.
>Connie yawns deeply.
>"...it's been a long day."
>"It has."
>She smiles drowsily and heads for the bedroom, with you following close behind.
>Connie quietly removes her coat and hangs it up, then burrows under the blankets of her bed.  Once you get changed into your bedclothes, you join her.
>Throwing an arm around your beloved shewolf, you pull her close, enjoying her warm, soft fur.
>Connie smiles, her eyes barely visible under her hat.
>"Goodnight, Anon.  I love you."
>"Love you too, Connie."
>She kisses you sleepily, and the two of you lie there in each other's arms, love and happiness flooding your minds.
>Connie's tail drapes itself over your side as you begin to doze off.
>Murmuring one last declaration of love, you fall asleep next to the love of your life, knowing that tomorrow will be much calmer.
