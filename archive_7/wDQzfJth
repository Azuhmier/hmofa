								Chapter One: A Connection in the Dark

>lost
>lost that is what you were
>why oh why did you listen to your dick head friends?
>tripping on a rock you stumble falling on the cold wet rock of the cave floor.
>Ooof! as you hit the floor a sharp rock digs into your side sending waves of pain over your entire body
>damn if only I could see maybe I could be out of this mess.
>If only, that was now a pointless wish
>if only I had been smart
>if only I had actually thought about what I was doing
>if only...
>Picking yourself up you rack your brain trying to retrace your steps over the past few hours? Days?
> Your memory now as confusing as the cave you were trapped in you continue pressing forward trying to somehow escape.
>walking forward you let your mind wander how long had it been since you had gone up into the mountains with your friends.
>it had been the last day of college and everyone had wanted to spend one last day together before moving on with their lives.
>the idea was to get wasted and have one last loud party without the cops getting involved.
>wasted yes, loud no
>perched on a clearing above the main highway you and your friends had drunk at least two full cases of beer.
>after a while your friends bored of just listening to music had taken to daring each other.
>I dare you to drink two cans of beer at once
stupid shit like that.
> eventually one of your friends had a "bright" idea
>Heyyyyyy AAAAnon I knoooow Their is a caaaave aaaaround here sssomewhere I daaaare youuu to reach the end of it.
>Naaah I just waaaaana chill
>I guesssss yooour a fagggg AAAnon
>Likeeee hellll I aaaaaaam Briaaaan
>Your inebriated mind in all its wisdom had decided at this point to prove Brian wrong.
>after having him show you the cave you had a"ran" in as much as a drunken swagger could be considered running.
>you must have blacked out somewhere inside as you don't remember much after running inside.
>when you woke back up you had no clue where you were, hungry, thirsty, and hanged over.
>you had spent a long time wandering around trying to recall any direction you might have come from getting more and more lost.
>It had felt like a year's worth of time .....
>something ahead quickly takes your mind off your predicament
>was that just a flash of light?
>you start running trying to see where it might be coming from.
>flash
>there it was again
>running you head toward where the light had come as fast as possible your legs aching from the pain.
>then suddenly the ground is gone
>for a split second you tread air like one of those early morning cartoons gone wrong, and then you fall
>It wasn't like a normal fall where it takes seconds to reach the ground.
>this felt much longer and as you continued to fall you felt yourself gaining more and more speed
>5 seconds?
>30 seconds?
>1 minute?
>2 minutes?
C R A C K
>hitting the ground everything seemed to break
>unable to move or speak you sit in pain as your vision slowly begins to fade.
>is this what dying feels like
>flash
>there was that light off in the distance
>mustering all your strength you yell
H..H..HELP!
>the word reverberates all throughout the cave as you hear echos cascade in the distance
>then nothing, and soon after you lose all sense of feeling to the cold that is rapidly spreading through your body
>It feels like an icy bath as more of your body becomes cold and unreachable
>All of sudden you feel warmth as if a fire is spreading across your entire body.
>opening your eyes it looks like a dream everything is fuzzy as a soft light is all around you.
>A massive form is on top of you taking off your clothing.
>you feel a long tongue in your mouth and a great heat around your loins
>Both somehow feeling comforting.
>Waking up you find yourself in a very bright room.
>It smells of disinfectant and chemicals
>once your eyes completely clear you find yourself in the hospital.
>everything seems fine as you look around the room, you spot your grey-haired father and mother sitting on two chairs in the corner.
>your family seemed to have been waiting in that room for a while as you can see dark circles around both of their eyes
>It turns out you had been stuck in that cave for three days.
>the rescuers had all but given up until they found you at death's door near the cave entrance.
>It had been a further two days until you woke up as you had been suffering from extreme dehydration.
>It was now your turn to ex-plane what happened, you tell your parents everything excluding falling down that massive hole.
>you must have somehow blacked out again or was hallucinating.
>After a few hours of sitting and talking the doctor came in and gave you your discharge papers and bill.
>1000 dollars
>"this is gonna be fun to pay" sarcastically pointing to the papers.
>"Well honey you could get your girlfriend to help you out,", your mother replies
>"My what ?!"
> "Your girlfriend Anon don't you remember? she has been freaking out this entire time she has called me or your father at least a dozen times over the past couple of days."
"play it off"
>it sounds like someone just whispered in your ear.
>"did you hear that voice?"
>"what voice honey ?" she asks looking concerned.
"I SAID PLAY IT OFF!"
>The voice seemed a lot louder now and as you were about to ask again, a weird wave of complacency washes over you.
>"sorry I must have heard someone from another room, and yes I do remember now I should probably call her soon"
>the voice was obviously yours but the words weren't it felt like you were a puppet without the puppeteer
> "are you okay Anon?" concern is still written on her face
>you wanted to scream no and tell her something was wrong, but the only thing that came out was "I am I guess this whole situation has really messed with me"
>The concerned expression drops from her face as your "words" must have calmed her.
>"honey I think this has been difficult on everyone including Anon" Your father had chimed in as always calmly and with measured reason." I think the best thing is for Anon to go home and rest. "
>you try fighting this the thing controlling you desperately trying to shout something, anything.
>each second the words feel like they are inching closer and closer to being said, "I... I think  that would be great"
an admirable effort, but don't think you can escape my grasp so easily 
>damn it you were so close
>the feeling of benign pleasure washes over you again as you move off the bed compelled by that unseen force.
>your legs feel shaky and weak as you are forced to stand.
>being forced to dress whatever was controlling you at least lets you close the curtains around yourself for privacy.
>once you are dressed the voice takes full control again forcing you to walk towards the room's entrance.
>you feel like a passenger in your own body as you take one shaky step after another.
>seeing you almost fall a few times your father helps you keep your balance until a wheelchair is brought at the room entrance.
>Unable to move or speak of your own free will you sit thinking about what to do as you are discharged from the hospital.
>Am I going insane?
>is this some sort of bad dream?
You aren't dreaming Anon or going insane.
>great.. it knows your name somehow
>The voice seemed to have a reassuring tone but at the same time a voice telling you that in your head wasn't exactly convincing.
>as you were wheeled to your parent's car every movement you made was controlled.
>every attempt you made to overthrow this control came to no avail.
> each fresh attempt seemed to amuse the voice as you could hear it chuckle.
You humans never learn always trying, but never truly understanding that a task is futile.
>In fury and desperation, you hurl an onslaught of insults at the voice frustrated at your lack of control.
>this seemed to elicit even more amusement as the voice responded in an amused tone.
 Even when you realize that all is lost, all you have left is insults and rage I truly pity the weakness of your species.
>as the voice forces you in the car it leaves you with one final message. 
as much as I enjoy the mental challenge of forcing an insufferable servant to obey me it does get somewhat exhausting and I have other things to do. As long as you play along I won't make it any more painful than it has to be and trust me it can be a lot more UNPLEASANT if you attempt anything.
>as if to emphasize the point you feel a burning sensation encompass your entire body as if your burning from the inside out.
>the pain increases until your about to scream from the agony and suddenly disappears.
>at this point what every the purpose of this voice it was obvious that if it wanted to could kill you in a heartbeat.
>At a loss on what to do you slump in your seat as your father starts the car, and gaze out the window watching the scenery pass
>several points along the journey back to your apartment either one of your parents had tried to start a conversation.
>replying with"yeah" and "uh-huh" seemed to impress on them that you weren't really in the mood to talk.
>pulling up to a huge mansion your parents stop the car.
>confused you ask "why are we stopping this isn't my apartment?"
> "Your apartment? your mother giving you yet another look of confusion speaks up,  "you haven't lived there in six months ever since you moved in with your girlfriend"
>that sharp pain starts creeping back again as you hastily reply, "Sorry I forgot again I don't know what I was thinking."
>with that comment seeming to quell any suspicions you open the door as your father comes around to help you out towards the mansion.
>on the way up the long driveway your father uses the opportunity to strike up a conversation.
>as he does so you are in no mood to respond and it is mostly him talking at you as the mansion gets progressively closer.
>as he rings the doorbell you hear scuffling ... and scratching on the other side.
> as the door opens a busty woman maybe in her thirties comes out dressed in a thick woolen jacket and pants despite the summer heat.
>she embraces you all while crooning "anon" and "honey".
>as she hugs you she whispers in your ear " great job playing along let me take it from here".
> your father unsure of what to do chimes in with a cough," Ahem" the woman looks at him and he continues "Is it all right if I come in Sarah there are some issues I would like to talk about" 
>she replies with an annoyed tone, "not at this moment the house is a mess, and I am sure Anon needs his rest".
> " that's what I wanted to talk to you and him about." Your father looks even more uncomfortable with the tone the conversation was taking, "No offense son, but I have noticed some memory issues you are having and I think Sarah here should be informed."
> Sarah looks both at you and your father very much annoyed.
> Didn't expect that did you "sarah" you say to your self happy at the apparent misstep of whoever or whatever she was.
>to your surprise all she did was lock eyes with your father who's whole attitude changed from uncomfortable suspicion to jovial acceptance.
>Sorry what was I thinking? you two probably have so much to catch up on and we can talk later. 
>Thats fine David, it has been a rather trying time for all of us we can talk later and I will be sure to keep my eye out for any memory issues.
>your father turns and walks away as "sarah" shuffles you inside the dim house.
>as the door closes you watch your parents leave and any hope of being rescued with them.
>you hear a loud rip and you see a large dragoness appear beside you where "sarah" was just standing.
>she was at least six foot five and seemed to be ripping the sweater and jacket to free her lengthy wingspan and tail.
>her eyes glowed auburn orange and deep red as she turned to look at you.
>unsure of what to do you back up and try inching your way back towards the door.
"not ssso fassst anon", she says with a slight hiss as your legs stop moving and refuse to move further
>"what do you want with me "Sarah", you ask rather scared at the very real possibility of harm.
>within seconds the dragoness was on you as felt a scaled hand slap you across the face and pinning you against the wall
>"letsss establish sssome boundariesss" a deep-seated rage emanating from her tone
>her sharp teeth inches away from your face you pull as far away as possible.
>"you will refer to me asss cindar or massster from now on, and you are my ssservant if you quesstion or disssobey me I can and will punisssh you. You will be my ssservant until I dismiss or you have sssatisfied your debtss"
> her hot breath bashing you face and the full weight of her strength pinning you stutter a response, "t...to which debt are you referring?"
>"your life debt asss you would have died without me intervening", she replies casually "and thisss will go along way towardsss repaying it"
>she pins you to the floor and begins slowly taking off your clothing 
>realizing what she was doing you try to resist.
>you can tell she is enjoying your efforts letting you break free just enough to provide you a sense of hope only to take it away a moment later.
S..stop it don't do this its wrong, you stutter desperately trying anything to break free from her pin.
>whatsss wrong with usssing my property asss I sssee fit? she begins taking off her clothing to reveal a dark scaled body and what must be a swollen pussy dripping with fem cum.
>she licks your face with a long tongue and slowly forces your mouth open and kisses you deeply.
>her long tongue eagerly exploring your mouth as her tail wraps itself around you pinning your arms to your sides making you helpless to her advances
> she grabs your member and starts stroking it with her stong, but soft scaled hands 
>each stroke bringing you closer to blowing your load.
>her scales were oddly soft against your skin and her touch gradually became more addicting as she masterfully held you against her.
> you begin moaning despite yourself as she plunges herself on your now throbbing member
>the heat was insane as her folds grasped and massaged your member as she thrust against you creating the most pleasurable pressure.
>were you enjoying this? was a thought that popped into your overloaded mind.
of course, you are anon, it is the nature of humans to want to be dominated, now finish the job
>she began thrusting harder and unable to hold it any longer you release your load and a rush of femcum drenches your lower regions.
>she expertly milks every last drop before pulling you out and embracing you forcing you into ...her boobs?
>not feeling any nipples you are smothered by her "boobs" as she slowly strokes your hair with her deadly sharp claws.
>Overloaded by the stimulus she was providing you lay there breathing in the sulfur smell of her skin as she begins rubbing the small of your back.
>after a long embrace she releases you standing up and walking towards a room at the end of the hallway.
>laying there utterly spent on the cold granite floor she returns with a mop and bucket.
>time to earn your keep Anon here take thisss and clean up the messs you just made.
"MY MESS?!! ", you ask incredulously as Cindar picks you up and hands you the mop 
>she gives you a death stare and immediately you begin to feel pain all over your extremities.
"ok, ok Cindar, Ill do it" as you hastily begin to mop the floor.
>as you do so she goes up the large center stairs in the room leaving you to your business.
> as you mopped up the puddle of femcum the gravity of the situation hit you like a ton of bricks.
>you had just been raped
>you had been raped and had enjoyed the experience.


						Chapter two: Witch Way?
>silence
>it was unnatural not hearing so much as a bird chirp from the outside world.
>The dimly lit room gave an unnatural feel as if the house had eyes and was waiting with bated breath to see what this intruder would do.
>setting the mop down you began to look around 
> as you examining the huge room the smell of sulfur and smoke seemed to reach out and punch you in the gut.
>gagging on the fumes you could barely see a light coming from the top of the stairs.
>Cindar must be up there 
>the thought sickened you, why should you care where this monster was?
>turning around the front door is just a few feet away. 
>A few feet and a door were what stopped you from leaving.
>that and a huge monster who could hurt you without even physically touching you.
>now that you think about it you don't remember it being locked.
>But how far could you get without clothes, much less "it" finding out?
>The unknown of it all was the most unnerving.
>how much influence and control did this "Cindar" have over you.
>Did she... no it have to consciously try to control you or did it have to be actively trying?
> Moving towards the door each footstep echos throughout the room.
>as you put your hand on the doorknob a prickling sense of anxiety falls over you.
>what if she knew, would death be the response for your attempt to escape?
> each second felt like an eternity as your heart pounded in your chest.
Buh Dum
>as you slowly turn the knob the latch clicks back
Buh Dum 
>you begin to pull the door
Buh Dum
>it doesn't budge 
BUH DUM
>pulling even harder it remains firmly wedged shut 
BUH DUM
>putting all your strength behind it the door does nothing but grown from the stress.
BUH DUM
>The only response was a bright symbol appearing on the door.
>before you could get a good look at the sign the handle became red hot forcing you to remove your hand from the door.
>collapsing on the cold floor you listen to your heartbeat defeated
Buh Dum
>nothing is ever that easy 
>well at least you didn't die 
I think that I have given enough time for you to complete your task Anon come meet me upstairs.
>great, now it wants to see you.
>pushing yourself off the floor you start slowly walking towards the stairs.
>each step bringing you closer to that thing who had taken your life away.
>as you climbed the stairs a strange heat seemed to be flowing from the top.
> with each step the air became hotter and the smell of sulfur and smoke stronger.
>reaching the top of the stairs you could see the room in question at the end of a hallway.
>The door was ajar as glowing light and smoke spilled out giving the hallway an alarming look.
>every ounce of your body wanted to run the opposite way, and turning around you slowly started to back away
You really are gonna make me do it myself anon, you humans can be so stubborn sometimes.
>the sense of benign pleasure again washed over your extremities as you yet again became a passenger in your own body .
>too tired to fight it any longer you let her take control.
>as you reached the door you could not help but gag on the fumes that were overflowing from the room
