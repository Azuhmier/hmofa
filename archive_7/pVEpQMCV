>”Get the lead out, Anon! You’d better not make us late!”
>You and Volfa are rushing through the monster station, drawing even more attention than usual
>On top of carrying BOTH your luggage, she keeps several strides ahead of you thanks to her long, powerful legs
>Just two days ago you weren’t sure what your future with the dark wolfess would be
>Now you’re on your way back to visit the human world with her
>She seems even more excited than you
>And of course it’s because of her you’re running late
>The wolfess wouldn’t let go of you while you packed
>”There’s no way your home is cooler than mine,” she sneered as you made the plans, “but I want to see it anyway. Gotta check out the dull life Little Red had before meeting me!”
>Truthfully you don’t really want to stay in the human world for long either
>However, there are still people who care enough about you, and you at least owe them an explanation for your sudden disappearance
>”Just need to make one last stop,” Volfa says, steering you down the hall to “Licensing and Customs”
>Oh, the “little girls’ room” again?
>”You’re lucky I don’t have a free paw, buddy.”
>That doesn’t stop her from ramming into you
>”Anyway, this will only take a sec. I already ‘pre-approved’ everything with the old man yesterday.”
>Indeed, Volfa launched out of her place to see her father and square things away
>It would likely be the last time you ever have to leave her side
>You walk into the office of the massive cerberus, who’s keeping himself busy with calls and paperwork
>”Here you are,” the middle head sighs before you have a chance to even greet him
>He drops a pair of tickets down from his sky-scraping desk
>”Thanks again, pops,” the wolfess says with as much of a salute as she can with the luggage in tow. “We’ll be back in a week or two.”
>”Very well,” the cerberus responds
>As you turn to leave, his booming voice stops you
>”Mr. Anon, a word with you, if I may? Alone?”
>Volfa shoots him a look, as if daring him to try anything funny
>When she’s gone the cerberus puts all his work aside and stands up, giving you a good look at just how colossal he is
>”I’m sure you’ve been given your share of threats from everyone here since your arrival about what will happen to you should any harm come to her.”
>He’s not wrong; that cheery spore mother in Gulchgut got pretty terrifying
>”So I will spare you my own lecture. Instead, I have a request.”
>You expected him to be angry or menacing as he looms over you
>Not somber and soft-spoken
>”Please, take care of my Volfa. I know I haven’t always been there for her, haven’t always been the best father. But, she’s all I have left in this life. I can’t lose her as well. Please, Anon.”
>You didn’t give his desk much attention last time, but now you notice a much larger version of the picture that hangs in Volfa’s room
>A three-headed canine and a human woman, love in their faces
>You nod to the cerberus
>You promise to let nothing bad happen to her
>”Thank you for understanding.”
>He turns to stare at the wall
>”You may go. Have a safe trip.”
>The middle head keeps looking directly forward while the flanking two each pull out handkerchiefs, dabbing their eyes and noses
>When you return to Volfa she gives you a suspicious look
>”He better not have been too hard on you.”
>You just shake your head

>Through the station and into the sedan that brought you to the monsters’ home you go
>The driver is trying to hide his exposed muscle tissue with the mask of a saggy old man
>”Tickets, please.”
>The ride doesn’t feel nearly as long now that you’re not anxiously waiting to see your love again
>And yet, you almost wish the ride would be longer so you can continue spending such a peaceful moment with Volfa
>Her energy and willingness to have a good time are legendary, but even in complete silence you can feel her force of presence
>In the rear-view mirror you see some life in the driver’s face as he cracks a smile at the happy couple
>You look from him to the glamour of Volfa’s jeweled choker: you’re not sitting beside a wolfess, but a dark-haired human
>She’s no doubt a beautiful figure, one that is so similar to her mother’s that it’s no wonder her father fell in love with a human
>But all the while you see the illusion it just makes you more determined to always look at Volfa with your own two eyes
>No doubt a deliberate flaw in the glamour’s design from that sly apothecary to keep lovers’ gaze on the one who matters most
>Good move, Medafet

>You arrive back at your hometown in the evening
>Things look too boring already compared to the monster world
>Volfa easily reads your demeanor
>”Come on, I was just messing with you before. I’m sure it’ll be a good time!”
>You hadn’t even given much thought into who to visit or where you’ll even be staying
>Some friends and family would likely take you in, but there’s still something holding you back from introducing your wolfess girlfriend of one week to them
>”Well, if you’re giving up already, I think I have a place in mind,” Volfa says
>Sure enough, there’s a place hidden in the city that only someone like Volfa could find
>And much like the secret catacombs you were spirited away to over a month ago, the buildings around you seem to shift to give access only to those who need it
>There’s a stonework concierge inside for the single room he guards, though you wouldn’t be surprised by now if that room is some kind of weird extra-dimensional space
>”We can stay with your family sometime, don’t worry,” the wolfess says as she tosses the luggage inside, “but here’s our little getaway when we need some extra…privacy.”
>Well, it’s definitely cozy
>One bed, a few tables and assorted furniture, a bathroom, and a small hearth for warmth
>She reaches into a dresser and tosses you something
>It’s a stack of bills
>Holy…
>That’s a lot of money
>”Nobody beats us when it comes to Halloween. Nobody. We make bank off you guys every year from costumes and party stuff, and it’s enough to spread around to anyone who needs it when they come to visit.”
>So, how many other monsters are even allowed to freely walk around when it’s not Halloween?
>”Not many, so don’t blow this for us.”
>Volfa grabs the stack and playfully slaps you in the face with it
>”You saw how uptight the old man was about me coming here. Now, imagine if you don’t have a magical disguise choker, or good ol’ nepotism to help you out. At most you’re leasing a closet space in some small child’s bedroom.”
>She flips through the wad of bills with her claw
>”Not saying we should be wasting all this on ourselves, but I’d like to see the best of what you think the humans have to offer, you know?”
>She tucks the money into your crimson jacket and gives it a little pat
>”Just remember, when we’re back at ‘home’ home, you won’t need any of this. I’ve got everything I need over there to take care of you, Little Red.”
>You have the freedom to do practically anything
>Though despite what Volfa said about seeing “the best” of the human world, you get the feeling she just wants to do what you enjoy most
>Whatever makes you happy
>”Remember, I’m ‘Vee’ when we’re here,” she says with a nudge
>Right, “V for Volfa”?
>”Hey, I didn’t come up with it myself. My old man thought it would work if he ever had to bring me here with him.”
>Wait, the cerberus expected to bring her here himself?
>Volfa is mum on the subject

>You take Volfa to your favorite hangouts and restaurants
>You go to typical dating spots like theaters, museums, make-out spots…
>For only being allowed to visit the human world once per year, she already knows how most things seem to work
>It’s not really showing someone around who has never seen “civilization” before, but rather showing someone around when they’ve only seen the place at night
>At first you’re on edge just walking around in public with her
>Nobody else can see her the same way as you do, but it takes some adjustment time to have a large anthropomorphic wolf walking with you down the street
>Like being naked on the “safe” side of a one-way mirror
>Every so often you’ll be in the city when Volfa and a random stranger make eye contact
>The two exchange nods, then go about their ways
>Friend of hers?
>”Heh, no idea who he is, but you should know better than anyone what comradery us monsters have.”
>She might be selling humans a little short, because your family accepts Volfa immediately
>Though she might just have some kind of power over people like that
>Still, she isn’t spared the same kind of, “Don’t do anything to hurt him,” warning you’ve gotten several times already from her own people 
>She takes it in stride, making sure to give them plenty of cues as to just how much she loves you
>The only thing she holds back is your nickname
>Medafet made a good observation: she really doesn’t ever use it except when she’s alone with you
>You’re met with no resistance when you try explaining to your folks you’ll probably be living with “Vee” most of the time, but you’ll come home to visit everyone occasionally
>Speaking of which, your friends are awestruck by Volfa
>”Where did you even find someone like her?” they say
>When you’re feeling snarky, you tell them the complete truth:
>She met YOU when the rest of the group abandoned you for some crappy Freak Fair ride
>The guilt of their past deed doesn’t outweigh their jealousy
 >Of course Volfa is the instigator type, rubbing it in with her public displays of affection
>”I really got the best one to be my Little Red,” she says to you in private

>You’re really looking forward to New Year’s Eve
>You’ve already bounced between worlds a few times, but you persuaded her to stay on the human side at least for the end of the year
>Knowing how much Volfa loves to party (and drink), you bet it’s going to be her second favorite holiday by far
>So it’s a bit of a shocker when she’s completely disinterested in going out for the celebration
>”You know, there’s something we really don’t do often enough, and I’d like to make up for lost time.”
>The two of you are back at the hideaway with a cozy fire going
>At first you think she’s just being sensual and getting in the mood
>That can’t possibly be what she was talking about given how blunt she is about her sex
>And how hard you rock the bed most nights
>”Come over here, big guy,” she says, sitting up against the couch
>Not even ON the couch, but right on the floor in front of it
>She pats the empty spot beside her and you take a seat
>Once settled she wraps an arm around your shoulder and pulls you in snugly
>You expect something big to happen, but it never does
>You’re soon wishing nothing ever does
>She leans her head against yours, stroking the back of your neck and massaging your scalp with her gentle paw
>You pay her back, running your fingers through her dark, smooth pelt
>Your free hand interlocks with hers
>There’s no urgency, no worries, no deadlines to dread
>Just watching the flickering hearth in your shared room, removed from the rest of the world for a moment
>She eventually leans into you too much, and you end up on your side with her pressed up behind you
>Her arm is draped over your body, and her legs over yours
>Your head is resting in the crook of her neck; its plush fur billowing over you just enough so you can savor her earthly aroma
>Your front is warmed by the fire while everything else is covered by your wolfess
>Her paw rubs your chest in slow circles
>You can hear the occasional thumping of her tail on the floor, when you’re not completely absorbed in the flow of her deep breathing
>Breathing that soothes you with a tranquilizing rhythm
>Your only wish in this moment is to see her face as she protects you with such a caring embrace
>Her chest heaves into your back before she lets out a drawn-out sigh
>”I don’t think I have the energy to make it to the bed tonight,” she chuckles
>Neither do you
>The fire stays with you until you can’t keep your eyes open any longer, then it excuses itself little by little
>”Love you…” Volfa whispers before drifting off to sleep
>It’s amazing how the floor can feel better than any mattress, as long as you’re in the arms of the one you love most

>October 31st
>Your one-year anniversary with Volfa
>The whole gang is back together at Freak Fair, with the addition of the wolfess
>This time, SHE’s in the red cloak while you’re wearing the nightgown and a cheesy wolfman mask
>The guys make sure to keep close to you, thinking your good fortune from last year is going to rub off on them
>Unlike last year, you’re in the FRONT of the line for the same ride you first met Volfa on, Turmoil of Loathe
>You’re not a single rider anymore, either
>When the ride’s over the two of you have a head start before the guys get off to escape for the “real” entertainment
>”Are you sure you don’t want them to come along?” the wolfess says
>You’ve thought about it; you’re sure a few of them would love the monster world
>But some selfish part of you wants to keep it a secret, if only for a little while longer
>”Yeah, I don’t blame you,” she says. “Remember how little I trusted you at first?”
>Like you’d forget ANY part of that night
>”I hope you saved my little memento from the next morning!”
>Even the dark, twisting road to the catacombs somehow feels the same
>Before you know it, you’re tossing aside your costume in the catacomb foyer
>Volfa hands you her cloak
>Your cloak
>”You know the drill, Little Red,” she winks. “It stays on until I rip it off!”
>The place is the same is how you remember it, only this time the monsters are more accustomed to the sight of you
>You run the gauntlet of festivities first, at Volfa’s request
>The two of you are shaking things up a bit by doing everything backwards
>When you take a breather, you’re back at the bar just leaning on the counter and slamming some pretty hair-raising drinks
>Everyone else is genuinely having a good time as well, and not standing around like they’re just here to be decoration
>”This is so much better,” Volfa sighs. “I feel like a real dumb pup for trying to force things back at the mausoleum….”
>You rub her back, and she does the same for you
>You spot a few human girls mixed in with the crowd, dreamy smiles and blissfully unaware of what exactly they got themselves into
>”Poor things probably won’t have a single memory of this tomorrow.”
>Volfa does a click with her tongue
>”You might have to consider bringing your friends next year. Getting kind of tired of seeing only the dude monsters have fun with the humans.”
>Looking back at ditching your friends, you hope they can still have a good night on their own
>Everyone deserves to have their own Volfa
>You’re pulled under her arm affectionately
>”Not like I should be sweating stuff like that. After all, my old man met the love of his life at a party just like this.”
>A human woman, stolen away for a night of merriment, likely having no idea she’d be the mother of a snarky wolf child
>”It was him who pushed so hard to organize this one night of freedom for everyone, even getting a shitty desk job just to keep our two worlds connected.”
>Guess it wouldn’t be completely the same with Volfa if she didn’t have a moment of reflection like this
>”And I was kind of a brat to him all those years, breaking the rules all the time and almost ruining things for everyone….”
>The sooner she gets it off her chest, the sooner you can get back to the revelry
>You give her a kiss on the muzzle, and you get a lick in return
>”This is why you’re my wingman!” she laughs. “You keep me looking at the best of things!”
>She stares at you with those golden eyes
>First with a dopy grin, then a more seductive one
>”Always the best things…” she hums
>You go back to people watching for a while, until Volfa clears her throat
>”Speaking of family…”
>You wait for the rest, but she just pauses
>Every so often her mouth opens to find the words
>Then she balks and goes silent for a while longer
>”Hey,” she finally says, “wanna go upstairs for a bit? Managed to get the same room and everything! We can come back to all this later, if you want.”
>Volfa reaches for two empty glasses and a bottle of wine before leading you to the higher levels
>Up to the apartments protected from the humans milling about on the streets below
>A beautiful sight of the city flooding you with nostalgia as you look out the sloped window
>In a room that seems completely untouched since last year
>All that’s different is a wooden box sitting on the table
>Lid open, with two vials on full display
>One red, like your lucky cloak
>One gold, like her mesmerizing gaze
>”I know I’ve talked about it before,” she says, “but I thought maybe I’d plant the idea in your head again.”
>She takes your silence as encouragement to continue
>”We might be an inseparable, wild pair, but someday we’re going to want to settle down for a bit, right? I think my old man was on to something in that regard.”
>She pops the cork, and it sails across the moonlit window
>”Gotta get some new goals when you think you have everything you want, ya know? What I want now is to see what kind of little bastards we can make together.”
>As she pours the wine, you think you can see the liquid in the vials twinkling in the corner of your eye
>”And if we want some alone time, I’m sure we can get someone to watch the pups. Obviously there’s my old man, but recently I heard there’s also a sweet little apothecary back home who knows how to handle troublesome wolf pups.”
>Well, if Medafet indeed taught Volfa what she knows about messing with people, “troublesome” would be softballing it
>”But, this is all for when you’re ready, Little Red. I’m not the type of girl who just rushes you into things, am I?”
>There’s that impish tongue of hers sticking out at you
>Volfa hands you your glass, then hooks your arm with hers
>There’s no doubt she’s going to have you under the sheets before midnight, but you’re content just staring into her eyes until that time comes
>”Happy Halloween, Anon.”
