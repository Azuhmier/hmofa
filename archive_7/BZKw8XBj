>Houses lazily pass by as you carefully drive through your neighborhood.
>Little kids and cubs run around on the sidewalks, on the front yards or your neighbors who are standing outside watching them.
>You wave to a few of the friendlier neighbors and then pull into your driveway.
>Clicking the remote on your garage door, you're a bit surprised to see a car already parked in there.
>Dalia must have gotten off work early.
>And she took your usual spot.
>She is a lawyer with the BHA and if she has no cases she sometimes gets off.
>You smile as you get out of your car and walk through the garage, closing the door as you enter your house.
>A cheerful tune fills the air and you hear happy chirping going along with the rhythm.
>She must be in a good mood to be chirping so much.
>However as you walk through the hallway, one thing stops you dead in your tracks.
>The smoke detectors battery has been removed
>That can only mean one thing...
>She decided to try cooking.
>Again.
>You rush to the kitchen and find Dalia, a slender Serval Anthro wearing jeans, a white shirt and an apron, happily slapping small crabs with a large wooden spoon.
>It looks like she tried to fry a dozen small live crabs in a frying pan, only to have them crawl out of the pan.
>So she is slapping them back in with the wooden spoon, chirping happily all the while.
>You stare dumbfounded for a moment before moving quickly to grab a lid and place it over the pan right as Dalia slaps the last crab back into it.
>Dalia is actually a great cook, the only problem is she's a little....derpy in the kitchen.
>One time she tried to make fondue with a chocolate bar, but just set the chocolate in the pan.
>It just burned and stuck to the bottom of the pan, and you had to get rid of the pan all together.
>Another time she tried to make a pizza, but left it on the cutting board when she put it in the oven.
>That one was fun to clean up.
>"Honey! I didn’t hear you come home!" Dalia happily chirps, dropping the spoon then wrapping her arms around your neck.
>She gives you a quick kiss and smiles.
>"I'm making dinner tonight! You usually do so I wanna give you a break" she says happily as she breaks away from you to tend to a boiling pot.
>"Uh huh... What are you making love?" you ask tepidly, peering over her shoulder.
>"Soft shell crab Udon! My coworker, Ginger the momonga anthro, gave me a recipe and I just HAD to try it" she responds, stirring a pot of what you assume is broth.
>You peer around the kitchen and see various food stuffs.
>Eggs, green onions, those little things with the swirls that one would see in ramen bowls.
>What were those called again? Narutomaki?
>Whatever.
>But you don’t see any cook book or see her checking her phone on how to make this meal.
>"Dalia darling, where's the recipe?" you ask as you begin poking around the kitchen, noting a few bottles knocked over (Probably from her tail).
>Dalia’s ears perk and her tail poofs a bit as one of the crabs in the pan pop as she looks around the room questioningly.
>"Its uhhhhh... Over there!" she responds cheerfully, pointing with her spoon.
>You look to where the utensil is pointing and see a piece of paper half submerged in a puddle of soy sauce.
>Gingerly you pick up the paper and give her your best "really?" face.
>She just smiles, showing her long fangs and goes back to cooking.
>Sighing, you pick up the sauce soaked paper, looking at the barely legible handwriting.
>The whole piece of paper is stained dark brown, but still probably salvageable.
>Maybe.
>You grab a handful of paper towels and lay them flat on a clear part of the counter, then place the recipe on them.
>Gently you fold a few paper towels over the recipe and then press down, feeling the soy sauce soak into the paper towels and in-between your fingers.
>After a few moments, you lift your hand slowly from the recipe, checking to make sure it’s still intact.
>Success!
>The paper has most of the brown liquid drained from it, but is still a bit soggy.
>That isn’t important though because the recipe is still legible.
>as you scan the directions, you hear your wife moving around busily, hopefully following the directions.
>"YA!" you hear from Dalia as you read the instruction "Put the udon noodles into boiling water"
>"YEET!"
>An almost explosion of hot water cascades around the kitchen as Dalia slam dunks a package of noodles into a pot of hot water.
>For fucks sake, you told her slang is NOT to be used in cooking, and you don't even know where she learned that.
>Plus you're sure she doesn't even know what that means.
>You sigh, and smile at Dalia; who is happily tending to the noodles in the pot.
>The water on the floor to her is just a normal occurrence at this point.
>"Alright then, how can I help" you ask, trying hard not to deflate Dalia's happiness.
>Dalia's ears twitch and her tail poofs slightly as she looks around the mess what was once your kitchen.
>"Uhhhh...Watch the crabs! They are soft shelled!" she chirps hesitantly, pointing at the pan of small crabs with her spoon.
>You nod and get a pot holder, then stand by the pan.
>From the sound of it, the crabs have been thoroughly cooked.
>You lift the lid off the pan and look in to check the progress.
>Luckily (Unluckily for them), no crabs have survived and are now fried in sesame oil.
>It honestly smells delicious, and you're quick to remove the fried crustacean from the heat in fear of overcooking them.
>Dalia is stirring the noodles merrily, still chirping along to the beat of a song on the radio you don't know.
>You watch her calmly, her tail wiggling side to side with the music, her cheerful chirping.
>In that moment you know for sure that despite her...interesting cooking attempts; you love her through and through.
>How could you not fall in love with this woman?
>Sure she makes mistakes, but she is only human...Err...an Anthro.
>Whatever.
>She does her best to make you happy and that’s what matters.
>You monitor her as she prepares the rest of the meal.
>Although you do stealthily check under the sink to see if the fire extinguisher you bought is there. 
>She doesn't consult the recipe at all, and occasionally you have to remind her of the steps for what ingredient goes in when, but all in all she makes the meal.
>Although she said she was cooking to give you a "break", this was more stressful than just cooking yourself.
>Again, you do appreciate her trying, but it was like trying to a toddler from touching the stove over and over.
>You assist her in chopping the soft shell crab legs; and directing them into the broth of noodles, fishcakes and noodles.
>Her smile is what makes all this worth it.
>As she (and you) put the finishing touches on the meal; she has a huge happy and proud smile.
>She made something new for you both, and even IF you had to watch over her; it was another good bonding experience.
>"Bon app-a-tit!" she says merrily as she presents you with a bowl of delicious smelling udon, complete with the soft shell crab legs and fish cakes.
>You take the bowl and don’t bother correcting her wording as you take the bowl to the kitchen table, then wait for her to join you.
>She fills a bowl for herself and sits next to you, beaming at you as you try the meal she made.
>A quick sip of the broth tells you she made another masterpiece; albeit with SOME mistakes.
>"Good?" she asks apprehensively.
>You spoon a mouthful of broth and noodles into your maw for an answer, then nod with a few crab legs sticking out from between your lips.
>Dalia giggles at this display, then digs in herself; occasionally letting out a happy chirp.
>Luckily this meal turned out good, but there are still all the other times things went horribly wrong.
>But those don't matter as you loudly slurp up a long udon noodle and stare at Dalia while you do.
>She gives a happy chirp and swats you with her paw playfully.
>"Table manners!" She says through a mouthful of food, which makes her giggle.
>You swallow your food and give her a loving smile.
>"Love you Dalia, thanks for the meal" you say, wholeheartedly meaning it.
>She gives you a smile that could light up a dark night, one that confirms why you married her.
>"Love you too! You get dishes still though!" she chirps, pointing into the kitchen.
>Your heart sinks as you think back to the messy kitchen...
>This is why you normally cook.
>"Fine, but you're mine later" you respond, reaching under the table and squeezing her thigh.
>She jumps slightly, then lets out a long seductive purr.
>"Deal"
