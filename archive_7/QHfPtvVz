>She was gone a while
>A long while
>"Just a quick get together with the girls," she said
>"Won't even down a jug, promise," she continued
>But now, hours later, Anna was still nowhere to be found
>You repeatedly told yourself a girl of her size and stature would be fine
>But you still worried about what dangerous situations she could get herself into
>Actually, it was probably best you worried for other people's safety due to her size
>Regardless, she still wasn't home yet and it was long past dark
>You would occasionally get up from the couch to peek through the windows in hopes of seeing her
>Nothing, every time
>You tried calling her earlier, but it was a lost cause once alcohol entered the equation
>All that you could do now was wait
>And wait
>And wait
>And... You let out a small yawn
>The television was starting to lose your interest as you got comfortable on the couch
>A loud bang startled you up from nearly relaxing into sleep
>A few more repeated bangs came, then a few taps
>You rub your eyes and your mind finally comes to the conclusion that it they came from the front door
>Carefully, you peer into the door's peephole
>A slouched black figure was on the other side, which you could faintly hear muttering
>You sigh and unlock the door
>The person on the other side fumbled with the door knob for a bit before laughing loudly
>You decide to help the drunken character by opening the door with ease
>Anna nearly falls on top of you
>Had she not been vaguely gripping on the doorframe, there was a good chance you'd be buried under a ton of dog girl
>Her bright green eyes hazily make contact with yours
>"Hey 'Non, I'm hoooome," she slurs with another giggle
>She props herself back up and drops the bottle of beer she had in the process, causing it to clatter loudly on the floor
>You breathe relief when it doesn't shatter
>"Anna," you say, "what the hell took you so long?"
>Her face contorts, attempting a bad mixture of happy and annoyed
>"Nothin', I'm right on time," she lies
>The dog woman takes a step forward and you can see how out of place her whole outfit has gotten, showing off a good amount of her physique
>Bits of her mottled black and brown fur is also matted in a few places
>Another step and she nearly tumbles, but you manage to prop her back up with all of your strength
>You pull down her shirt and straighten it out
>Anna shakes her head, "No, no, the other way dummy."
>She leans down to your eye level
>You can smell the alcohol on her breath
>"Other waaaaaay," she says and gives your face a lick
>While you would usually be in the mood for her sloppy kisses, this wasn't really a good time
>"Anna, come on, you can't keep doing this," you say as you shut the door behind her
>"Won't happen anymore, promise," she gives a comical frown and puts her hands together in a mock plead
>"Yeah? Just like your promised not to get so wasted, right?"
>"Never said that"
>"You said 'no jugs'"
>"Right, no jugs, just a lotta' cans," she says with a toothy grin
>You let out an annoyed grunt
>"Well, come on, let's get you cleaned up," you say, pulling her along
>"Y'know, I was thinking a lot on my way over here"
>"Yeah?" you decide to indulge her
>"Yeah"
>"...Yeah?"
>"Yeaaaaah"
>"About what?" You manage to guide her giant form into the hallway
>She comes to a stop, ignoring your pitiful tugs on her arm
>"About this," she says as she leans into you again, giving you a long kiss on the cheek
>"Oops, I missed"
>She drags her tongue across your cheek before reaching the entrance of your mouth, where it promptly works its way against your tongue
>Her usual taste was clouded with odd flavors of several foods and the obvious cheap beer, but just a little sliver of her was more than enough to set you off
>Anna pulls away and adds "And this"
>She snakes a furred hand down your trousers and grasps your member
>Her large hand practically envelopes the entirety of your genitals
>The dog girl can feel you growing more erect
>"Hah, gotcha," she cheers
>She continues to poke and prod at your groin inexpertly, but you still let out a gasp or two inadvertently
>Her other arm wraps around your waist and before you know it, you're hoisted into the air
>With you in hand, she turns around and heads for the couch, continuing to drunkenly pleasure you
>It isn't until you're actually on the couch that you realize where you are
>"No, wait," you say as she prepares to unzip her fly. "Not the couch!"
>She lets out a small whine
>"The bed, the bed!" you urge, fearing for your upholstery's life
>Quicker than you expected, she pulls you off the couch and rushes to the bedroom, fortunately without any problems
>Anna gives you a quick hug, burying you in her fluffy chest before tossing you on the bed
>It was a patented "Big-R Strong-R" bed that managed to withstand most of the rigorous breeding
>It didn't help the house much, as evidenced by the scratches on the wall and floor
>Within seconds, Anna's pants flew off, leaving her chest disappointingly covered
>You scramble to remove your undergarments before she practically tears them off
>The dog girl climbs onto the bed and begins to grind her groin into yours wildly as soon as she straddles you
>"I was thinking about this for a long while," she says between frantic humps
>"Slow down!" you manage to say
>She snaps at the air with her mouth as her hips come to a hesitant stop
>Her arousal begins to drool onto your cock
>Carefully, you work your hand down to your dick and begin to position it against her
>She begins to bare her teeth in frustration
>"Are you done?"
>"Ye-" she cuts you off as her whole body comes slamming back down onto you, enveloping your member in her warm folds
>She lets out a few barks mixed in with moans as the whole bed begins to shake and bump into the walls
>Your own stoic façade begins to break down as she rides you, letting out a few moans of your own
>Through the fog of rapid sex, you manage to work your hand underneath her shirt and into her bra while she looks down at you with ravenous eyes
>She continues to slam down onto your dick as you shakily fondle her breasts, evoking a number of breathy moans to her already vocal pleasure
>Hungry for more, she tosses off her jacket and shirt in one impressive motion, leaving her barely covered tits shaking about
>In conjunction with the repeated jostling of the bed, her tail starts to bang against the top of the mattress in excitement
>You couldn't have picked a louder lover if you wanted to
>You begin your own set of thrusts against her, but timing against her crazed humps is somewhat challenging
>Eventually, both of you get the hang of it as she calms down a little from her high
>The creaking, the moaning, the slamming, the small slaps of flesh all continue on into your love making
>She bends down from her riding position, forcing your head into her tits while she grabs at your hands
>At best you can occasionally lick at a nipple when it moves into position, but it's clear she's mostly interested in pleasure from your cock
>Anna begins to pepper colorful words into sex, from simple swears to lovey dovey mush
>Probably the most interesting of which being, "Fucking love me."
>Her stamina begins to wane a little, forcing her whole body to move against you is quite tiring
>You notice this and, through the breasts that are nearly smothering you, you manage to say "Roll over."
>Obediently, she turns over and you find yourself thrusting on top of her
>Her tongue lolls out of her mouth as you pound into her
>Your thrusts certainly aren't as forceful as hers, but you make the effort and force the bed frame to shake somewhat
>Her barks and yaps descend into tired breaths
>Both of Anna's ears start to twitch
>It was so cute, but also a good way to know when she was reaching an orgasm
>Which was right about now
>Anna tried to pull you closer, even though you were right on top of her, essentially just squeezing you
>Her hips began to thrash and soon, she let out an ear splitting howl that took a while to wind down
>The dog woman's cunt flexed wildly, pushing you into your own edge
>Maybe you joined her in her howling, maybe you didn't, it was hard to tell at that point
>What did matter, is your pleasured cock as it spasmed in her warm depths, depositing your seed into her
>Even though you were both spent, Anna's hips still tried to move against yours before realizing the event was over

>"See, this is why you have to cut back on drinking, Anna," you said to her in the shower
>You were halfway through cleaning out her knotted fur where beer had stained it
>Anna rubbed soap into your body, nonchalantly saying, "Yeah, yeah, alright."
>A loud knock came at the front door
>Anna rolled her eyes and asked, "What now?"
>"Probably about the noise."
>"Noise?"
>"You know, your howling, you get pretty loud when you're into it."
>"I don't howl while fucking!"
