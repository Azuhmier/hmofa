Summary: You've never really 'fit in' with the heavily divided Ranchview High School crowd. Jock, Goth, Prep, Cheerleader, Nerd...you were never any of these. But as Halloween approaches, strange things start happening, and a dark ritual begins with the finding of a curious red book. It's a race against time for you and your friends to stop a group of students from ushering in an age of darkness, and to also figure out just what the hell is wrong with that rabbit.

>Wednesday morning
>Your eyes crack open
>You feel Sam against you, his form is as familiar as your own clothing at this point
>WOW he feels warm, even through your clothing
>Like a little ball of magma clinging to you
>What time is it?
>You check your phone
>It’s only 6:30 a.m.
>That explains the lack of light showering in from the crucifix-shaped window
>You have another hour-and-a-half before school
>You stretch out delicately as Sam shifts, his leg kicking, snared in a dream
>Dawww
>Usually when one of your friends falls asleep on you, you feel mildly uncomfortable
>But this is not like one of these times
>It just feels right to have him next to you
>Alex snores away like a bulldozer crushing a field of glass bottles
>You’re about to shut your eyes again when you hear someone moving around on the old wooden bench
>You turn your head
>Jenna is up and moving, smoothing her sweater, running her paws through her unkempt fur
>She must not notice you, because she starts licking at her arm, smoothing it out with her thin, pink tongue
>You wonder what it’s like to groom yourself with your tongue
>It’s like always having a brush on hand!
>Part of you wants to try, but the lucid part of you knows how disgusting that would be
>Jenna turns to start on her other arm and bends her neck low to reach her thin wrists
>When your eyes meet
>…
>You swear, you can almost hear the little voice inside Jenna screaming with shame
>The vixen glows beet red 
>She tries to play off her grooming as her smoothing out the fur on her arm, briskly running her paws across her fur, back and forth
>Ruffling and un-ruffling
>”Morning…” she whispers, still glowing red
“Were you just-”
>”NO!” Her voice rings out in a thin staccato, fueled by embarrassment
>She catches herself quickly and claps a palm over her muzzle
>Sam shifts his body and mumbles something you can’t hear
>Whatever
>Not a big deal. You’ve been caught picking your nose plenty of times
>Jenna points to the exit doors of the church
>Immediately you know what she wants

>Untangling yourself from Sam is more of a challenge than you expected
>You worm your way away from him, trying to get him to lean against the back of the pew instead of on you
>Gravity has other plans
>The bunny slides downward, his head landing directly into the crook of your lap
>…Right on your-
>Yeah
>You flush red and stifle a frustrated groan that swells in your throat
>Fucking hell
>Now what do you do?
>You look to Jenna, desperate for help
>But the vixen is fucking useless
>She’s bent over, fighting the giggles
>You can hear each one of her fits pop inside her mouth like little balloons
>Foxes and their gekkering
>You blush even harder as your eyebrows slope downward into a viscous scowl
>Which makes you just look constipated
>And makes Jenna laugh even harder
>When you get out of this you swear you’re going to tell everyone she still licks herself to groom
>Don’t most mammals grow out of that?
>Whatever
>You still gotta get Sam off
>…
>OF YOU
>Not ‘off’
>Fuck
>You slowly, very slowly, slide his head over your thigh
>You plunge your hands into the tangles of his hair and fur, holding him in place so when you slip out from under him, his skull doesn’t smack the hardwood of the pews
>He feels INSANELY hot to the touch
>His body radiates warmth like a tiny little engine
>If Sam were an engine, he’d be a dirtbike or something
>You bite your lower lip
>Shit
>What if he’s getting sick?
>With all of this going on, the last thing you need is a sick bunny
>Before school you’ll go to the store and get him some medicine
>But he NEEDS to be in class
>You’re not going to ruin his life and get him expelled for absences
>You’ve already ruined his life in one way
>If he makes it out of this alive, you’d rather not have it ruined academically
>Here goes nothing
>You gently lift his head
>Slide out underneath him
>And then lay gingerly back down on the pew
>As if he were made of delicate glass
>That dumb little bun just curls in on himself and doesn’t seem to even notice you’re gone
>When you stand up, you have to brush off the stray strands of Sam’s fur
>Uselessly doubled over on herself, Jenna is now gasping in the quiet air as she chokes back laughter
>You swallow the knot of shame that’s lodged in your throat
>Keep it together, Anonymous
>Burn that image of her licking herself into your retinas

>Jenna is still laughing as you two slip out the back doors, but once you’re outside in the brisk air, she stops
>She gives you a very inquisitive look, one of her eyebrows raised in confusion
>She inhales deeply through her nose
>”Hold still,” she commands, before-
>What the hell?
>-Putting her nose on your side and sniffing
>You flush red grab her by the ears and pull her away like she was a clingy toddler
“What the hell are you doing?” You demand
>Jenna takes one last whiff before pushing your hands off her sensitive ears
>”You smell like a female in heat.”
>Wat
>”I smelled it last night,” she continues, oblivious to how uncomfortable and confused you are right now.
>Must be instinct
>“But I can’t figure out why… I’m not even close in my cycle, and even if I were, I take estrus blockers.”
“C-Could be anything!” You assure her
>But you’re really only assuring yourself
>You have absolutely 0 idea why you’d smell like a female in heat, but the idea that you reek of something like that frightens you
>Who knows how you’ve smelled this entire time? All throughout high school even?
>Like a sex-drunk bitch, walking down the halls, dragging a trail of pheromones off of you? 
>Christ
“How do you know it’s a… female’s scent?” You say, holding onto a modicum of hope
>Jenna shakes her head
>”Oh, no, I’m sure of it. A female in heat will be pretty noticeable. It smells a little bit like sweat or onions, only more…” she looks to the sky, as if the words were written in the fading darkness “… more sensual, seductive? Like a perfume you really like.”
>Oh
>You can’t say you’ve smelled anything in the church other than the lingering wisps of incense — charred and aromatic, burning your nose, but in a pleasent sort of way 
>”I must just be losing it. After all, I’m fighting vampires and werewolves with you guys, right?” Jenna shrugs her shoulders. “And unless you’re secretly a girl, then I’m just imagining things.”
>You manage to smile a bit
>Who would pretend to be the opposite sex? Like LMAO what would you gain from it?
>Only an awkward weirdo would do that
“I promise you, I’m not a female in heat,” you assure
>the vixen nods
>”Yeah I thought so. Shame though. I think you’d look cute as a girl. Anyway, plans? What are we doing?”
>Ah yes, plans
>You’ve been /so/ good at making and implementing those
>Shit, you were just planning to run to the store really fast and get everyone some breakfast
>And Sam some medicine
>You tell Jenna, who volunteers to stay behind and wake up Alex
>”I just wouldn’t go to The Shop N’ Save down the hill with Mike. I’ll explain later,” Jenna assures you
>Sure, whatever
>You’re long past the point of needing explanations for things
>Though Mike is still asleep in your car
>You wonder if he’d be up for a ride this early?
>Afterall, it’s still dark
>And cold
>And Sam has your jacket still
>You wrap your arms around your shivering body and stride towards your car, your chattering breath disappearing in wisps of steam

>Upon investigation, you don’t find him in your car
>You instead locate him a little bit down the hill, taking a leak on some low scrub brush
>Probably also taking advantage of the fact that nobody /ever/ comes up here
>Except your gang of degenerates
>And the occasional group of punks to get drunk or trip acid
>”Can I get some privacy here?” He asks, speaking to you with his back turned
>He must have heard you coming
“Sure, just a quick question: I’m going to the store. Want anything?”
>His stream halts abruptly with ringing clarity
>I M P R E S S I V E
>”The Shop N’ Save?” He says, stressing the words
>You clear your throat
>It’s kind of awkward having to talk to him while he’s obliterating this bush
>Yet, you soldier on
“Yeah, Jenna told me not to take you down there-”
>He raises his hand as if he were unpausing the conversation and starts peeing again
>”Yeah, she’s got a point. If you’re getting food, bring back some donuts and maybe some Halloween candy. Peanut butter cups’ll do.”
“And what do we say?”
>All he has to do is say please
>You don’t like being ordered around, especially by him
>Instead he says the wrong thing
>”I’ll pay you back. You know Mikey’s good for it,” he says, bending his neck around so you can see his smile
>And the fangs that push between his teeth
>You’re reminded that he still owes you like a whole six pack
“Not what I meant, dude. Try asking again.”
>His smile collapses as he sighs
>You can even see him do a quick eye roll
>”Shit, right. Sorry. PLEASE would you get some donuts and Halloween candy?”
“That’s better.” 
>You wring a smile out of your minor victory
>Shit if he just asks nicely you’ll get all kinds of candy for him

>You grab your keys, plug your phone into your cigarette lighter which hosts a charging plug, and soon you’re off, traveling on barren roads under lightening skies
>Brilliant orange sunlight strokes the clouds, tracing them in flame
>The little shops and the houses lay dormant and dark, save for the occasional parent meandering to their car for their morning commute
>Still plenty of time to get to school after breakfast, and you could use the solitude right now
>You’ve always been introverted, as evidenced by your small squadron of friends and relatively brief social interactions
>Or you’re just a boring, shy, coward
>Nah, you’ve got a lot of positives
>You’re patient
>You flick your turn signal on and coast into the Shop N’ Save’s lot
>You’re brave
>You slide easily into a parking space, given that there’s practically nobody here this early
>And you’ve got this kind of wisdom that only years of introversion and observation can cultivate
>It’s not street smarts, but you do think you’ve got a good head on your shoulders
>You’re gonna make it, brah

>Walking into the Shop N’ Save, you’re assaulted by colors like you owe them money
>Namely orange and black
>There’s plastic pumpkins on a big pile of hay at the front
>Halloween streamers run the length of the candy aisle, which is completely stocked and loaded up with massive packages of chocolates and sweets
>Fake plastic skeletons hang their feet on top of the shelves, and for a fleeting moment you’re reminded of the fact that there is a skelington inside of you right this very moment
>v v v v spooky
>Anyway, the pharmacy is closed, but there’s still plenty of over-the-counter pills to go around
>You can’t help but notice the ‘feminine care’ section is picked clean
>All the scent masks
>All the estrus blockers
>Completely gone
>Well, you didn’t come here for that stuff
>You swipe a bottle of pain pills off a high shelf
>Turning over the bottle, you see that it also advertises itself as a fever reducer
>There, this’ll set Sam straight
>Heh, ‘straight’
>You still never found out if he was gay or not…
>… Or if you are at this point
>Too bad you chickened out
>Not like it matters anymore
>He only makes your heart beat a little faster
>And you only care a lot about him
>Y-You’re just good bros

>With the peanut butter cups, donuts, a gallon of iced coffee, and medicine for Sam, you cruise on back to the church just as the light is beginning to hit the roads
>It drains through the retreating clouds, washing everything in a delicate salmon-pink
>You take your time getting back to the old church, slowing down as you take a short detour through a couple neighborhoods
>The houses are all strung up with cheesy decorations like fake graveyards and glowing plastic jack-o'-lanterns
>To be honest, you fucking love Halloween
>It feels like the border between the living and the dead becomes thinner right around the 31st
>And with all the grass and leaves dying, you can totally see how your ancestors would have thought this was a sacred time where magic abounds
>Unfortunately, given all that’s happened… they weren’t entirely wrong
>But hey, some good has come of this
>Mike is your friend again, maybe more so than ever
>You’re going to save the world
>Alex is still Alex
>Jenna is on your side
>And Sam
>You got to know that little faggot who you used to hate, and you found out he’s a lot braver than you think
>He’s just a good kid in crappy circumstances
>You almost wish he was here next to you, enjoying the scenery
>He probably doesn’t celebrate any holidays because of his shithead father
>Your stomach ties in knots
>His dad is still lurking somewhere
>Hunting you and his son
>Like some kind of primitive animal stalking its prey
>The thought is enough to make you floor it back to the church

>You all sit on the caved in hood of your car, munching down on the sickly sweet donuts, watching your chilled breaths disappear into the lightening sky
>Every bite tastes fills your mouth with pillowy dough and semi-sweet chocolate
>Sam holds his donut in front of his face
>He cautiously sniffs it, his pink nose twitching as he drinks in the rich scent of freshly fried dough and glazed chocolate
>Alex laughs, sending bits of mushy donut onto the pavement
>”Don’t tell me you’ve never eaten a donut before,” he says, taking a large, messy bite out of his own
>Sam looks at Alex, his mouth forming a soft and nervous frown
>Which says everything
>”JHESHUS CHRISHT” Alex says through mouthfuls of donut
>You pat Sam on the head, lightly digging your fingers into his oily fur
“Just try it, dude. I promise you’ll really like it,” you say, ignoring Alex’s obvious wink
>You don’t care
>You’re going to comfort this lil’ bunny while he has his first fucking donut ever
>You almost feel like you should be recording this
>Like a baby’s first steps
>As you lightly scratch at the skin beneath Sam’s fur, his leg starts softly kicking
>Almost like you found some kind of button connected to his stout haunches
>And even though everyone is looking at you, you don’t care
>It’s cute as fuck the way his powerful legs pound into your door

>Sam opens his mouth and extends a rounded edge of the donut past his teeth
>He takes a meager bite
>Almost instantly his eyes shoot open with glee
>Then he takes a huge bite out of his chocolate frosted donut, chewing thoughtfully and savoring the taste
>When he looks up into your eyes, their bright with pure affection and adoration
>As if he was silently singing praise unto you for introducing donuts into his lowly existence
>Y-You too
>You stop scritching his fur and instead draw an anxious hand to the back of your neck
>Those big gooey eyes make you all gooey inside too
>You don’t even want to LOOK at Alex right now
>But you can’t help but look over
>And yeah, his eyebrows are shooting up and down, his face painted with an expression that says ‘You gonna kiss him?’
>But it’s Jenna’s confused glare that catches your attention more
>She’s staring in disbelief right as Sam as he mindlessly hews off hunks of his donut with his quick moving mouth
>Jenna’s nose twitches like mad as she sniffs at the air
>Her head tilts to the side in astonishment
>What is so perplexing about the way Sam smells?
>You can only smell the damp earth and the cold coffee…
>…Which Sam is now taking massive swigs of
>Oh boy caffeinated rabbits
>Jenna shakes her head in disbelief and focuses her attention back on her half-eaten donut
>”Thanks for the food, Anon,” Mike says, leaning back onto the hood with a cup of coffee in hand. “It’s been way too long since I had proper food, you know?”
“Don’t mention it. And hey, if you need blood-”
>”Pass,” he waves a vacant hand at you
>You can’t help but feel slightly offended
>”I’ll be fine for a while longer. Besides, your blood probably tastes terrible.”
>Okay now you’re actually kind of offended
“Implying there’s good tasting blood?”
>Mike just stares off at the empty space
>”I’m sure there is, dude. I’m not really all the way into this yet.”
>He looks pretty zoned out
>Or angry
>But not at you
>Like, his future is basically over
>And he seems to know it
>But a part of him — a part of you — wants to fight for that future
>And you can feel it

>School drags on with all the urgency of a stoned turtle
>You spend most of your time pacing outside of Sam’s classrooms, checking inside every so often to make sure that he’s okay
>Almost always he’s near the back, idly doodling on a loose scrap of paper or staring out a window
>How the hell this kid makes any passing grades is beyond you
>You guess that if you had to put up with the shit that he does back at home, school would be pretty low on your priorities list as well
>You’re just thankful that he doesn’t have any classes with any goths
>And that his dad hasn’t come to school yet
>You feel like a helicopter parent
>You spend the few minutes you have not stalking Sam fraternizing with Jenna, Mike and Alex, who all rode with you to school with you
>And are damn sure leaving with you. No more running away separately
>The plan, you all decide, is to head to your house after school and get some supplies and hang out there versus sleeping in the church
>Your half-baked ‘plan’ seems to be the only thing with some semblance of stability
>Because your fellow students sure as hell aren’t acting like shining beacons of peace, tolerance and stability
>All the fighting and violence you saw yesterday?
>It’s only escalated
>The hallways are no longer fast-moving streams of hormonal bodies, but are giant moving clusters of mammals surrounding fight after fight, fur flying into the air and claws rending into flesh
>When two groups pass each other, it’s liable to end in friction
>Like two gears moving in opposing direction
>You just try and stick to yourself as the hours count by, as teachers rush bruised and bloody students to the nurse’s office, and as the administrative staff grows increasingly worried that they won’t be able to weather this storm

>By the time school ends, you’ve nearly been jumped twice just for being a human
>Or not belonging to any social cliques
>And every time a rival group jumped in to save you — not that they intended to. They just happened to have a bigger problem with the group that was assailing you than you than they had with boring, lonely old Anon
>Primarily, it was jocks who targeted you, looking more and more feral with each passing moment
>The humans were starting to grow facial hair and unsightly body hair, rippling out of their cliche letterman jackets, shearing the red and white fabric
>They’re getting taller and bulkier too, shoulders pulling outwards more with muscles bulging underneath their skin
>And the other mammals? They’re starting to look more wolfish — their ears are coming up in points, their snouts are narrowing into aggressive muzzles
>You observe all of this as you plaster yourself against the wall outside Sam’s classroom
>The bell rolls over and kicks itself as the proverbial floodgates open up
>Students pour out of open doors in great throngs, but all too quickly there’s more skirmishes between the different groups of mammals
>Sam wanders out of class (last, again)
>Your hands shoot out and find his own before he can register what’s happening
>He gives a startled squeak until he realizes it’s your own hands that are pressed into his
“God damn, kid. What took you so long?” You say, tugging him down the hall
>He evens up the pace and falls in line next to you
>”A-A-Are you mad at me?” He says, looking up at you
>You slink past a pair of ugly looking punks by pressing yourself and Sam into the lockers
>The colorful group of mammals — mostly hyenas and weasels — pass by without incident
“No, just… you know that there’s people out there who want to hurt you, right?” You say
>Okay maybe you’re a little upset
>He was taking this whole thing too lightly, you feel
>”S-Sorry,” he says pointing his eyes to the floor
>Sudden pangs of guilt wash over you
“I just want to keep you safe, is all.” 
>You’re filled with determination
>Your march is bold, proud, determined… Your face says “DON’T FUCK WITH ME OR MY BUNNY”
>And nobody does
>Not even when you pass Vanessa
>She just stares after you from behind a black veil, her eyes sunken in from all the eyeliner and sleeplessness
>Swallows of black coffee and cigarettes hold her body aloft 
>She wouldn’t risk an attack in the open, would she?
>Afterall, her two most important targets are right in front of he-
>Ah
>Mike joins you at your side
>That’s why she hasn’t attacked yet
>Mike look especially pissy today, his eyes simmering with the desire to belt someone in the face
>And then Jenna falls in beside him, her head on a cautios swivel
>She steers your walk down an even busier hall that leads out to the parking lot
>Not the direction you’d take, but hey, you’re not going to complain
>It’s fairly roundabout, but anything to keep the bun safe
>Alex casually brings up the rear, his gaunt form looming over the group
>”Same plan?” He says
“Same plan,” you acknowledge, still glaring straight ahead

>When you get outside, you see that the parking lot is absolute chaos
>Cars dart in every direction — almost as if they’re tyring to ram one another
>But you’re not playing this game
>Not even when an SUV nearly clips Mike
>Your short, stocky friend, reaches out his hand…
>…And scrapes into the SUV’s paint, peeling up the metal like he were a human can opener
>Jesus Christ
>That’s some real vampire shit
>Mike only scowls as the driver lays on the horn and stomps on the brakes
>”C’mon kiddies, everyone to Anon’s shit beater,” Mike says, casually strolling towards your car, paying the driver he just clawed no mind
“Well fuck you too, buddy. You can walk,” you say sarcastically
>”Bet I’d still beat you there.”

>You all pile into your car, just like this morning
>The sun was already starting on its way down, shooting godrays across your dashboard
“Anyone need the heat?” You say
>Mike climbs up in the passenger seat
>”Not when I’m here,” he jokes
>hurrrr durrrr
>But he might be right,
>You look behind you, and everyone is crammed so closely together you can’t help but assume that they’re trading body heat
>Alex is sitting in the center
>Jenna and Sam are at his flank, looking incredibly uncomfortable
>Especially Sam, whose pink nose is wrinkling in earnest
>He probably smells something really strong, because his face is once again pulsing with a blush
>Maybe Alex farted…
>No, because Jenna is squinting at Sam, processing something wordlessly
>You just remember you forgot to give Sam his medicine
>Well, when you get to your house, you’ll remember
>Because everything will be as it should be, and you’ll finally get some reprieve

>Everything is not as it should be
>Ohhhh everything is far from that
>Let’s start with your kicked in front door
>It sits in two splinters, loosely suspended on its hinges
>”It could be the wind,” Alex observes quite dumbly
>No, it was not the wind
>It was someone with huge, powerful legs
>Or… something… 
>Moving into the house, there’s more shit that’s fucked up
>First off: everything is in disarray
>Tables and chairs knocked over
>Couches on their sides
>Jesus Christ someone had to be really strong
>Or really mad
>To do this
>The TV sports a massive hole in it that’ll cost you your non-existent college fund
>The fridge is open and food is everywhere
>And
>You sprint to your room
>It’s completely destroyed
>Everything is upside down, smashed, or seemingly tossed against the wall
>That includes your PC
“Muh rig,” you whisper, staring down at the shattered and snapped silicone pieces
>”I’m just going to assume you don’t normally live like this,” Jenna observes with suspicion, speaking low. “So it looks like someone knows where you live.”
“Right,” you say, bending over a torn sleeping bag from the night that Alex and Sam slept in your house. “So, we’re sure as hell not staying here for until Friday. Take what we need — extra clothes, money, beer…” your eyes quickly sweep over Sam, who is sniffing at the air. “Soap…”
>”Speaking of soap,” Jenna cuts in. “I want to shower.”
>”Same,” Mike agrees
>You’re dumbstruck
“My house just got broken into and trashed and you want to shower… here… now?”
>”It’s not like they’ll come back. They already broke in and didn’t find what they were looking for,” Jenna says, kicking at your tossed up bedsheets. “Besides, I have something I want to test.”
“What did you want to test, if humans bathe with their tongues?” You fold your arms across your chest
>Jenna blushes
>”Oh fuck off… I just want to test something with Sam. You go get him to shower.”
“Is this really urgent? Like, do we need to do this now?” You hiss
>Mike is already stripping off his clothes
>”You two have five seconds to get out of here before I’m naked
>Jenna’s neck turns on a dime
>Her blush only strengthens when she sees Mike’s half-naked body struggling to get out of a pair of jeans
>Sam comes rolling in to the room with a Dr. Bepper in hand
>”W-What’s going on in he-”
>You shield his delicate little eyes from the sight of Mike’s stocky, shirtless body
>Nobody deserves to see that
>Jenna squeals and slaps Mike on the back
>”God damnit, put your clothes back on until you get to the bathroom!” She cries
>Mike lurches forward from the blow
>”Jesus! Claws!” He wheezes. “Fucking snapjaw!”
>You gasp
>Sam gasps
>Jenna snarls
>”What did you just say?”
>”I-” Mike struggles his shirt back on his head. “It just kind of slipped ou-”
>Jenna growls deep in her chest and bares her fangs
>”Go shower, Sapone, or I’m going to bite your dick off.”
>”I’m going, Christ. Watch the claws next time!” He hobbles through the doorway, past Sam, his pants still barely on

>You lead Sam up to your shower, grabbing a towel from your room
>He’s still slurping on his Dr. Bepper
>”W-Where are we going?” He asks as you flick on hallway lights
“Jenna thinks it’s best if everyone gets a shower in,” you grumble, clearly unhappy with the decision
“It doesn’t look like whoever fucked up your house did anything to the bathrooms, strangely enough
>Sam pales
>”S-Shower?! I-I-I don’t need to s-shower or b-bathe with yo-”
>Wew lad
“Slow down there buddy, you and I aren’t showering together. You’re showering by yourself. And yes, you do need a fucking shower.”
>Man, you’re awfully pissy
>You run the water in your bathroom
“There’s shampoo, conditioner, and a bar of soap,” you say, pointing to all the dark blue bottles lining the shower floor
“Oh, and this is for you. You’ve been burning hot since this morning,” you practically throw the little pill at him
>”W-What is this?” He squeaks
“Just take it,” you sigh. “I’m going to go keep watch. You know how to use a shower, right?”
>Damn
>You’re REALLY pissy
>The bunny nods, clearly hurt,
>His greasy bangs fall across his eyes
>You shut the door on him as the hiss of the shower starts up
>You slide backwards with a tremendous sigh. “Fucccck,” you mutter as you lean into the door
>You were hoping to be able to spend the rest of the week here, where there’s beds and bathrooms and showers
>But now either Sam’s dad or the goths know where you live
>They could have easily got your information from the school
>Or followed you one day
>Or
>Bleh
>It doesn’t matter
>If your information is compromised, then so is everyone elses’
>There’ll be no holing up at Jenna’s, Mike’s, or Alexi’s
>Nope, just more nights at the fucking church
>Jehsush Chroist

>You are Sam
>Oh shit oh fuck oh fuck
>It smells like Anonymous in here
>Every breath you take coats your lungs in his scent
>Your insides are starting to feel hot and confused, like balloons knotted together
>The illustrious human musk — kind of sour, masculine, spicy, is your drug
>You’ve been addicted to it ever since you met Anon
>Or maybe it’s just him?
>You run your hands through your long-ish hair
>You are really, really greasy, and you do need a shower
>But the whole room is spinning something awful
>You quickly down the pill Anon gave you
>Maybe you are getting sick?
>Or…
>Worse… You’re in your cycle
>You gasp, but that only serves to put more of Anon in your lungs
>Being in heat right now is absolutely not what you or anyone else needs
>Christ, why are you such a burden to everyone?
>Even Anon seemed pissed off at you
>You jump 10 feet into the air when you hear a light rapping on the door
>”Yo, dude, are you going to shower? Because I have to go after you,” Anon says, his voice tired and uninterested
“Y-Yes!” You stammer, shucking your ratty hoodie and whipping it onto the sink
>“Good,” Anon says with a flatness to his tone. “Just don’t clog the drain with fur.”
>”R-Right!”
>You tug on the waistband of your pants with hesitation
>Your eyes flick over to the door
>As quiet as a mouse (though they’re not that quiet, in actuality. One of your neighbors was a mouse and she was up all night ‘squeaking’ most night) you jiggle the knob and find that the lock holds
>Unlike back home
>But you’re not thinking of /that/ home. You don’t live there anymore.
>You finally lose the pants
>And there you stand, in the mirror, wearing a stained white undershirt and a pair of old boxers
>Your meager breasts stand like little bumps against the thin white fabric of the sahirt
>You delicately palm them and wonder why you even have them?
>You’re still a woman, you know that much is true
>You’re just not a good woman
>You could never make Anon- Y-You mean, any man, happy
>So why do you care so much?
>The most feminine feature you posses, you think, is your hips and thighs
>Because of your slender, delicate frame, your prominent haunches look simply ridiculous
>Even as emaciated as you are, your thighs are rounded and powerful, nature-built for sprinting and kicking
>Put all of this in one body and you’re like a badly cobbled together art project
>Your proportions are all wrong
>You lift your shirt just a little bit, blushing all the while
>Here goes nothing
>One a quick motion you jerk your shirt off, tugging it over your long ears
>And there you stand, again
>A brown Mini-Rex rabbit, wearing nothing but her boxers, blushing furiously
>It must be the scent of Anonymous in here that’s throwing you off
>You shake your head again to try and loosen your… urges…
>But it’s no use
>Maybe a shower will help?

>Building a curtain of steam, you take probably longer than you should under the rinse
>But…
>… You actually got to shower for the first time in a /long/ time, and that feels like heaven
>You look into the fogged mirror, wiping aside a layer of mist with your paws
>With your fur freshly scrubbed, hair shampooed and conditioned and laying in thick, wet stracnds across your face, you feel…
>…Cute? 
>Pretty?
>Oh god
>Are you pretty?
>No
>This is just the heat talking
>You’ve n-never been pretty
>You’re just a dumb useless rabbit
>Still
>When you lean in closer, you can’t help but feel a gentle tinge of heat come into your cheeks
>You drop your slender, rounded shoulders and summon a deep, misty breath
>With unsure eyes, you scan over your body, lightly twisting your long, floppy ears that hang down like two useless snakes growing from your scalp
>You let a wandering finger trace their pink insides before smoothing the fur out across your face
>Your nose and whiskers wrinkle at your own gentle touch
>You run your hand through your hair and push it back
>It’ll dry soon
>Now, it’s time for the real moment of truth
>You close your eyes and slowly exhale a knot of nervous air
>The towel drops in a damp pile around your feet

>You’ve done it
>You’re totally naked
>You haven’t been totally naked in…
>… Well it’s been a long time
>With appraising eyes and wandering fingers you scan over your still sodden body, its fur matted down with warmth
>You have a thin, almost emaciated midsection that draws down from your upper torso
>Dotting your chest are two pink nipples, suspended on your two palmable breasts, hanging softly above your quite visible ribcage
>Your bones are delicate and fragile, almost hollow
>Like a bird’s
>You travel down further to where your waist pinches in
>And then bows out again gently with noticeable exaggeration
>Set back powerfully are your haunches, which meld into your rather apparent thighs
>And between them…
>You shiver as you brush a finger over your sensitive clit
>… Is the pink slit of your sex
>You’ve never known how to feel about this, since girls aren’t tough, and vaginas aren’t either…
>… Is what you tell yourself
>Jacob wanted you to be tough
>Dad wanted you to be his son
>But you couldn’t be either of those things
>You don’t feel like a boy — you know you’re not
>No matter how hard you try, you can’t make it happen
>You can only pretend for Jacob’s memory and Dad’s approval
>You’ve done it for so long that you hardly know your feminine side. But it’s there, lurking beneath your sensitive skin
>And you don’t feel brave
>You just feel like a weakling
>So you pretend to be someone you’re not, so you can be strong
>Just like Jacob would have wanted

>Still…
>You give a quick spin
>Your poofy tail flairs out, and you catch a quick glimpse of your naturally padded buttocks
>Glutes from all the running and from what nature gave you
>And that’s just how rabbits are built, you guess
>Oh god
>Your face flushes as you think back to the cheerleader who absolutely M O G G E D you in the hallways yesterday
>D-Do you honestly compete with her?
>Better question: do you think you do?
>God, deep in your tiny, fluttery little heart, you hope so
>But you’d never admit that
>Nobody finds you attractive
>Anon is just so nice to you since you’re his friend
>Yeah
>You’re friends
>You don’t have feelings for him!
>Even though being near him makes your heart start to race
>And when you’re with him all the noise in your head just goes quiet
>It’s like nothing else matters
>He’s handsome, and kind, and brave, and you’re so glad he’s your…
>… friend
>Oh who the hell are you kidding
>He’s you knight in shining armor, Jesus fucking Christ

>Your knight in shining armor bangs loudly on the door, sending you 10 feet into the air
>”Yo Samuel. Sammy. Sammethy. You done in there?”
“J-Just a minute!” You scramble to throw on your clothes
>And you check one last time for hair in the drain
>Thankfully, you managed to scoop all your loose trimmings into the trashcan
>You don’t want to offend Anon
>After all, he’s probably not used to having anthros in his house
>You and Jenna need to set positive examples
>You open the door and slip on out, fully clothed, but still damp
>A trail of steam follows you
>Anon looks up at you, his trailing his eyes from the red book suspended in his palms over to you
>You nervously brush your hair out of your eyes
“I-I’m done,” you say
>For whatever reason you feel extra self-conscious, just standing there in the hallway, still wet, wearing some crusty old clothes
>Anon studies you with interest before slapping the red book shut and loosening his tie
>”Lookin’ sharp, kid. My turn.” Anon slides past you, and you just stand there like some kind of gawking idiot 
>“I promise I’ll be quick,” he says
>The door slams with a *WHOMF* and the hiss of the shower can be heard not long after
>You… You don’t know what to do now
>You’ve always waited for someone to tell you what to do and where to go
>Your eyes scan the hallways, lined with shattered family portraits
>You bounce a little on your heels
>What now?
>Ah
>Wait
>Doesn’t Anonymous have a comic book collection?
>Oh my fuck he does
>You bound off down the hallway, using your nose to sniff out Anon’s room
>Finding his is easy: It’s the one that smells the most like a mix of sweat, cologne and human musk
>The smell hits you like a massive wave, and in an instant, you’re dizzy
>You steady yourself on the doorframe
>Your head swims through the musk, drawing your legs into a mechanical trot through the doors
>Unwashed clothes are strewn about the floor like land mines of pheromones
>Wew
>You can hardly think straight
>And it’s by sheer luck that you manage to wander over to Anon’s book shelves
>You find the comics, but you’re barely reading
>Mostly just sitting there with an open copy of Superman, rubbing your thighs together absentmindedly
>It might be time to admit your heat is getting to you
>…
>Nah, you’ll be okay. You can control this
>Anon casually strolls into the room wearing nothing but a towel
>[Thigh rubbing intensifies]
>You squeak loudly and shield your eyes with a copy of The Man of Steel
>Anon jumps back
>”Oh FUCK, dude!” His hands fly to his waist
>He tightens the towel around his midsection
>But your eyes still creep over the top of your hastily constructed visual barrier to catch a glimpse of his bare, hairless chest
>”What are you doing in here?” He asks breathlessly
>You can’t tell for sure, but is his face going scarlet?
>You forget to answer
>You’re just…
>Staring
>Possibly drooling
>Anon snaps his fingers
>”Yo, dude. I need to change. So just like… turn around or something.”
“W-WHAT!?” You practically shriek
>Anon looks at you with an expression of confusion
>”I’m going to change. In my own room. Is that not okay with you?”
“Y-You mean like you-your’re g-going to b-b-b-be naked?”
>A moment of silence passes
>Anon blinks a few times and droops his shoulders
>”I mean… yes. I planned on it. I’m not wearing anything except this towel right now.” He pats his hip
>You can’t help but watch the whole thing, eyes wide
>come to think of it, you don’t think you’ve ever seen a naked human before
>Sure you’ve seen shirtless humans (briefly), but never…
>Oh god
>Your heat is so fucking bad
>This is bad
>Anon, oblivious as fucking usual, turns around and starts grabbing underwear, socks and a pair of jeans from his drawers
>”I-” you stand up, still shielding your eyes with a copy of superman
>Just put down the comic
>C’mon
>His back muscles are probably so hot
>Maybe the towel will slip off
>And maybe he’ll turn around
>And maybe he’ll say to you:
>’Sam, I want to make sweet, gentle love to you.’
>OH GOD WHAT IF HE DOES GET NAKED WITH YOU IN THE ROOM
>HE STILL THINKS YOU'RE A BOY
>You open your mouth to stammer out an apology, but the sound of heavy, damp fabric hitting the carpet makes your heart stop
>He did it
>He’s naked
>”Turn around a sec,” Anon says quite casually
>You oblige, absolutely GLOWING RED in the face
>Quickly you drop the comic and start tugging painfully at your ears
>Stupid
>Stupid
>Why did you think you could just WALTZ right into Anon’s musky room and start going through his shit?
>Stupid
>Well, he doesn’t seem to care too much, so maybe this isn’t entirely a fuck up on your behalf
>Maybe he’s just really mad at you and he isn’t showing it
>Oh god, he’s probably so mad
>Well good going fucktard, you fucked up something else
>Dad was right
>Still clenching your ears, you (very stupidly and impulsively) turn around and begin to apologize profusely
>…Which was the wrong move
>Anonymous, bare-chested and in a pair of boxers, stands in front of you, one leg shoved down the length of his pants
>Your eyes meet
>And for a brief second, nobody moves
>You’re pretty sure your heart stopped beating
>Anon is glowing red, his mouth working like he’s trying to say something
>You slut
>”Sam?” 
“Y-Yes…?”
>”Are you gay?”
“…I g-guess not.”
>Anon slips his other leg into his pants and hikes them up to his waist
>He studies you
>”…Because if you are, I won’t judge you.”
>You don’t realize you’re breathing hot, sultry breaths
>Or that you haven’t taken your eyes off of him 
>Or that you’re gently rubbing your thighs together
“I…” you start to answer, but Anon interjects impatiently
>”Would you… just… turn around, or something?”
>…
>Ah, right
>You blink yourself back to reality
>You turn to face Anon’s bookshelf in shame while Anonymous throws on the rest of his clothes 
>”Do you feel better?” He asks in a concerned tone
>What?
>NO! There’s a fire in your heart!
>…A-And between your legs
“Wh-What do you m-mean?” You ask, because you’re curious
>”From the fever. You were burning up this morning. Thought I was going to have to pretend to be your dad and get you out of school or something.”
“O-Oh.” You nervously dig your feet into the carpet
>He thinks you have a fever
>Can you imagine if he really knew the truth?
>You clutch your ears tightly
>He can never know 
>Nobody can ever know what a weak bitch you really are
“Y-Yeah, I f-f-feel a lot b-bett-tter. T-Thanks for the m-medicine. B-Besides I-I don’t think I-I have an-any more s-s-sick days left.”
>”Christ,” Anonymous says. “Did your dad keep you home a few days?”
>You struggle to keep your eyes forward
>All you want to do is turn around and drink in Anon’s unremarkable body
>Sure, he’s not ripped
>He’s just… average build, slightly tall
>But to you, he’s your superhero
>He’s your Man of Steel
>Geeze, humans must take awhile to get dressed
>”Sam?” Anon asks again
“S-Sorry. I w-was t-thinking. Yeah I-I got sick f-for a week an-and some d-d-days I just ca-can’t go to sc-school. T-T-T-Too much g-going on a-a-at home.”
>”With you and your dad? Where’s your mom in all of this? And your brother? You mentioned you had a brother, I think.”
”Mom is…” your eyes fall to the copy of Superman at your feet
>Your courage seems to drain out through your toes
>No
>You’re brave, damnit
>You promised Jacob you’d be brave and strong
“…Gone. I d-don’t kn-know where s-she w-went. Dad said s-she ra-ran away because of me and Jake.”
>Anon hums In thought
>There’s a quick hiss as he applies a shot of cologne to his chest
>The sweet, slightly bitter scent hits your nostrils instantly
>It’s pleasant and sharp, and your nose seems addictied to it
>”Jake… is that your brother?”
”Uh-huh.”
>”Were you two tight?”
“W-What?”
>”Sorry. Were you two close?”
>Your heart catches in your chest
>Yes, you were close
>But at times, you were distant
>Jacob was your protector, your guardian angel
>He tried to teach you how to be strong
>How to defend yourself
>Stand up for yourself and others
>But he had too much of dad in him
>Too much bitterness swallowed down like each hard pull on Dad’s bottles
>Too much vitrol, spite, choking on it at times
>He’d turn against you sometimes
>Other times he was downright psychotic
>But you knew it was always done out of a desire to make you tougher
>Like an Indian Summer, he wouldn’t be around forever
>And he must have known it, somewhere deep inside of him, where the whiskey rotted his guts
>You only helped accelerate that
>When you…
>You know…
>On the tracks-
>”Dude!”
>Anon drags your hands away from your ears, his heavy fingers ringing around your slender wrists
>”You’re going to hurt yourself!”
>Your eyes crack open
>Anon has your hands forced against your sides before you even realize what you’re doing
>For the first time in years, pain rings dully in your ears, like a pulsing heartbeat
>”Christ almighty, kid. You scared me.”
“S-Sorry,” you squeak helplessly. “I-I didn’t m-mean t-to do it. I j-just th-thought of my-”
>”Brother?”
>You nod
>”You don’t have to talk about him if you don’t want to. I’m sorry, I didn’t know this was so hard for you.”
>You squeeze your eyes shut again, and all you see is Jacob’s worn face, eyes sunken in and smoldering with anger, like Dad’s
>He haunts the pinks of your eyes and the space behind your skull
>The image of that day on the tracks comes rushing back to you, and your legs start to tremble
>God DAMNIT! Jacob didn’t die so you could continue to be a coward!
>You aren’t alone anymore! You have people that care about you
>People that love you
>The fact that you’re even in a friend’s house right now is proof of that
>Your trembling subsides into little tremors that you press into the carpet
>You suck in some of the cologne-y diffused air
>Here goes nothing
>Time to play all of your cards (except, obviously, your most important one)
“M-My brother is d-d-d-d-dead,” you say, exhaling the tightness of your chest on the last syllables
>Anon tightens his grip, as if anticipating another anxiety attack
>You slacken the muscles in your shoulders and arms
>Like some kind of scared animal injected with morphine, your tension stymies
>”I had no idea. I’m sorry,” he says, after a silence that drags on for far too long
>His grip comes loose as he feels you go soft
>You inspect the scarlet rings pressed into your skin encircling your wrists
>Nothing you can’t handle
>Strange, this time it was done out of concern, and not out of rage
“I-It’s okay. W-We were cl-close, b-but i-it was f-four years a-ago,” you breathe out, still not able to turn around and face Anonymous. “I-I need to g-g-get over i-it already.”
>”Shit, right before you started high school?”
“Y-Yeah. T-The summer before…”
>You wait for another question, but only feel Anon shifting behind you
>You feel two pairs of gentle, stiff arms slip around your scrawny midsection
>Anon pulls you against him, into a hug
>You can feel the rigidity of his whole body against yours
>The sharp angles of a boy, the arc of his body bent over yours
>The gentle fabric of his shirt
>The coarseness of his jeans digging into your back
>You take in a whiff of his cologne, his clean-smelling deodorant, his freshly scrubbed hair and skin
>Your legs go weak, and you dissolve backwards into your friend
>That’s right
>You’re safe
>He’s your friend
>”You know?” Anon’s voice is deep and scratchy so close to your ears
>You like the way it sends shivers up and down your body 
>Like little veins of electricity
>You even like the feel of his chin digging into your shoulder flesh
>You just like… him
>”For all the shit you’ve gone through, you’re really strong.”
>Your heart sinks in your chest
”I-I-I d-don’t th-”
>”It’s true,” he says in a low, gentle voice, sending more electricity coursing through your nerves. “You’re one of the strongest people I know.”
>How can he say that, after what your cowardice did — what it continues to do to people?
>But you thank him meekly anyway, hoping he never lets go

>You are Anonymous
>And there’s a trillion things you pretend not to notice, as you buckle your seatbelt
>You pretend not to notice how wet from the shower everyone still is as they pile into your car
>You pretend not to notice all the doe-eyes Sam is making at you as he buckles into the passenger seat
>…Though you secretly like it
>You pretended not to notice (or care) when Mike and Alex come out of your house with armload of beer and Dr. Beppers
>You just want to go 
>Because you’re pretending not to notice the rusted sedan down the block
>The one that’s been idling there for some time
>”Everyone done pillaging my house?” You ask, sounding annoyed and slightly nervous. “Because I’d like to get a move on before Dracula over there bites my dick off.”
>”C’mon baby, you know I’m good for it.” Mike massages the shoulders of your seat. “Besides, you know Comrade Alexi will give us a proletariat’s discount to get more.”
>”I think I’m fired,” Alex says, quite unconcerned
“Was it me?” You ask
>Alex shrugs. “Nahhhhh I haven’t showed up in a couple of days.”
>Mike’s smile is brighter than Jenna’s chance at making Valedictorian
>”Awwww hell yeah man, I didn’t know you were on the schedule. Nice going.”
>”Also when we rescued you, I may have attacked my boss.”
>”Alex, I’d kiss you right now if it wouldn’t make Anon jealous,” Mike says
>You sigh and pretend not to notice Mike’s bullshit as you put the car into gear
>You do NOT have time for this 
>Nor the fortitude either
>As you slip out of the neighborhood, that rusted sedan follows, but turns left when you go right
>Must have just been someone lost

>Still…
>As you drive you can’t help but see that rusted sedan everywhere as you sail down the main road and up the hill
>It’s just never right behind you, at least for long
>Always turning out of shopping centers and then breaking a hard right down unassuming neighborhoods, and then popping up again somehow
>You roll into the church’s cracked lot, the sedan an even distance behind you
>Everyone, carelessly, piles out of the car
>The sedan pauses on the road running past the church
>Alright something is going on
>Something you really don’t like
>Sam is fast asleep next to you as everyone else piles out
>You nudge him with your elbow
>His eyes delicately flutter open
“Hey.” You lean over and whisper in his ear. “Stay down, okay? Don’t sit up. Not for any reason.”
>He looks around impulsively, and then, meeting your eyes, nods
>You lean back in your seat as well, keeping an eye on the crossroads that lead into the church
>The rusted sedan rolls on by without interest
>You try to make out who might driving, but the windows are so dark that it only just reflects back your shitheap vehicle like a fun house mirror
>It only serves to make your car even more awful looking
>Apparently uninterested, the rusted vehicle continues on down the road, and then down the hill, until it disappears and melds into the rest of traffic
>At last, the car disappears in a cloud of dust down at the end of the road, tanking down the hill
>You lean up fully and stretch your arms
>Sam follows your lead
>You swear you’ve seen that car once before, but you can’t place where
>…
>It’s not unlikely it was just trying to get to the opposite end of town while avoiding traffic
>That’s what most of the cars who pass by the church are doing anyway
>”W-What was that?” Sam asks
>His seatbelt comes undone with a janky *click*
>The belts are old and probably do more harm that good at this point
“Probably nothing,” you admit. “I’m just being paranoid.”
>And maybe you were
>”O-Oh.” Sam looks around
>His hair is feathery and soft looking when its washed
>It falls across his face like a wispy spools of brown thread
>If he didn’t look feminine before… BOI, now he does
>He looks like he’s got something he wants to say as his mouth does that thing where it half-opens and half-closes, accented by little murmurs
>”Th-Thanks for letting m-me s-s-s-shower and fo-for listening to m-me back there,” he says in his strongest voice.
>Ah, straight to the point
>He’s getting bolder
>You like this new Sam
>And liking him makes you smile
“Don’t mention it,” you say as you undo your own seatbelt
>It’s already starting to get cold in the car as the sun slopes downward in the western sky
“C’mon, let’s get inside,” you say, popping open your door

>Mike is waiting patiently on concrete steps to the church
“You gonna crash in my car again?” You ask, fully ready to launch the keys at him
>He nurses a beer
>One of your dad’s beers, you might add
>Ah well, everything is fucked anyway. Dad’ll understand.
>”Sam?” Mike jerks his chin up at the rabbit. “Can you go wait inside with Jenna and Alex? There’s something I want to talk to Anon about.”
>Sam looks up at you, as if seeking approval
>You nod and flash a quick smile
“They don’t bite,” you assure him. This seems to do the trick, as the rabbit hesitantly leaves your side and makes for the back of the church
>You and Mike watch him disappear into the dark
>”He’s got it bad for you, dude.”
>You sigh deeply
“That’s what everyone keeps saying, but Sam tells me he’s not gay. I don’t know what to make of it.”
>There’s a long pause
>And then the sound of a train rolling by down the steep hill punctures the night and presses little earthquakes into the dirt
>”Well, look. We’re not here to discuss Sam’s sexuality — or yours either.”
>You flip him off, but his reaction is steady and cold, never taking his eyes off you
>”I’m just wondering if I need to stay at home. Sit this out.”
“What? Mike Sapone does not sit things out. Whatever happened to breaking every finger on th-”
>”Do you think we’re safe here?” He interjects “And I mean, do you think that whoever or whatever fucked your house up… knows where the rest of us live?”
>You shrug
“I suppose it’s possible, if they found my house. That information is at the school anyway.”
>Mike sucks on his beer. The top of the bottle comes loose from his lips with a hollow *piff*
>”Do you see what I’m getting at now? Shit… If they hurt my bitch of a sister, I…”
>He squeezes the bottle
>It explodes in a shower of amber glass as it pops like a cheap balloon in his vampiric grasp
>”Shit,” he says without urgency, watching shards fall from his loose grip
“Happen a lot?”
>”More than you’d think. I’ll get another one later.”
>He sighs and levels his gaze out at the car and at the crossroads
>C’mon Anonymous. Say something…
>…Helpful
“I wouldn’t worry about it. If they’re not attacking us in the hallways — or if Sam’s dad isn’t seen running around the school — then it’s safe to say they won’t go after us so boldly. My house was ideal because nobody was there.”
>Mike leans back on his palms
>”You think they were looking for something?”
“…Or someone…” you add, and you know Mike knows who you’re talking about
>Sam’s insane father
>Don’t want to rule out any possibilities
>”Fucking hell,” Mike runs a hand through his freshly scrubbed hair. “You know Thumper is a liability to us now, right?”
>Liability
>The word makes him seem like he’s a burden to you and the entire group
>But he’s not
>Sam is more than just dead weight to you
>You wince at the utterance of the word, but keep your composure
“It really doesn’t matter whether or not someone is looking for him. In fact, this is the best case scenario,” you reason. “If he wasn’t here, he’d be with his shit head father, or captured by Vanessa and her merry gang of retards.”
>Mike snorts with laughter
>”God, they are fucking cringe, aren’t they? Like, it’s 2019 — who the fuck is still a goth?”
“Talking a lot of shit for someone who is literally a vampire,” you shrug
>”Ah, right.” Mike examines his pale flesh
>In the dusk you can better appreciate the way his eyes shimmer with a predatory glow
>”I think I’m getting hungry,” he says at last
>You take a cautious step backwards
>”Relax, fagtron. I’m not going to attack you. But I do need to figure this out.”
>Still, he might… eventually
“What if we got some good, bloody beef or something? There’s a butcher at the Shop N’ Save.”
>Mike deflates at the mention of the store
>”Can’t really go back there. I think it might be a little unsafe for me.”
>Christ
>Where can you go?
“Well, what if I went? Not tonight, but maybe tomorrow or Friday?” How long do you think you can hold out for?”
>”Long enough,” Mike stands up, his shoes scraping against the concrete
>He stretches out wide
>”I’m not helpless. If I need to, I’ll make a ‘shopping trip’ down to the town.”
“If you could avoid spawning new vampires, that’d be awesome,” you say, folding your arms across your chest
>”Fine, fine. But let’s speed this along. You know Mikey ain’t patient. Now…” he holds his open palm out and clears his throat. “If I could PLEASE have your keys, that’d be great. Guess I’m spending another night here.”
>You fish your keys from your pocket and drop them in his waiting hands
>”Thanks man. Beats sleeping in the gutter.”
“No less than you deserve,” you add with a half-chuckle
>He shoots you some dismissive finger guns and starts walking over to your car
“Hey, wait. One more thing,” you call to him
>Mike doesn’t bother turning around to address you
>”Want a goodnight kiss?”
“You’re… you’re with us, right? Like until the end?”
>This time he does turn around
>He looks at you, a fire glowing behind his eyes
>”Until the very end, fagtron. They took my future from me. The least I can do is make them pay for it.”
>You stand frozen on the steps as Mike stares daggers at you — but you know it’s not meant for you
>He turns back around
>”Goodnight.”

>Inside the church Alex and Jenna are asleep on the floor instead of on the rickety pews
>Sam is curled up in a tight little bun-ball on the carpet
>Aside from Alex snoring, the church is dead silent
>Sam looks so peaceful the way his nose wrinkles and his chest delicately rises and falls as he obeys the gravity of sleep
>You can’t fight back a weak smile
>It’s good to see him at peace, see his face without tension or worry
>A train snores by in the night
>It’s so close that you can feel it rumbling underneath the floors
>You can imagine the holy water basin at the front entrance of the church is trembling
>Sam’s face tenses up and lines appear in his forehead
>His legs start kicking softly — almost as if he were twitching, or running from something
>You lay down next to him to try and get him to stop…
>…You tell yourself
>His body tenses up in his light doze
>As gingerly as you can, you pull him close to you and feel him tremble against your chest
>You feel helpless, just watching him have an anxiety attack in his sleep
>God, it’s no fucking wonder he’s so anxious
>His dad is insane
>He lives in squalor
>His brother is dead
>His mom is gone
>He’s never had any friends
>Until he met you
>You’re sorry for how you treated him up until now
>He didn’t deserve it
>Your eyes feel heavy as buckets of water
>Even though the carpet is uncomfortable, just holding Sam like this and feeling him safe is a greater comfort than any bed
>And the train rolls on in the night

>”Unwanted.”
>The words fall from your father’s lips like they were 20 tons apiece
>His face is stern and hard; carved out of granite and limestone, weathered by whiskey
>”And that’s all she’ll ever be. A burden. Hold her arm out,” he commands
>Jacob is still
>You tremble all over, fear tracing cold fingers up and down your spine
>Tears swell up in your eyes, but you can’t look away from Dad’s hard stare
>Be strong
>Be brave
>Your brother puts his hand on your shoulder while Dad sucks on his cigarette
>Smoke tendrils — midnight black — wisp up into a cloudless sky and evaporate into the sunlight
>”No,” Jacob says, his voice clipping hard in his throat
>He’s nervous, standing besides the car, parked at the rail yard
>”You don’t need to hurt us. We learned our lesson already,” Jacob says
>You look up into your brother’s bruised face
>His jaw is set hard and stern — just like Dad’s
>His eyes burn with heat and anger
>And despite the fear and trembling in his words, he’s still Jacob
>He’s still his father’s son
>”What’s the matter with you?” Dad rises to his full height, standing at eye-level with Jacob. His ears stick straight up like pillars. “You were always a good boy, not like this runt here.” He motions to you with a half-assed shrug of his shoulders. "First I catch you two with my gun…” he lifts his greasy work shirt up a little to reveal the pistol tucked in his waistband “…and then I catch you two trying to run away?” 
>Dad jerks his chin to a pile of old clothes, two backpacks, and a gleaming aluminum baseball bat sitting besides his rusted sedan
>”You got something to prove?” He asks giving Jacob a hard look
>Your brother doesn’t answer
>Dad scowls harder, his lower lip trembling as rage boils and churns in his guts
>”You think you’re some kind of man?” He asks again
>Your mind is cast back to the last time — in the kitchen — when Jacob said he ‘was a man’
>The blow your father dealt him still makes your heart skip
>After silence, Dad bends down to your pathetic height, curving his knarled spine
>You’re just 14, Jacob 20, and even for a girl, you’re small, thin and delicate
>You’re trying to be strong, but you can’t help the tears
>Dad’s expression is cold
>His dead eyes look directly through you
>”Roll up your sleeves. Hold out your arm.”
>Jacob grips your shoulder tight
>You know what’s coming next
>Dad holds the cigarette lighter from his car up to you so you can see
>Its coils glow angry and red with trapped heat
>”Dad,” Jacob starts, looking down at you. “Don’t. She didn’t do anything wrong. I was the one who came up with the idea to run away. I made her do it. If you have to punish anyone…” 
>Jacob’s courage falters as he looks down at the hot lighter, still bright orange
>”Punish me. Not her,” he says with a hard swallow
>Dad squats down and roughly grabs your thin arm with a fierce scowl, still chewing on the end of his ciggarette
>He rakes back your sleeve, exposing your thin, brown fur
>”Don’t worry,” he says. “You’ll get yours. You two wanna act so brave? Thinkin’ you two can just run off?”
>You’re shaking something awful
>Jacob’s hands dig into your flesh
>You try to focus on his presence and not your dad ringing his heavy hand around your delicate wrist
>”All you’ll ever be is a burden,” Dad says to you
>”Be strong,” Jacob says in a whisper
>Your eyes slam shut
>You jerk your head to the side and grit your teeth
>Dad slams the lighter onto your arm, just below your shoulder
>The pain hits you like a fucking train, searing into your fur and then your tender flesh
>You can hardly hold back a scream
>Your heavy feet stamp into the dirt as dad lazily twists the lighter against your fur
>The scent of gravel
>Of dust
>Cigarette smoke
>Of burning fur
>You suck these in deeply and let them pollute your young lungs
>You want the cancer
>Anything to produce an absence in you
>Void the soul
>Cash the check
>How do you disappear completely?
>What would Samurai Outlaw do right now?
>Dad’s grip on you tightens and an anguished scream rakes itself out of your chest
>Samurai Outlaw would fight back
>Your brother’s baseball bat
>You could make a break for it
>You could… stand up for yourself
>For Jacob
>Move it
>Move your FUCKING FEET
>Fuck
>Your arm is starting to feel numb as the pain resides
>Dad releases his vice grip on you 
>When your eyes unglue, you hesitantly look down at your arm
>There’s a ring of singed fur where the lighter was pressed against your tender flesh
>Beneath that your pale skin is bright red and oozing blood and pus
>It looks boiled over and ugly
>You try delicately touching it, but draw your hand away when even the slightest probing sends shockwaves of agony through your body
>”Your turn,” Dad says between his smoke
>He grabs Jacob’s arm and shoves his sleeve upwards
>”We’re not done — not yet.”
>A train whistle sounds over head

>You stand on railroad ties, facing the tunnel as if it were the barrel of a loaded gun
>”When I was your age, my father used to take me out to the tracks and make me dodge trains until I could barely move.” Your Dad takes a long swig out of his bottle
>Jacob stand off to the side, watching you with nervous eyes
>”And I know you two been out here. I know all kinds of shit you two been up to. Jacob been bringin’ you out here so he can jump ties, just like his old man. But not like you.”
>He spits into the dirt and mashes it with his heels
>”You ain’t blood.”
>You stare straight ahead as a train whistle shrieks in the tunnel
>An advancing light begins to burn in the fathoms of darkness
>The sun on your fur glazes you in a nervous sweat
“I-I’m sorry!” You cry
>You’re a coward
>The worst kind
>Without your brother you’re not even a coward
>You’re nothing
>A train horn drowns out your pleading
>Dad can only laugh in sharp fits
>”Everyone’s always sorry but nobody wants to own up to it.” He takes another heavy pull on the bottle. “Now, I want a good clean dodge. No bullshit. No jumping too soon. You may be a bitch but I ain’t raise no cowards.”
>Jacobs voice reaches your ears
>”You’re not a coward, Sam. C’mon, just like we practiced. One good jump. Then I go. And then we go home. Okay? Just a good dodge.”
>You can hear the hurt and worry in his voice
>This isn’t like those other times
>This is under the eyes of that bastard father.
>When you look over, he’s standing next to Dad, his mouth set in a hard, determined line, as if to say ‘I know you can do this.’
>You can feel the ground start to tremble as the train presses little earthquakes into the tracks
>It’s getting closer
>That small bulb of light is now stretching its limbs
>Growing like a beam of sunshine shot through the darkness
>The horn blares
>The train rolls on
>Surely the conductor must see you standing there?
>What does it matter? It’ll take miles to stop
>Vomit rises in your throat and you start to choke
>You’re a coward
>A gut-puking coward
>The horn shrieks again
>You force the vomit back down into your gut
>You can’t move
>Oh fuck
>You can’t…
>…Can’t even think straight
>The train blows out of the tunnel in a hurricane of steel
>It’s barreling forward
>”GET READY!” Your brother calls
>You can barely hear him
>Or the train
>You can’t even feel the ground shaking anymore
>All you feel is that rush taking over your head
>Blood pulsing in your temples
>Heart racing in the thin cage of your chest
>Knees knocking one another
>And always the train racing against the tracks
>Draining fuel, chugging thick tendrils of black smoke
>Unstoppable…
>And the warm blood rush
>And your brother shouting “JUMP!”
>”JUMP!”
>JUMP!
>You feel the heat burning off its front, hear the ear-shattering blare of its horn, see the worried face of the conductor
>Its horn shrieks one last time
>Everything goes quiet
>And… You want it to hit you
>You want that oblivion
>J U M P
>With your eyes shut tight, you pretend you’re Samurai Outlaw
>And this is your tragic end at the hands of a diabolical villain
>But you’re too scared to even die, aren’t you?
>Too much of a coward to let this train hit you
>And yet, you can’t move
>”MOVE!”
>Unwilling in life to stand up for yourself
>Unwilling in death to die
>You’ll exist in a temporary stasis
>Just a few simple feet of track between you and oblivion while the train bolts forward, so close it begins sucking air from your lungs

>”SAM!”
>Jacob leaps…
>…Throws his full, protective weight at you…
>…Lunges forward, onto the tracks…
>…Knocking you to the other side…
>…Sending you crashing into the dirt
>Your father starts forward, and for the very first time in your entire fucking life, he looks scared
>Jacob sits up on the tracks
>His amber eyes meet yours with the most worried kindness you’ve ever seen
>And all you can see is relief spreading across his face, for just a fraction of a second
>His mouth starts working to say something, forming shapes and letters and syllables borne out of love
>And, as if he was never there to begin with, Jacob is gone in a storm of steel
>The train rolls on

>The cops ruled it as a suicide
>But you know it wasn’t
>When the nice human investigators came to your house, you followed along with what Dad told them
>”W-W-We tried t-t-to stop h-h-him,” you stammered, leg pounding anxiously into the air as you sit at the kitchen table
>You’ve never been tall enough to reach the floor
>You tried not looking them in the eyes. Somehow, you thought, they’d know it was you that killed him
>You washed up
>You brushed your fur
>You put on some of Jacob’s clean clothes (they smelled like him; they made you feel like he was still here to protect you)
>Had to look presentable for the officers, after all
>You tried talking loudly but your voice only came out in squeaks
>And in the back of your mind, sitting at the freshly cleaned table, you can only hear one word on repeat, over and over again, a nauseating carousel of unbridled and unkempt self-hatred: “murderer”
>”We’re deeply sorry for your loss,” the investigators say, almost in unison
>But it’s not that scripted, forced kind of sympathy either. They exude kindness
>One of them claps you softly on the shoulder, his deep blue eyes meeting yours
>Those eyes are drunk on starlight and concern, half closed, as if pressed down by the investigator’s heavy, troubled brow
>”Listen, if you ever feel like you need to talk to someone…” the friendly investigator produces a pamphlet from his back pocket “…Just call the number down here.” He points to a long telephone number with his pen
>You take the pamphlet from him with trembling little hands and look it over
>It seems to be about loss and grief
>The number is for a free counselor
>”The state offers resources to families like yours.”
>Your dad’s eyes are hard and set forward on the other officer, who seems to be regarding the kitchen with a modicum of disgust
>”So you’re saying he didn’t leave a note?” The other officer asks, curious
>”Nope, no note,” Dad returns in a calm breath. “Just up and got himself killed on those tracks”
>Jotting quick notes, the officer continues his assessment of your kitchen
>”How about his mother?” He holds an expectant breath as he meets Dad’s gaze
>”She’s gone,” Dad says sharp enough to cut the officer’s throat. “She was a cheat. Up and left. That’s all that happened.”
>The officer nods and mutters something to his partner, still scribbling notes with a free hand
>Dad’s eyes flick to the open notepad
>A scowl contorts his features. ”What, don’t you believe me? My own son is dead and you’re— you’re-”
>”Standard procedure. I just need to document all of this for my report, Mr. Garlen.” He jots a sentence shut and stares with disdain back at Dad
>Dad nudges you with his feet
>You understand his language
>The unspoken gestures
>All the language he makes out of violence
>He wants you to say something
“J-J-Jacob was a-a-always talking about… it… but I n-n-never thought he’d a-a-actually g-go through with… it…”
>God, you liar
>You’re worse than Dad
>You know you got your brother killed
>Dad knows
>You just want to hop up on the table and scream from the heavens ‘YES! I WAS THE ONE WHO GOT JAKE KILLED! IT WAS ME!’
>But you shrink further into your brother’s old hoodie without saying a damn fucking word
>The other, kinder officer, nods in approval. “Jesus, nobody should have to go through this. Nobody.” He rises from his seat. “Got everything, Clemens?”
>’Clemens’ follows suit
>”Yeah, I think that should do it.” His eyes sweep the kitchen one last time.
>They linger on Dad, and his mouth falls open, almost as if he’s about to say something
>Then his eyes flick over to you, shrunken in your seat, feeling like the smallest thing in the world
>He levels his pen towards you
>”Actually… Samantha? Can I speak with you in private?” He says
>Dad raises an eyebrow
>”What for?” He huffs
>Whatever semblance of pleasantness he put on was slipping down his face in the form of sweat
>The officer gives Dad a hard stare
>”I just want to speak to her.” He turns back to you and smiles sympathetically. “Is that alright?”
>…
>This might be your chance
>You could tell this officer everything
>All the years of neglect and abuse
>All the endangerment
>The scars and welts on your body and arms
>You could get out of here
>But you’d be getting out alone, wouldn’t you?
>No Jacob anymore
>Not after you killed him
>You don’t deserve anything
>Somewhere, deep inside, you fight down the urge to go back to the tracks yourself and hurl yourself in front of a train
>If only you weren’t such a goddamn coward
>Like the bug that you are, your eyes flick towards Dad
>His ashen face is cold with hatred
>You know exactly what he’s trying to say, all without ever having to utter a single word
>’Don’t make it worse for yourself’
>You look back at the officer, who waits expectantly
”N-N-N-No. I-I don’t t-t-think I can t-t-talk a-anymore about thi-this,” you say, throwing your face to the side to try to hide the lie in your eyes
>The officer frowns a bit, and then bites down on his bottom lip a bit
>”Well, if you ever want to talk to us, you have our card. And if you ever need to… talk… to someone, just call the number on the back of that pamphlet. Okay?”
>You can’t even look him in the eyes
“O-Okay.”
>The two officers turn and thank your dad
>”And again, we’re deeply sorry for your loss,” ‘Clemens’ says, before tipping his hat and heading out the front door
>It bangs shut, leaving only you and Dad in silence

>Dad watches as their car rolls on down the block and disappears around the corner where the streets have no name
>He turns to you, and you can see the fire in his eyes
>You push back from the table, the chair squealing in protest
>”Don’t you run, boy,” Dad says. “Not this time. Not this time.”
>’Boy’?
>”That’s right, ‘boy’, because you’re going to pay back what you stole from me.” His voice begins to break in a slurred staccato. “You’re going to give me my son back, you bitch.” 
>And for once in your life, you can see tears welling in your father’s sunken, bloodshot eyes
>They saturate his unwashed fur and burn a path down his cheeks
>You can’t be Jacob
>Jacob was too much like Dad
>And you’re nothing like that. But you can use what Jacob learned. You can be tough and strong and brave
>You think
>Dad advances forward
>”You bastard son of a bitch,” he says
>You try to stand at your full height and puff out your meager chest
>”And you ain’t even my kin,” he sobs loudly
>He enters the kitchen and pushes the table aside
>”Well, you smarmy cunt. One day you’re going to pay back what you owe. You’re going to pay me back-” his voice breaks. “-One way or another.”
>Your eyes shut tight and you tremble, still trying to hold yourself as tall as your brother once was
>But you’re not him
>You’re not brave or strong or fierce like Jacob
>You’re Samantha- no, SAM Garlen
>You’re weak, spineless, and you deserve everything that’s coming to you
“I-I’m sorry,” you whisper, though you don’t think Dad can hear you through the cloud of rage
>Your fingers reflexively clench onto the pamphlet the cops gave to you like it was some kind of life raft in a terrible storm
>And then the pain comes

>The weak light of Thursday, October 30th, pins warm pink tones to your inner eyelids
>You had just strayed into a waking dream, trapped in that purgatory between the full gravity of sleep and waking lucidity
>In truth, you hadn’t slept well
>Anxiety drove its barbs into you
>Earlier in the week it was one distraction after the other
>And this whole business happening on Friday night never felt real
>It felt like college — some kind of concept people whispered about while staring at the city from a high school rooftop — not an actuality that was approaching
>Like a storm on the horizon
>But now the sky is swollen and ready to empty its fury
>Friday was one day away from rearing its bald fucking head at you
>You had:
>The Behemoth
>The goths
>Sam’s Dad
>All out hunting for you right now
>All gearing up for Friday night
>And what did you have?
>A shopping cart full of garlic and squirt guns
>Oh, and Sam’s baseball bat in your trunk
>Speaking of Sam, the bunny is stirring in his sleep, murmuring half-sentences and clenching his body tight
>Your heart really does go out to the kid
>He’s really had a rough go of it, and all he wanted was to have one actual Halloween 
>You guess you’ve taken holidays for granted, because they’re, in a way, a symptom of a healthy and happy home life
>All this dumb bunny wanted was to have a little bit of what everyone else gets
>And now you’ve involved him in some weird cult and put his life in danger
>You  clutch your head as you feel a wave of guilt come over you, pounding in your temples like railroad spikes
>Dear God
>What have you done?
>All he wanted was one crummy dance with you
>YOU DON’T EVEN CARE ABOUT SCHOOL OR THIS SHIT, WOULD IT REALLY HAVE BEEN THE WORST THING TO SPEND ONE. FUCKING. NIGHT. WITH. HIM? 

>Before you can tear any further into yourself, Sam sits up and rubs sleep from his eyes, belting out a yawn
>You quickly scoot a heterosexual distance away from him
>He doesn’t seem to notice as he blinks himself awake
>”M-Morning,” he says, as if in a daze
>He might have slept, but it doesn’t appear to have been all that restful
>Bad dreams, maybe
>”Morning,” you say, making no effort to keep your voice low
>You check the time on your phone
>Plenty of time to kill before school
>Alex is still sawing logs, so you decide to let him peacefully sleep
>It’s the least you could do for your comrade after he rescued Mike
>Ah, and speaking of-
>Your gaze sweeps the church pews
>Jenna is weirdly absent
>You check the bathrooms (even the boy’s room) and she’s still missing
>Shit
>Did she ditch you guys in the middle of the night?
>…Would you blame her?
>You mean, you can understand the betrayal
>She’s involved now and had no good reason to be, other than wanting to save Mike
>Not like he needs saving anyway
>He’s not helpless anymore now that he’s partially given up on his future
>He’s drunk on that dumb, reckless nihilism that tends to infect people bereft of their hope and means of escape

>You and Sam slip out through the fire exit ‘round the back of the church
>Your lungs tingle as you fill them with frosted air
>You stand outside the church and watch as your your breaths disappear into thin clouds of vapor
>Sam makes like he’s blowing on a cigarette and pushes a steady knot of warm out from his chest
>You both watch it ascend and join back up with the clouds
>He looks up at you, giggling a little
>You smile despite the chill
>Wrapping your arms around your midsection and shivering in your thin fucking baseball t-shirt (good choice, idiot), you pace towards your car (parked like you’d gotten three margarita’s deep behind the wheel last night)
>You get about halfway across the parking lot when the sight of a busy fox-tail sticking out of the rear driver side door grinds your legs to a frosty halt
>Wat
>You hear Mike’s husky voice echo: “Hold it still, you’re getting it all over the upholstery.”
>Jenna replies: “I’m trying, but you’re shaking. Just… okay, hold on. How about now?”
>You don’t know why you did this, but you assume a crouched stance, evenly distributing your weight across your body
>Stealthy, like a fox (just not Jenna)
>”A-Anon-” Sam calls after you
>You hush Sam with a finger against his lips
>Jenna’s ears twist in your direction like a pair of antennas honing in on a signal
>Her tail, ordinarily swishing back and forth, freezes up, standing stiff and alert
>”Someone there?” Mike asks from inside the vehicle
>God knows what the fuck they’re doing inside the car
>YOUR CAR
>Jenna slides herself out of the car very slowly, her back facing you, fingers wrapped around her left wrist, as if she were pressing upon a wound
>You can guess her back is turned because she’s blushing
>Do vixens blush beneath the orange fur?

>She’s still wearing the same green sweater and pale blue jeans, but with her tail plastered between her legs, she looks more like a kid who just got caught looking at her christmas presents too early
>”Anon?” She says, slowly, her voice trembling, stumbling and striving for the courage to say-
“It’s not what it looks like?” You offer
>Mike slides easily out of the vehicle
>He wipes his palm across his mouth, and then onto his pants
>He evasively turns his head to the side and peers into the car?
>Why do they both look so guilt-
>”A-Are you okay?” Sam lurches forward. “Y-You’re b-bleeding…” he says in a low voice
>He weakly aims a finger at Jenna
>She still doesn’t turn around
>The vixen tries hiding her left wrist behind her body
>”I’m fine,” she blurts, her posture stiffening up to its full, pathetic height. “J-Just go back inside. Nothing to see here-”
>Bleeding?
>IN YOUR CA-
>Oh, bleeding
>You’re not a total idiot
>You look towards Mike in disgust
>Mike shrugs, still not meeting your gaze
>”She offered, I was hungry. I don’t see the problem,” he says, sounding almost embarrassed
“Oh fuck.” You take a small step backwards. “Does this mean you bit her? You sucked her blood? Is she going to turn into-”
>”Eww!” Jenna spins around, fury printed onto her features (and a touch of blush). She clutches her left wrist, but you can still see the blood seeping through the cracks between her claws
>”He didn’t /bite me/. I cut my wrist and… and…” her blush only reddens, like hot coals whose smolder had been stoked with gasoline
>Mike sticks his tongue out and points to it
>Ah, that makes some sense
>He… licked her arm
>Which is disgusting, but logical
>Sam is the first to react
>”T-That’s so sw-sweet,” he stammers. He looks up at you for entirely too long, as if to ask ‘would you do the same thing for me if I were a vampire?’
>You make a disgusted face and flick him lightly on the nose
>He shrinks back from you
>Jenna, on the other hand, seems less than thrilled. Still wearing her blush, she explains that Mike is an asset to the team and he needs to be taken care of
>You only buy that a little
>You suspect that there are some ulterior motives at play here, but don’t want to dig too deeply
“Well, if you’re all done bleeding into each other’s mouths, why don’t we wake Alex up and start talking about a plan,” you declare.
>”Fine by me,” Mike says, look very satisfied with both Jenna’s embarrassment and his satiation

>Alex is already up and eating a balanced breakfast of yesterday’s peanut butter cups
>He waves as you enter
>”Ahoy comrades. Care to share some breakfast with me?”
>Sam bounces forward, all too excited at the idea of having candy for breakfast
>Christ, he’s like a little kid
>Just wait until you guys go trick-or-treating…
>At some point, either before or after you stop Vanessa and The Behemoth and… Sam’s Dad…
>Your heart sinks to same depths as it did this morning when you were contemplating everything stacked against you
>But if Sam has those thoughts, they don’t seem to bother him
>”C-Can I h-have one?” he stutters, bounding down the aisles of the church, his words miles behind him
>Alex cocks back his arm and fires a wrapped chocolate at Sam’s head
>It donks off his forehead and lands at his feet
>The bunny is undeterred
>He skitters to a halt and pounces on it like a starved wolf, shucking the candy’s foil in visceral carnage and plopping the little chocolate nugget within into his mouth
>…Kid really likes sugar
>He doesn’t notice everyone staring at him until he stands up to find all eyes turned towards him
>He swallows nervously and forces his hands behind his back
>”S-Sorry. H-H-Hungry.”

>You manage to drag Alex outside to talk with Mike, which is no easy task
>Alex, the little (big) commie is lanky, tall, and has little to protect him from the jagged knife that is the cold, October morning breeze
>Now, assembled around your car (again), you pass the bag of candy around, Sam taking generous handfuls and stuffing them in his hoodie’s pockets
>You don’t mind
>Honestly, you’ve eaten enough chocolate for five Halloweens over
>…If you live that long
>And that depends on your next steps here
>You’ve got a decent idea, but you’re not sure everyone else would go for it
>”Anon, you wanna enlighten us as to what our next move is?” Mike says, not with an air of renewed vigor. “Because Alex looks like he’s going to freeze his ideologies off.”
>He looks less pale than before, his face and skin touched with color
>The blue veins that spider webbed beneath his porcelain skin seemed to have retracted or melded back into the warmth of his body
>Guess a little Type A in your system will do that to you
>Alex’s body is shaking and spasming with chills, but that’s what he fucking gets for wearing shorts and long sleeves and no jacket (not that you’re any better, you just have proper pants)
“Well hey we’re all wearing weather appropriate clothes, that’s not our fault.”
>”W-W-Worry not c-c-c-comrades,” Alex says, his teeth ramming together with every syllable, sounding like he was guillotining the words. “I’ve slaved at The Shop N’ Save in worse.”
>You nod at Comrade Alexi
>He is indeed a brave, dumb soldier
“Alright, I’ll try to keep this brief. Tomorrow is Halloween. And more importantly, tomorrow is the night of the Spooktober Fest — when the dark rite, ritual, what the fuck ever, can be completed. And also when it can be stopped. That’s our Death Star.”
>”D-Death Star?” Sam says
>”Do-Don’t te-tell me y-y-you haven’t s-s-seen Star W-Wars either,” Alex chatters
>The rabbit hangs his head in embarrassment
>”Jesus Christ,” Mike whistles. “We gotta get this kid up to speed when we’re done.”
>”Anon, please continue,” Jenna smiles, obviously not interested in being out in the cold either, despite her fur and sweater
>You nod 
“Right. So we’re going to that dance-party-function-thing. All of us.”
>A bright gleam leaps up into Sam’s eyes. ”W-We are?”
>Surprisingly, everyone nods in agreement
>You expected more resistance than this
>Well, to be fair, your plan is extremely basic
>With a slight twist
“And I’m also proposing that we go in costume shopping after school,” you say, expecting similar agreement
>Mike stuffs his hands into his pockets
>”Why? I’m too damn old to do that shit still,” he says
“Two reasons: one, we’ll have to infiltrate the Spooktober Fest in costumes so we don’t instantly get caught by Vanessa and the others. And two…” 
>You look down at Sam, whose eyes are shining at the idea of getting to wear a costume
>You quickly glance up and hope nobody notices your pleased smile
>”…There is no second reason. We just go.”
>Well, there is actually a second reason
>You’re going to give Sam as close to a normal Halloween as you can get at your age
>But then again, your best Halloween memories are only scant recollections of traditional holiday fare — trick-or-treating, dressing up, carving pumpkins — the real memories began when you and Mike and Alex would fuck around, get drunk, play vidya, puke into each other’s sinks and pass out in your basement
>Is a storybook holiday really right for him? Maybe a party with kids his age would help diversify his experience
>You look down again quickly, and Sam is wearing the cutest, dopiest grin across his effeminate face
>Yeah, at least costume shopping will be good for him
>Mike seems less than thrilled at the idea
>”I’m 18. I’m too old to be doing this crap. What, you wanna go trick-or-treating next?”
“We’re all 18,” you say, “and I don’t hear anyone else objecting.” 
>He crosses his stubby arms across his chest in casual defiance. ”Well, I don’t have any costume ideas. And I want something cool.”
>A smile creases your lips
>Mike looks like he’s seen something wretched
>You dig into your back pocket and draw out two neatly folded sheets of notebook paper
>You unfold them — Sam’s drawings from Tuesday — and hold them up for everyone to see, like you’d just found the map to some buried treasure
“Sam’s already got costume ideas for all of us.” 

>School rushes by in an orange blur, and really, you do mean an orange blur
>As the administration preps for the Spooktober Fest, everything gets a fresh coat of orange and black plastic varnish
>Fake jack-o-lanterns line the hallways (where they remain upright and not filled with trash by the students for a good hour)
>Streamers hang from rafters
>Someone set up a scarecrow outside the front entrance, complete with a smiling pumpkin face that certainly doesn’t broadcast terror or fear
>You have to remind yourself that this is a public school function
>Its been neutered of any true culture and color
>The only really scary things are the budget cuts this time of the year
>The custodial staff (really, just Stella) hauls tables into the gym while volunteer students and teachers and haul ‘sp00ky’ supplies from the equipment room, which include a gigantic fog machine, some fake gravestones, and even a faux skeleton
>Yep, it was going to be a major suckfest, and be about as fun as a school-sanctioned event can be

>Though while you’re tailing Sam (again) the whole day, you do overhear a convenient little piece of information outside of Sam’s class
>Four preps, humans and neatly dressed with clean sweater and sharp haircut to match their even sharper tongues, are loudly discussing the one thing that high school kids care more about than getting the FUCK out of their hometown: where to acquire tons of alcohol for tonight’s costume party at one of their fancy suburban homes
>And this ain’t like your house, no, the homes where the preps come from makes your house look like Sam’s
>The idea of a party intrigues you
>You’ve never been to one before, at least, put on by kids your own age
>Were they as full of debauchery as the movies say they are?
>Also, you have nothing really going on tonight other than get costumes…
>God, it’s your last year in high school EVER
>Why shouldn’t you show up, get plastered and make an anonymous ass out of yourself?
>You’ll bring the whole gang
>Especially Sam, who has probably NEVER been to party in his life
>…Yeah, you’ll do it for him, you lie to yourself

>You pen down the address on your hand, and then later transfer it to your phone right as the bell kicks itself and students saturate the hallways
>Sam is the last out the door (as usual), lagging behind a particularly mean looking panther jock, buttoned up in his letterman's jacket that screams ‘I peaked in high school!’
>But the large feline pays no attention to you, and instead directs a death glare at the four assembled preps
>Ah yes, the two natural enemies of high school life — preps and jocks
>One group had money, the other group had brawn
>You’re not sure why any of that really matters, but people are superficial
>And in a less-than-superficial gesture, the preps fire back at the panther with a few raised middle fingers

>”Oh fuck off, cunts,” the panther directs a rolling growl in their direction
>You casually step to the side and fold yourself against a locker
>You pull Sam against you and shimmy away as fast as you can
>This could get ugly very quickly
>Everyone is at each other’s throats this week, thanks to Vanessa
>One of the preps steps forward
>”What are you going to do about it, razor mouth?”
>This does enough to spike the Panther’s blood pressure
>Yep, time for you to go
>You’ve endured enough supernaturally prompted aggression for the rest of your life
>With Sam trailing closely behind you (not like he has much choice), you steer your way down the hallway, nudging past students who (appropriately) nudge back
>With all the strength your skelly body can muster, you manage to stay upright as you’re jostled to and fro by bodies in motion
>Sam seems to have plenty of experience getting knocked around, so he’s a lot better at staying on his feet and dodging wayward elbows
>When you look behind you, you see the crowds parting for a teacher and school resource officer (and really, they’re just cops) sprinting down the hall, shoving through throngs of teenagers, heading back to where the panther and the preps were
>Guess you were right
>It did get ugly

>Battered plenty, you’re able to make it down the stairs, to the lunchroom, and then out to the parking lot where the kiss of cold air against your skin is a relief from the sweltering heat inside
>Sam seems to agree, as he tugs at the collar of his hoodie with his one free hand, letting out some trapped heat
>Strangely enough, you don’t see anyone you need to avoid other than angry students 
>No goths
>No Sam’s Dad
>No Stella
>Just cars in motion, kids cutting each other off, clusters of teenagers strutting around, looking for something to sate their boredom
>On the way to your car, you steer clear of a group of punks, but they only offer ‘fuck you looking at?’ glances from behind the curling cigarette smoke trailing off their lips
>You see Mike waiting on the hood of your car like he owns it
>Jenna is at his side, talking to him
>Neither of them notice your approach 
>Mike must have cracked a joke, because Jenna slouches in her ordinarily rigid and prim stance
>She throws her vulpine head back and laughs from her belly
>You think that’s called gekkering for foxes? But you’re not sure
>And when she recovers, she absent-mindedly runs her fingers through the fur on the top of her head, twisting it earnestly while Mike prattles on about something you can’t hear
>As you approach, Mike throws a quick glance at you and the bun
>His cheer seems to drain to a half-smile, as if he were glad to see you, but you had interrupted something important
>”There’s the chauffeur and his sidekick,” he says with a weak laugh
>He seems… in good cheer
“Nice to see you too, Edward.”
>”Edward?” Mike tilts his head
“Nevermind, you don’t read,” you fire back quickly
>Jenna giggles. “Well probably not those types of books.”
>She puts a lot of stress on the word ‘those,’ drawing your curiosity
“So you read trashy young adult fiction too?” You prod
>”I live for it. I’d get The Deathly Hallows tattooed on my arm if I could… you know… see it under all of this fur.”
>You internally wince
>You can hear your inner elitist yelling:
>’Who, past the age of 12, reads Harry Potter?’
>Thankfully Mike silences your inner critic counters by calling you both ‘book reading morons,’ promptly ending the discussion

>”Guess we’re just waiting on Comrade Alexi,” Mike observes from the back seat
>He’s sitting in the middle seat, squeezed up close to Jenna, who doesn’t seem to mind
>Sam is in the passenger seat, as usual
“Guess so…” you observe, drawing out the last syllable so you can ease your transition into your next request
>Smooth like butter, you can taste the transition on your tongue
“….Hey, wouldn’t it be fun if we… I don’t know… went to a costume party?” You propose, your voice stumbling into a pathetic whisper
>So much for your initial success with the transition
>Mike seems to hear it well enough, though
>”A costume party? Like at the school? Fuck no-”
“Not at the school,” you interject, before he kills your idea. “At someone’s house. I think it’s happening at Braydon Smith’s place tonight.”
>The car is silent, and the sudden guilt you feel burdens you like a millstone around your neck
>Really, it’s a selfish request
>You just want to go to the party because you’ve never been to one
>And because Sam needs to have an experience! A good one! Something that reminds him Halloween isn’t just trick-or-treating and fake fog machines and happy scarecrows
>”Will there be booze?” Mike asks
>”What? Hell no, count me out if there’s underage drinking.” Jenna crosses her arms across her chest in a pout
>Mike issues a snort of laughter. “So you’ll steal a shopping cart and five pounds of garlic, but you won’t drink with us?”
>Jenna reddens. “I-I left a $20 at the counter, so it’s alright.”
>”Whatever. If there’s booze I’m in. Not like we had any plans tonight.”
>Your eyes shift from Jenna to Mike
>She frowns
>”Well, I’m not drinking.”
>”PERFECT!” Mike practically jumps in his seat. “You can be the driver. Anon, Sam, Alex and I will make sure we handle most of the liquor. I’ll drink enough for the both of us.”
>You pass a look down at Sam, who seems apprehensive, given that he’s thoughtfully stroking his ears, threatening to tug on them 
>You do your best attempt at a reassuring smile
“It’ll be fun. I want you to have something close to a normal Halloween experience. Okay?”
>He flashes a nervous smile
>”O-Okay,” he says, but you can hear the mistrust, which sounds like little silvery knives in your heart

>Alex arrives well after the rest of the cars are gone
>His light brown hair curls down in uneven tangles from his golden beanie — disheveled from exhaustion
>And the rest of him is a sweaty mess
>His ordinarily pale cheeks look flush with color and exhaustion, and as he limps across the blacktop, you can see that he’s wearing damp sweat stains underneath his long maroon shirt
>He throws open the door without a word and grunts his way next to Mike
>”Where the hell have you been?” Mike asks
>Jenna and Sam both pinch their nose in unison, as if they were following lines from a script
>”Ghrisd,” Jenna says, her  voice a high, nasally whine. “Ydou reeg,”
>”Huh?” Alex says, barely perceiving anything as he throws his head back against the seat
>His chest heaves
>The vixen unplugs her sensitive nose. “I said you REEK.”
>”Oh.” 
>Alex hears the complaint, but doesn’t seem to register it
>You snap your fingers at the poor kid in some attempt to bring him back to reality
>It seems to reel him back in enough for an exhausted explanation
>”Coach Griswald made me run an extra mile today for calling him a fascist.” His voice comes out in tired puffs
>”Nice one, dude.” Mike says
>”Ygou woudnd gnow whad fagscism is iv id pud ids bood on ur negg.” Jenna says
>Alex rolls against the door panel and shuts his eyes. “Fascist,” he whispers to the door panel, who whispers nothing back but the cold rattle of loose metal as you twist your keys into the ignition
>You’ve wasted enough time here

>Imagine the most generic Halloween movie soundtrack possible, and you’d have a rough approximation of what’s playing overhead at the costume store
>For the first time in what feels like a very long time, you are assailed by corny ghost moans and anything-but-bone-shaking thunder
>And the cherry on top?
>Squealing bat sound effects that sound like they got ripped from 1960s Scooby-Doo reruns on TV
>As the sliding door opens, and all these sounds strike you in one aural gut-punch, you breathe deeply and squeeze your eyes shut
>You’re home, back in your memories
>You’re a little kid again, trying to find a costume that will draw the least amount of attention because you didn’t know, back then, that you had a crippling fear of judgement
>Mike shrugs past you, aiming to get this over with as soon as possible, tossing you out of the nostalgia
>Jenna is close behind him, but the glow of joy in her eyes is enough to tell you that she’s plenty excited to be here, and not out stealing things from a liquor store, like Mike had initially suggested

>Sam bounces from clothing rack to clothing rack, grabbing packages and pre-made costumes, turning them over in his tiny hands like they were precious gems
>From a firefighter to a skeleton to an anime character… he seems immensely pleased by all of it
>It’s like he’s been dosed with rocket fuel. You’ve never seen him so reckless and excited
>And as you dig through a bin of shitty plastic props and discount costumes, you can’t help but smile
>You feel like you’re doing the right thing

>You’re sorting aside discount costumes (mostly just wigs with gum in them) when you hear Sam beside you, breathing hard from exhaustion in little wheezes
>You straighten your back and look down
>The bunny has no less than 10 separate costume pieces stacked high, burdening his already thin arms
>”A-A-Anon,” he stutters, nearly out of breath. “I-I-I want to t-t-t-try these on.”
>… It’s not like he needs your permission
>Oh
>Wow
>He’s probably been clothes shopping once or twice in his life
>Jesus Christ that’s surreal
>You take clothes shopping for granted every time you go
>Does he…
>Need instructions?
“Go find the changing room,” you tell him, as you pick a package of cheap ‘priest vestments’ from the refuse of the discount bin
>He throws you a confused glance at the mention of the word ‘changing room’
>”W-W-What is that?”
>You’re not sure if this is irritating or adorable
“It’s a room where you get naked and try on the costumes,” you say, trying to dismiss him so you can find your other co-conspirators
>When you got into the store you all fanned out in alternate directions
>Except Sam, who clung to you like he was glued to your hip
>He really likes hanging around you, you tell yourself
>Or he’s getting really touchy
>One of the two
>Sam looks unsure of his instructions
>You groan internally and point a lazy finger towards a hanging sign that says ‘changing rooms’
>Sam fixes you with a ‘I’m sorry’ look, and then bounds off in the direction of the changing rooms, jockeying his stack of costumes
>What the hell does he even need those for?
>The designs he came up with for himself —  ‘Samurai Outlaw’ — couldn’t be simpler: a hoodie, some baggy pants, a bandana, and a baseball bat
>Whatever
>Let the kid have his fun
>You smile at the thought of Sam getting to finally enjoy what you’ve taken for granted for years
>You hold the costume you picked — a priest’s robes — up to the light
>It’s fairly standard — there’s a picture of a rhino wearing them, and despite the rhino’s size, the long, flowing, cheap cut of cloth hangs off his arms and around his waist in huge swaths
>They’re primarily an off yellow, sickly like vomit, with a definite gold stripe running down the center of the piece with two lines branching towards your shoulder, like a ‘Y’ with a spike down its center
>They match Sam’s drawing for you
>The kid has talent, that much is true
>But the costume is a scant reflection of Sam’s vision
>In fact, like all Halloween costumes, it’s cheaply made, and the cut is a bit large
>You’ll have to go try it on

>As you make your way to changing rooms, you pass by Alex
>He smirks and pulls the brim of a fedora lower, having tossed his signature yellow beanie aside
>His whole body is clad in cheap cloth that’s been textured to look like a striped suit
>But you know? The cut is tapered in at the sides and shoulder, so from a distance, he really does look like some kind of 20s-30s gangster
>The fedora tho, invokes your inner elitist again
>Too much time on the internet
>”Nyyeeh sheeee,” he says in the worst accent you’ve ever heard
>The utterance of those words causes something physical to seize up inside you
“Listen, Alex, comrade… Never say that again like that, okay?”
>He nods in agreement
>”Save my charisma for Friday. Gotcha.” He winks at you
“That’s not what I meant, but aright. Save it for Friday.”
>”Was it good?” He asks, already having decided for himself it was Oscar-worthy
>You agree with him, in the way that a parent agrees with their child when they say they’re going to grow up to be ‘The President of the Moon’
“Don’t change a thing, Alexi.”
>He fires dual finger guns back at you, and you almost wish they were real so you can be spared an encore performance
>You can feel a shiver still running up your spine as you pace off towards the changing rooms
>If only you were dead

>There’s only two available changing rooms
>Hmmm
>You try the one on the left and get a metal rattle as the lock catches
“Sorry,” you say, face going flush with blood
>You probably just scared the piss out of someone who is stark naked in there, trying on a slutty ‘nerd’ costume or something
>But the response you get back is as empty as your wallet is about to be
>There’s sadly no dividers for your voice to carry over
>The sound isolation must be insane
>These are just closed-in rooms with mirrors pasted onto walls and signs that say ‘changing room’ glued on the windowless doors
>Classy
>Alright, Sam must be in the one on the left, you reason
>Meaning you’ve got the one on the right to try
>You find it’s not locked, and you hear no voices of protest as you crack open the door
>Good!

>You twist the nob and slip inside, snapping off the endless chime of cheap Halloween sound effects as the door shuts with a meaty *thunk*
>A distinct, girlish falsetto shrieks behind you

>You don’t even think about the consequences of what you do next, because your body moves autonomously
>You don’t consider how turning around changes your life almost completely in less than a fraction of a second
>So much can happen in the resonate space between heartbeats
>A car wrapping around a tree, impaling the driver who held his eyes down at his wheel for one pulse too many
>A baby’s first, catching lungfulls of air, and the exhaustive sigh of the mother who was told her son would be a stillborn
>The small gap between the barrel of a gun and the temple is one heartbeat across
>This is one of those moments

>You turn around and behold Sam Garlen, who has one bulbous leg down the throat of a pirate costume’s trousers, and is standing, otherwise, stark naked, all of his clothes scattered around him in a pile
>”A-A-A-Anon!?” He shrieks, voice rising and rising in pitch
>But his words bounce off your useless eardrums 

>Your eyes sweep over him, up and down, focusing on absolutely everything all at the same time, soaking in the near-flatness of his chest, the slenderness of his shoulders, but also the play of the overhead light on his body, like he was the lone actor in a very bright spotlight, directing your eyes downward
>And downward
>Past the pink of his nipples, the meager puff of his breasts, the slender and exposed bones of his ribs (still mysteriously bruised)
>Down the tuck of his midsection, pinched inward…
>…Which only emphasizes the girlish bow of his hips…
>…To the pink slit of his sex, begging for a gentle hand to spread it like a flower that only blossoms in the fall
>And then you look up at him, feeling drugged, completely senseless, like your head was a balloon floating away from the stalk of your neck
>And then you open your mouth
>And you say the DUMBEST fucking thing anyone could possibly say in a situation like this
“Dude, where’s your dick?”

>He?
>He has no?
“Are you a eunuch?” You say
>Where’s his dick lmao
“Sam? Do you hear me? I’m- I’m trying- where is your dick, man?”
>Sam isn’t hearing you
>His face is pulsing bright red, his jaw heavily slacked downward
>Powerful tremors shake through him and dislodge words and thoughts from the hollows of his skull
>And even though he looks like he’s just been shot, he doesn’t move to cover himself 
>And neither do you, because there’s a block in your ability to process things right now
>Your eyes mindlessly flick between his bare groin and the way his eyes explode out of his face, and then to a circular scar encrusting his right shoulder, like a vivid burn mark
>Your brain is doing the analytical equivalent of 2+2=5
>You open your mouth to ask him where his dick is agai-

>Sam plummets backwards like a statue cleaved off of its stand
>You watch him crash, unable to will your body to move and try to prevent his oncoming concussion
>All it takes is one heartbeat
>You hear his skull bounce off the floor with a dampened *pomf*
>And you stand there like some kind of leaden idol, feeling nothing but your heart pounding
>Looking at nothing but the pile of poofy pirate pants and Sam laying on the floor, unconscious
>And thinking nothing except “where’s her dick?”

>You drown in the pinks of your eyelids, eyes shut, as if to reset your nervous system
>Wow
>It’s roomy behind your eyes and above your throat
>Lotttaaaa empty space
>Maybe the distant echo of your inner-self pounding his head against an imaginary wall
>Dunno

>Did that really happen?
>You bend your fingers inwards, squeezing them into a weak fist
>Then you wiggle your toes
>You can… move
>Yeah
>When you open your eyes, Sam is still there in that pile of himself(herself?)
>Still dickless
>You creep over to him(her?) as if your feet were made of fragile glass
>He(she?) still has his(her?) right leg halfway into a pair of canvas-white pirate pants
>Your eyes travel upwards from the pants
>You know that’s only a distraction from the real investigation you’re trying to conduct
>Steeling yourself, you let your gaze settle on his(her?) crotch
>…
>Yep
>That’s EXACTLY what you think it is
>You swallow hard, and your mind feels like it’s trying to rebuild itself after being reduced to a chunky, dysphoric slurry
>So… the whole time… Sam has been a girl?
>He- shit, SHE has kept it under wraps this whole time? Why?
“Why the hell…? What’s the point of hiding this?”
>You want to wake her up
>You want to grab her and shake her and ask why she’d keep this from you, and what it put you through
>Instead, you do the next best (and right) thing
>Your feet barely touch the ground as you tip-toe to the opposite side of the dressing room, all the while keeping one eye on Sam
>She still has shock pressed into the lines of her young face, which looks more feminine than before — less angled and softer at the cheeks and at the jaw
>But her eyes are clamped down and her mouth is screwed shut, and, thanks to the her decision to strip bare, you can see her meager chest rising and falling with unconscious grace
>It’s like watching a very small and weak balloon inflate and then deflate
>It takes everything in you not to try to stir her awake
>Watching her fall unconscious was hard enough
>But this… this was like standing by, helpless, while a beautiful bird with broken wings drifts struggles uselessly to take flight again
>You want to rescue her
>But you don’t. You do what you think you should
“Please don’t wake up, please don’t wake up, please don’t wake up,” you beg the unconscious bunny, whose eyes scrunch together and whose brow furrows
>She looks like she’s in pain
>You hover over her, holding her ratty old hoodie
>Sweat beads from your forehead and down the bridge of your nose, threatening a high-dive onto Sam’s own forehead
>You drape her ratty old hoodie across her rounded hips, hovering over her body like a crane trying to defuse a small bomb
>And all the while, you keep flicking your gaze over to her bare crotch and the pink slit that is her sex
>You still can’t believe it
>You swear, the next time you blink, you’re going to wake back up in your bed on Friday night of last week
>And all of this is going to be a dream
>There will be no horrible plot to destroy the earth
>Mike will be normal
>You will have never have fought
>Your house will have never been destroyed
>You will have never made that pact with the goths
>You will have never stolen Sam
>In fact
>When you wake up, you’ll still hate him… her…?
>You layer the hoodie gently across her lower half  as she begins to stir
>When will you wake up?

>You don’t wake up
>She does
>Little slivers of rusted gold peer up at you, shuddering with dim recognition
>Her mouth starts to move, and you freeze, hovering over her, obscuring her in your shadow
>”I’m s-s-sorry.”
>You take a safe step backwards, face burning with hot blood
“I don’t understand,” you say, trying not to look at her. You direct your eyes anywhere but at her
>Sam props herself up on her palms, still shaking
>”P-Please…”
>She makes a spinning motion with her fingers
“Oh, right! Christ, I’m such an idiot.” Berating yourself feels like the only sensible thing you can do right now (other than turning around)
>You do a sharp spin and face the corner like a child who’s being punished
>Sam pulls on her boxers first, then hoodie, and then sweats — none of which are done with anything resembling speed or urgency
>Mostly just defeat
>”O-O-Okay, y-y-you can turn a-a-around.” The sadness in her voice is almost as powerful as your shame
>And your curiosity
>When you face her, she’s still the same old Sam you’ve known for years
>The Sam who you’ve grown to call a friend
>The Sam you care about
>The Sam that still furiously blushes when you so much as lay a finger on her
>This may be the same bunny, but you can sense a change
>So you’ve gotta know now
>But first, something very important:
“I’m… REALLY sorry, Sam. I didn’t mean to barge in on you like that. I though you were in the room next to this one, and… I don’t really have a good explanation other than the fact that I’m a fucking idiot.”
>Sam points her eyes downward at her feet
>”I-I-It’s okay. O-Or, I m-mean, it’s n-not okay. I do-don’t know. I do-don’t kn-know anything.” 
>There’s an awkward pause, where you’re staring hard at Sam but she’s focusing all of her attention into avoiding eye contact
>Guess it’s now or never
“Why?” You say, and you think you know what to say next, but your tongue seems to swell in your mouth
>Nothing comes out but stupid noise and the hissing of your throat
>She forces her hands behind her back to try and abstain from pulling at her ears
>”W-What?”
“Why. Why did you keep this from me? Does Jenna know?”
>Ah, truth at last
>She shakes her head, sweeping her bangs into her eyes
>”N-Nobody kn-knows ex-except Dad.”
“Just dressing and acting like a guy is one thing, but pretending to be one? Are you trans?”
>You pause
>Was that the wrong thing to say? Shit
>What are you supposed to say when someone comes out to you
“Because I swear I won’t be mad at you if you are. I’m just confused. Help me understand.”
>Again she shakes her head
>”I-I’m not… no… I do t-t-this be-because…”
>Her eyes start to blaze in the light, and you can see the frustration pressed into her face
>Maybe this was a mistake
>Actually, not maybe. This whole thing is predicated on your mistake
>Well, you better make it right you fucking moron
“You don’t need to tell me-”
>”Be-Because m-m-my br-brother is d-dead-d-d-dead-”
>Gentle sobs start to clip the last of her syllables
“I know. You must have really loved hi-”
“bBec-c-cause of m-m-me,”
>Wat
>”I k-killed him.”

>Wow
>You felt that one like a lead fist in the ribs
>Right about where your dusty old heart shudders and pumps dried blood
>She looks like she wants to cry, but isn’t allowing herself to
>Not yet
>She wipes her nose with a snotty sleeve
>Her voice plummets into a hoarse whisper
>”J-J-Jacob tried to m-make me tough a-and st-strong- so I could s-stand up for m-myself.”
“You ARE tough and strong! With all the shit you go through-”
>Now you see something you haven’t ever seen before:
>An angry Sam
>”GIRLS A-A-AREN’T STRONG!" She blazes, chest heaving. “G-Girls are w-w-weak and I-I have to b-be strong. I-I h-have to b-be strong f-f-for J-Jacob… I h-have to be the s-s-s-son my d-d-d-dad d-didn’t get to h-have.”
>She doesn’t strangle her ears this time around
>Instead, she tightens all of her anger and remorse and sadness between her fingers and closes her fists around them
>You just stand there, feeling limp and useless
>And more than that:
>Guilty
>She looks at you, flush in the face, chest swelling with hot air that she pushes in and out with each ragged breath
>You’re not sure if she’s going to start yelling again
>But she doesn’t
>She looks at you one last time with that fire in her eyes, and then…
>She slams her eyes shut — hard
>She shakes her head, throwing her dangling ears around violently, trying to dislodge her confusing and conflicting thoughts 
>Her fingers spread outward, and her body stops trembling, like a rocket struggling to fire off the launch pad
>All that’s left between you two is silence, the sound of Sam trying to get her breathing under control
>And outside the door, the muffled drone of Halloween music marches a steady beat

>Now is the time to say something, because this silence is worse than driving pins and needles into your skin
>It’s selfish
>You know that?
>It’s selfish to want to distract yourself from this pain
>Maybe it’s something you need to face, for yourself
>For Sam
>”I-I’m sorry,” she says weakly. “I d-don’t… I d-d-didn’t mean to s-s-shout.”
>Now it’s your turn to sigh
>God it’s such a relief
>You don’t know if you could handle Sam being mad at you
“The only thing you have to apologize for is not thinking you’re strong. God damnit, kid, you’re tougher than me and Mike and Alex combined. I don’t know how you got it in your head that you’re weak… that you need to replace your brother, or anything like that.”
>Sam looks wounded, but you carry on
“I have spent my entire life up until Tuesday afternoon being a gutless coward. I don’t see myself in you — not even a little bit.”
>”B-But you s-s-saved me from m-my d-d-dad. Y-You d-d-did wh-what I couldn’t,” she counters. And it’s a fair counter — if you leave out the fact that you were aided by a supernatural curse
>You shake your head
“That wasn’t me. Or, it wasn’t the real me. Everything brave and important I’ve ever done has been because I sacrificed Gloria Duchene to the goths. But not anymore. On Tuesday, I made that choice to quit living like a fucking coward.”
>You pause, searching for a truth in the vacant silence
>You’re not tough
>Not an asshole
>Not strong
>You only know one thing:
“I’m scared of everything,” you say with a heavy sigh. You turn your eyes away from her. “Why do you think I haven’t decided on my future yet, or sacked up and picked a college? Why do you think we’re hiding in a church instead of out looking for your dad to confront him? Christ, Sam, there’s a million things I wish I could say to you right now, but they die on their way out. But every day I get a little stronger. Every day I learn more and more what I’m capable of.”
>You squat down and meet her height
>Her eyes are still and fixed on your own
“I keep telling myself, if Sam can hit her dad with a baseball bat, then I can make it through until tomorrow — even if it kills me.” 
>Neither you, nor the rabbit, say anything for awhile
>You stare into one another
>And at one point, you swear, you traded brains for a second
>And a brain is a private, intimate place
>You felt what it was like to have someone wander around in the garden of your thoughts and memories
>First violation, then admittance, and then wonder
>And you, too, spent what felt like an hour inside of Sam’s mind, uprooting her pain, hearing distant rushes of train whistles felling forests and arcing blows of fists across your tender bone
>And then the connection severed
>You retrieved yourself from Sam, and her from you, and you tried desperately to memorize all that you had seen or done
>Sam must have felt the yank of separation, the cascade of sensory data overwhelming her synapses, because at last she blinked
>And then you blink, staring lucidly into one another’s eyes, but seeing more than just your own reflections
>Your eyes lock on her lips pink lips — the color of a ripe peach
>And you lean forward
>She shudders, her eyes falling shut in resignation
>Of mind first
>Then of body

>…
>You pull back at the last possible second, your lips a hair’s width from brushing one another
>When you open her eyes, her lips are still curled, her eyes still shut
>Waiting for you
>And you are full of shame

>The minute you retreat back into yourself, you feel the immense weight of guilt and shame
>Shoulda done it when you had the chance
>Coward
>No
>Not now
>Not here
>This isn’t the time, nor the place
>You’re glad you didn’t
>Sam’s eyes flutter open, and you see her flash a look of confusion
>And then the shame comes
>She throws her head downwards, her shoulders sloping with her gaze
>”I-I-” she starts, but you’re not going to allow her to do this to herself
>She’s too good of a person, drowning there in her hand-me-down hoodie and sweats, ears lopping carelessly behind her crop of hair that you’ve come to find beautiful on her
“Your secret is safe with me,” you say, trying to cut the tension
>”It…” she stops herself, uncertain in her next fumbling words
>”I-It doesn’t have t-t-to be a s-s-secret anymore.”
>Wat
“… Are you sure? You want people to know?”
>She hesitates for a moment
>And then, drawing herself up with a deep breath, she fixes you with a determined stare
>”Yes.” Her voice is steady as steel

>You gather a sharp-dressed Alex, a Jenna dressed like a bumblebee, and Mike, who has done little more than acquire a slick leather jacket that’s slightly too big for his frame, outside the costume shop 
>You’re dressed up in your white priest vestments, which are a loose cut of pale-yellow cloth with cheap gold thread running down the center
>Beneath that, you have a white robe, and Gloria’s crucifix dangling around your neck
>You look like a priest, if the Catholic Church were in a severe budget crisis
>”You two done making out yet?” Mike groans. “It’s getting dark and I’m getting hungry.”
>Indeed, the sunlight was dissolving away into the blue dusk
>People were inside having dinner by now with their families, so the clean-swept sidewalks were barren
>Meaning the party was going to be soon
>The one you were all crashing
>That harvest moon was rising, huge like another earth looming overhead
“Quit yer’ bitchin’, my son.” You waggle a finger at Mike, who playfully bites the air around it
>Jenna giggles
“I helped Sam with HER costume, so it took awhile,” you say, taking care to really draw out the ‘HER’
>You sweep the group with your eyes, looking expectantly from face to face
“I said, I helped Sam with HER costume, so it took awhile.”
>This silence tastes like need-smarter-friend-juice
>They don’t seem to understand
>Except Jenna, who cocks her head
>The sharp ears on top of her head twitch with curiosity, like a live wire jumping with current
>You lean forward
>Here it comes
>The big moment
>
>”It took you THAT LONG to get him his costume? What is he going as anyway?” She says
>”I bet his costume is really elaborate. Lots of moving parts. Did you cop a five-finger-discount on it?” Alex says
>…
“Actually,” you start, “you’re not even wrong. The costume was almost free. We just had to buy a little rope for HER bat.”
>Mike, that pale motherfucker, shivers, and says: “why do you keep saying it like that?”
>Bingo
“Like what?”
>The vampire fledgling folds his arms across his chest
>”’Her.’ You keep saying that instead of ‘him.’ Say it right, man. I’m too cold to deal with this.”
“Ah, you stupid bitch. Maybe there’s a reason for that?” You prod
>Jenna’s face lights up with a sudden alarm
>”You’re not messing with us, right?” She says, eyes going wide. “Are you saying what I’m thinking you’re saying?”
>You fight to keep the smile growing on your face from betraying your pointless ruse
>The fox shakes her head. “You’re just messing with us. Right?”
>Her pleading expression and Mike/Alex’s cluelessness is the straw that breaks the camel’s back

“Okay Sam, you can come out now!” You call

>The bunny totters around the corner of the building, trying her best to keep her hands away from her ears and to keep the blush from overpowering her ‘costume’
“I give you: Samurai Outlaw.”
>You gesture towards Sam like she were a prize on a game show and you were a beautiful hostess

>She stands before you all, as short and as self conscious always
>Her hood is thrown over her head, with two holes sliced out of the top so her ears can dangle down behind her 
>And a red bandanna obscures every feature of her face except the amber glow of her eyes
>Her brother’s baseball bat is strapped to her back with a bit of rope and cord
>Other than that, not much has changed about her
>It’s a simple costume, but dead close to her idealized drawing of Samurai Outlaw

>”Is that it?” Mike says
>You scowl
“Don’t you think it’s cool?” You say, ignoring his jab
>”I mean, it’s pretty simple, is all. I don’t know why it took you guys so long.”
>”I think it’s really fucking cool,” Alex says, encircling the rabbit, who is frozen in the metaphorical spotlight
>Too much attention on her all at once
>Jenna is dead-frozen, staring fixedly at Sam
>”She really does look… good…” she says, stiff and distant, her mind trying to reconnect its crossed wires
>”Awww not you too,” Mike says, now encircling Sam with Alex, like two sharks honing in on a bleeding whale
>He’s a little more interested than he lets on, you think
>The simplicity of Sam’s design is its main strength
>You could see Samurai Outlaw as some kind of urban antihero or something in a comic book
>Sam flinches and shrinks away from the prying eyes of Mike and Alex as they comment on how cool the baseball bat prop is
>Jenna loudly clears her throat, drawing everyone’s attention from Sam’s bare-bones costume
>”Sam,” she says, a cautious warmth tinting her words. “Is what Anon says true?” She threads her fingers together and folds her hands down at her waist
>The bunny points her eyes down at her feet in response to the sudden question
>You open your mouth to spill the metaphorical beans for her-
>”Y-Yes. It’s true. I-I-I-I’m a girl,” she says suddenly

>The boys come to a sudden halt
>”You’re fucking with us,” Mike says, glancing between both her and you. “Actually, you’re both fucking with us. Stop that.”
>”I KNEW I SMELLED A FEMALE’S SCENT,” Jenna says, and the joy of being right gleams in her eyes — brighter than her polished fangs
>Instinct takes over, and Sam shrinks back away from the fangs and the claws, holding her bat out in front of her like an aluminum shield
>Jenna recoils quickly and mutters an apology
>”A-Anyway,” she continues, looking incredibly harmless as a bumblebee. “I thought I smelled something… strange. But I couldn’t figure out where it was coming from. This explains so much.”
>Alex looks dismayed
>”So wait, Sam, you’re really a girl?”
>Overwhelmed, Sam shoves her bandanna back over her face to hide her blush
>”Yes,” she says, behind the cloth. “I-I’m not lying-”
>”Wait, if you’re a girl…” He looks at you, and then back to Sam, steam practically pouring out of his ears
>Guess his mind is really cranking on putting these two facts together
>”If you’re a girl… And Anon is a boy… And you two…”
>You feel a steady knot of anxiety and embarrassment settle in on your chest
>It spreads quickly to your face
“Alex… Don’t…” you caution him
>…Okay, maybe there’s a little rage there too
>His mouth drops open, his smile almost as wide as his face
>”ANON ISN’T GAY!”
>Strangely enough, he looks to Mike for confirmation
>And that fuckass is smiling, nodding, as the realization slowly dawns on him with all the speed of a turtle and the grace of a rhino
>”Anon’s not gay,” Mike repeats, more to himself than to the rest of you

“I’ve been saying that from the very fucking start; I’m not gay, you goddamn idiots,” you counter, face pulsing red
>You almost hate that they care more about you being not-gay than they do about Sam’s true identity
>”Thumper, you’re really a chick? Like, pussy and everything?” Mike leans forward, smiling like a total shithead
>The bunny flinches backwards, and you know Mike’s just doing it to fuck with Sam, but you can’t help but internally cringe on her behalf
>You imagine her blush must be the same color as her bandanna
>”MIKE!” Jenna cries. “What the hell is wrong with you?”
>He spins around with a wounded look on his face
>God you really are glad Jenna can keep him under control
>Mike mutters an apology while Alex claps you on the shoulder
>”I’m seldom wrong,” he says, “but you played the long-con with me. Good work.”
>You smile at him — a warm smile that you hope communicates how fucking done you are with this whole joke
>He smiles back, and deep down, you still don’t think he understands
>”Hey,” Mike holds an open palm out to Alex. “You owe me 30 bucks.”
>Alex looks down at the pale palm, spider-webbed with blue veins, and then back up at Mike
>”You idiot,” he shakes his head slowly, a smile still warming his face. “You actually think I have any money?”
>”Nah,” Mike says, all too casually. “I just like knowing I was right.”
“Wait,” you turn to the vampire. “So you thought I was straight the whole time?”
>You still feel that warm pulse of shame and blood in your face
>”Nah, I thought you were bi. That’s why he only owes me 30 and not 60. You’re not bi, right?”
>You answer him with a raised middle finger, while Sam stares holes into the sidewalk

>Parties
>Why is it that parties are a staple of entertainment for high school (and college) students alike? What is so alluring about 50-70 hormonal teenagers stuffed into a house, drowning in noise and drink?
>Because they’re fun, damnit. And you need to experience this. And Sam does too
>It’ll be good for you 
>And that’s what you tell yourself as you pull up to Bradyon Smith’s house, which is in one of the ritziest neighborhoods you’ve ever seen
>Cars that cost more than your mortgage choke the gutters for three solid blocks, making your rust bucket stick out like a festering wound on a super model’s porcelain skin
>You cut the engine and stare into the dash, trying to find the courage to move 
>You lost it somewhere between your gas tank’s ‘E’ and red needle inching dangerously close to the pits
>Mike pops the door and spouts a sharp and immediate whistle
>Jenna and Sam instinctively look over at him, expectant
>Despite your anxiety, you can’t help but grin a little
>They’re so cute
>”These houses make me sick,” Alex groans as he unfurls his wiry body and stands tall in the cold night air
>”Everything you see here?” He gestures towards the rows of gated homes, their windows polished and shining with domestication, their exterior paint as fresh as their lawns are green. “All the fruits of oppression. This is what you get when you atomize, sodomize, and demoralize the gentle laborer.” He spits onto the pristine sidewalks for effect
“Don’t you live in a neighborhood like this?” You offer, stepping out of your rustbucket
>You know he’s got a three-car garage, a house twice the size of yours, and a modest trust fund
>He just dresses poorly and bikes everywhere for loosely understood ideological convictions
>Alex tips his fedora at you like you were the body pillow he finally convinced his mom to pay for
>“I’ve only infiltrated their ranks. How does a virus kill its host?” He pauses, eyes flashing between your collective faces
>Impatient, he turns to Sam
>”Sam? How does a virus kill someone?”
>”F-From the inside…?”
>”Precisely!” Alex explodes. “As they say in the Art of War, ‘know thy enemy.’” 
>He seems to have gotten to know his enemy’s deep pockets well enough
>You clear your throat
“Save it for the revolution, comrade. We s-still have a party to go to.”
>Your voice stumbles a bit, betraying your nerves, as if the tension now spreading across your body could manifest itself in clipped syllables
>You feel a delicate, fuzzy hand sneak its way into yours
>When you look down, Sam is starting deadhead, but you can still see the blush pressed into her downy fur
>Her hand starts trembling, and a reasonable guess would tell you she’s far more nervous about this than you are
>Her experiences with alcohol and drunk people until this point have not been… positive
>You give her hand a reassuring squeeze, as if to say ‘I’m here for you’
>But what you want to say is ‘We don’t have to go. I’m not sure I want to anymore.’
>The chance you had to back out goes pacing off down the street when Mike and Jenna, walking awfully close to one another, start making their way towards Braydon’s house
>Alex jogs off after them, one hand plastered to the top of his skull to keep his fedora in place
>He throws a quick glance over his shoulder —  back at you — before siding up with Mike
>… Shit

>Dressed in your priest vestments and standing off next to the keg itself, you feel your face burning, and not just from the alcohol
>This beer tastes like social anxiety
>Teenagers — entirely human in composition — mix and mingle with such grace that their sheer normalcy practically tips the last swallow of beer in your mouth when you see a girl in a skimpy ‘nerd’ outfit jam her tongue down Braydon’s throat
>You look down at Sam, who hasn’t taken a single sip of her beer
>She stares down at her feet, awkward and alone 
>”Hey,” you nudge her. ”You gonna drink any of that?”
>”Y-Y-Yeah,” she says
”Alright. But don’t let this color your opinion of beer — or parties. Both are shit.”
>You debate detaching from the wall and wandering back into the crowd
>Is there a redemption arc in your future?
>…Evidently, there is one in Alex’s future
>He sticks above the crowd like a well-dressed beanpole
>His hands fly and curve and cut through the air while a rapt (and drunk) audience looks on
>They hold their collective breaths while Alex clears his throat
>He looks like a proud hawk standing atop as his kill
>”All I’m trying to say is that we’re complacent in the slow rape of the environment. I’m just as guilty as you are, people.” 
>He crushes a red plastic cup in his iron(curtain) grip, spewing shards of plastic and cheap beer about the crowd
>And yet, nobody revolts against him
>In fact, someone hands him their own beer like a feeble adherent in the presence of their enlightened cult leader
>He takes a mighty gulp and hands it back
>”Thank you, comrade. These hands-” he holds them up to the crowd for effect. “These are the hands that will tie noose around my bosses’s neck. But not yet. Not until all of you are free from your own bondage. You there!”
>He throws an accusatory finger towards someone in the crowd dressed like a hotdog
>”You there, dressed like a hotdog! Where do you work?”
>”At a coffee shop,” the hotdog replies
>”Bah, your stimulant juice only fuels the proletariat. I promise, comrade, we will dismantle your prison brick by miserable brick.”
>Someone shouts back at Alex, but the pounding music obscures both the retort and Alex’s reply
>You can tell by the smug look on Alex’s face it’s about to get heated 
>This was a bad idea
>”D-D-Does Alex h-h-hate his job?” Sam asks
“Yes. And as a bonus, he hates everyone else’s job for them.”
>”I-I only w-w-work so I c-can come home late. I don-don’t think I li-like my job very much. St-Stella is-”
“Insane?”
>Sam nods, sloshing her beer in her cup. She takes a weak sip and makes a sour face in response
>You swap your empty cup for her half-full one
“Like I said, parties and beer — they’re both shit. Well, most beer isn’t so bad. I take back what I said earlier. But the stuff they’re serving here? It tastes like piss.” 
>Sam giggles
>”H-How do-do you kn-know what t-t-t-that ta-tastes like?”
“When did you get so cheeky?” You say, and you genuinely are trying to be lighthearted this time around
>Sam’s response comes almost automatically
>”S-Sorry I d-didn’t mean t-t-that.”
>Christ
>You’re far too inebriated to explain the nuances of your prior statement
>There’s so much there, your addled mind muses
>You are SUCH a BRILLIANT communicator, especially when you’re drinking
>You tug at the collar of your robes, degassing some hot air trapped in the folds as your conversation drifts into awkward territory
>The sheer amount of bodies in this lavish house turns the marble-white walls into a kiln
>You’re roasting in your costume, and you’re sure Sam, with the shag of her fur and thick hoodie, is melting even more than you are
>Plus anxiety often turns up the heat in a person
“Fuck this,” you say, peeling off the wall. “It’s hotter than Auschwitz’s kitchen in here.” 
>Sam sighs deeply, all the tension draining from her face
>”Y-Y-Yeah it is,” she says
“Can’t even believe it’s October. All the normie-”
>You catch yourself before you complete the phrase
>Christ, you’re starting to sound like Vanessa
>You cough
“I mean, all the people crammed in this room are making it hot as shit. C’mon, let’s go somewhere else.”
>You take take another swallow of beer, your head spinning already from the drink
>This lavish house, with its top-of-the-line electronics and marble white walls, is starting to make you sick
“Folllowww meeeee,” you say in a sing-song voice, pushing through a throng of people dressed offensively like cats
>They give Sam uneasy stares as she follows in your wake
>By this point the stares don’t bother you
>You’ll flaunt Sam all you want, and everyone who thinks you shouldn’t be seen with her can suck your entire dick

>Wherever Mike and Jenna went is none of your concern
>You’re ascending the stairs to try and carve out a little bit of space between yourself and everyone else
>Sam labors behind you
>You can see the sweat glistening on her furry brow, and you pause halfway up the spiraling staircase
>If you didn’t know better, this house could be used to shoot porn in
>It just has that vibe, you know?
>Maybe you’ve seen it somewhere
>Sam joins you at your side, and instead of carrying on further, you grasp for her hands
>She’s tiny, but she reaches up to meet your efforts
>You don’t even care who sees anymore
>You just want to help her, see her grow and change
>And it feels good to have her tiny, delicate frame up against you, and you’re starting to get an idea of as to why

>At the top of the stairs you finally get what you came for. A bit of silence
>The thrumming bass from the music downstairs is like a distant memory, echoing off cave walls and dissipating into senseless noise
>You take a look around, sucking in hot air
>God you’re still out of shape, and Sam is no better
>She rolls her sleeves up to her elbows and throws her hood back
“I feel you on that one, sister.” You roll the sleeves on your priest robes as best as you can
>She looks uncomfortable being called ‘sister’
>You squint hard in the half-light that cloaks the upstairs portion of the house
>It’s just an endless sea of doors, presumably leading to bedrooms or bathrooms
>Wait
>Don’t people come up here to hook up during parties?
>Oh god
>You almost consider going back downstairs, when, at the end of the hall, you see an open door
>Okay
>Good
>This is good
>The door sways and wavers a bit, as if pulled by some kind of invisible force
>To you, that means there’s an open window
>And more importantly: a cooling breeze

>You and Sam labor down the hallway, struggling under the weight of your costumes and the clothes you’re wearing beneath them
>Christ
>Just getting to the room is like running a full marathon
>When you stumble through the door and into the moonlit darkness of the bedroom, the cold air that kisses your sweaty face makes it all worth it
>You raise your head off the floor as Sam stands in the entryway, the moonlight outlining her baggy figure in an other-worldly glow
>Two wispy white curtains flank a wide-open window
>They stir like captured ghosts as another gust cuts into the room
>The room is bone white and clean, with a single king-size bed in the center and a nightstand to the right of it
>Must be a guest room
>Wait
>You look back towards the window
>It leads outside (duh) but it doesn’t terminate into a sheer drop
>Instead, the roof extends far outwards beneath the frame
>Which means you can…
“Hey, come with me. I want to try something.”

>That something involves you shimmying out of the open window onto the roof
>You crawl out of the frame and plant two palms on the gritty shingles
>You notice three things
>One: the air out here is free, but it feels like swallowing ice water with every breath you take
>Two: the rooftop shingles paint black streaks on your palms and the hem of your priest robes
>Three: Above your head, the moon hangs like a fattened guillotine, so close that you swear to god with a good-sized ladder you could reach up and tear a hunk off like it was cheap styrofoam
>This HAS to be fucking up the tides and the oceans
>Full moons for a whole week? Yeah, shit is fucked in coastal towns
>You stand up at full height on the rooftop, staring up at the bold moon
>It’s hard to believe a bunch of angsty teenagers with a magic book could have this much of an impact on an ancient celestial body
>And it’s even harder to believe that a communist, an anxious bunny, a coward, an asshole and one perfectly normal vixen are going to push it back into place tomorrow night
>You hear the sound of struggle and turn to see Sam crawling out of the window
>With the bone-white light of the moon draped across her like a thin sheet, she looks like a specter
>When she looks up at you, sweat kissing her brow, she tries to smile, but the exhaustion is plain enough to turn her smile into a strained frown
“Careful now.” You crouch down on instinct. “One good tumble and you’re going over the edge.”
>She squeaks and freezes up halfway out of the window
>Good going Anonymous
>You scared her
“That’s just like, the worst case scenario. Let me put it like this,”
>You release your grasp on her and lock eyes
>You love the way her eyes shine like gold nuggets hit with flashlights in the dark
>You love the way they’re so full, like they could hold all of her troubles and pain in there, and blink them away
>You love the way she lives life as an art form
>You love he-
>”Y-Yes?” Sam says. “W-What w-were you g-g-going to s-s-say?”
>You must have been staring for too long, lost in the hurricane of your thoughts
“I meant to say: I may be drunk, but I promise, I won’t let you fall.”
>You extend a hand to her
>With a slight hesitation, she takes it
>Her palms are slick with sweat, and trembling from exhaustion yet you interlock your fingers all the same
>With a determined force, you pull Sam through the window
>And once again, you don’t know your own strength, or how weak Sam is, because she flings towards you with less-than-acrobatic grace
>Thankfully, you planted your feet deep into the shingles, so instead of knocking you down like a holy bowling pin, you steady her against you, like a storm in a tree
>Which isn’t all that hard, actually
>Her body is soft and small against your own, lithe and feminine
>You wrap your arms around the back of her neck and pull her tight to keep both of you from rocking backwards and taking an involuntary swan dive into a backyard without a pool
>It feels like you might break her if you squeeze too tight, but you can’t help it
>Instead, she returns your gesture, wrapping her arms around your waist to ‘steady herself’
>She cinches her body tight against yours
>And for a moment, in complete stasis, you two stand atop that rooftop, locked together like two pieces of a puzzle
>You can feel her heart hammering against your chest, the heat of her body radiating off her, the catch of air leaving her chest when she sighs into you
>She stands on her toes and looks up into your eyes
>And her smile is bigger than the moon
>”T-Thanks for c-c-catching me,” she says, color high in her cheeks
>You instinctively look away, hiding your relief and the embarrassment now pressing color into your nervous body
“I told you I wouldn’t let you fall.”

>From the corner of your eyes, you can still see her looking up into your face, finding serenity in your soft features and boyishness
>You settle on her thin, pinkish lips
>Magnets aren’t even attracted to each other this much
>You almost lean in and-
>Something catches your eye
>Something at the apex of the roof
>Two lone figures, silhouetted against the moon like two figures on a canvas
>One of them has a tail that’s fanning back and forth and a pair of sharp ears perked high into the air
>The silhouette couldn’t be more obvious to you
>Jenna
>And
>The person next to her must be Mike and
>Oh my god
>Your heart leaps into your throat as you see Jenna’s shadowy figure lean into Mike, her predatory face pressed against his

>”S-Something w-w-wrong?” Sam asks, still buried in your chest
“N-No, nothing’s wrong. In fact…”
>The world is just spinning a little too fast
>Or that’s the beer
>”Y-Your he-heart is beating r-really fast,” Sam coos. “I can h-hear it like a d-d-drum.”
>A cruel idea springs to mind
>You figure you owe Mike this for pummeling the shit out of you on Tuesday
>And really, just in general, for being a calloused ass
“Things are about to get better. Follow me, and be as quiet as you can,” you say, disengaging from Sam, much to the bunny’s disappointment

>You crouch low and try to distribute your weight as evenly as you can
>You even spread your arms to keep balance as you climb up the slope of the rooftop towards its shingled summit, where the lone figures of Mike and Jenna now sit, awash in the revealing light of the moon
>Sam is much better at this than you are
>She must have more experience being stealthy, because she manages to pass you on your way up
>She casts an expectant look over her shoulder
>Mike and Jenna don’t seem to be paying attention to anything except each other
>And to each other’s tongues
>And right when they break apart, staring romantically into one another, you announce your presence with crescendo of claps and whistling
>Jenna and Mike both jump almost a solid foot into the air, putting Sam’s jet-pack reflexes to shame
>You crawl up behind them both
“God, you two are precious, you know that? Just absolutely precious.”
>The vixen’s blush is so bright you swear you can her cheeks glowing in the dark
>And…
>Oh that’s just beautiful
>Mike throws his head to the side in a pout
>But really, it’s so you can’t see that he’s also blushing like a school girl
>”I don’t suppose it’s too cliche to say ‘this isn’t what it looks like?’” Jenna whispers
>Your smile widens as you and Sam scoot up next to them and plop down on the roof
>Happy now?
“Far too late, my dear. And you-” you level an accusatory finger at Mike “-Do you have protection?”
>Jenna pales
>”P-Protection?” She stammers, shrinking into her bumblebee costume
>”Anon, shut the fuck upppp.” Mike buries his face into his palms
“I’m serious. I know you don’t pay attention in Biology with Mr. Bolm, but you still have the right to bear your third arm — for now.”
>”His WHAT?” Jenna shrieks
>”Anon, don’t answer that,” Mike commands you
>Well, you’ve had your fun
“Awww you crazy kids.” Your tone is mocking. “I’m just teasing.”
>”I’m older than you are, you assfucker,” Mike hisses, turning his focus back onto the moon
>Anything to distract from the fact that his face is burning red, made all the more obvious by the fact that he’s hopelessly pale now
>Whatever happened to not liking anthro women?
>Quietly, Sam whispers in your ear: “D-Do humans h-have t-t-three arms somewhere?”
>You slap your palm over your mouth
>It’s all you can do to keep down the laughter
>Sam looks towards Jenna for guidance. The fox — still helplessly crammed between you and Mike — mouths something at the bunny
>And now you’re the only one not wearing hot scarlet across your face, as the realization strikes Sam with the expediency of an iceberg

>The world seems to fall silent, save for the distant thrum of bass from the house, or the shrieks and shouts of drunken teenagers spilling (or stumbling) out into the backyard
>The moon looks so swollen in the sky, hanging above Ranchview as if dangling on a single, translucent thread
>A chill gust sweeps past you
>You tighten your arms around your body, shivering
>Mike and Jenna don’t seem too bothered — Mike’s jacket should keep him plenty warm, and you’re sure Jenna’s bumblebee costume is padded
>How you wish your were a bumblebee and not a knock-off priest
>You feel a bright spot of heat nuzzle up into your side
>Sam presses herself up against you
>Your eyes meet for a quick second like flint and steel striking each other
>And you’re about to say something
>But then you turn your focus onto something behind you
>Grunting
>Noise
>Struggle
>A dark shadow crawls up the rooftop
>In your addled state you almost scream and hurl yourself forward, off the roof, in a bid to escape
>You tense up, ready to explode forward and take that promised swan dive
>A cloud rolls past the moon, releasing a flood of white light that strikes the dark figure like a spotlight from God
>Oh
>It’s Alex, and his arms are loaded with beers
>You spin the rest of your body to face him
“Yooooo!” You call out
>”What is up comrades?” He says with a hoarse grunt. “Thought I’d come join my co-conspirators on this monument to man’s misery.”
>He plants himself next to Sam and starts unloading beers from his arms, passing them down the line
>Sam takes one and examines it, as if unsure of what it is
>You pluck one and twist the lid, releasing a sharp hiss of pressure. It’ll be shitty beer, and you’re already cold and slightly drunk, but moments like these feel right for a brew
>Jenna cautiously takes hers and sniffs at it, grimacing at the sharp scent of hops
>”So,” Mike says, sitting back on his palm and throwing back his beer. “What brings the great Alexi up to our humble perch?”
>Alexi sucks down on his drink and issues a triumphant belch
>”My work is seldom appreciated by those who don’t understand it,” he says, as if you’re supposed to know what that means without context
>His voice is ragged and strained
>He must have been shouting for a good while after you and Sam dipped
>”I got them too riled up. I swear, they’re about to riot down there,” he continues. “I’d approve, of course, but I didn’t want to be the center of it. Buncha rabid animals.”
>You cringe at the utterance of the ‘r’ word, but Sam and Jenna don’t seem to care all that much
>”Good work comrade,” Mike says. He sets his empty beer down tenuously on the slope of the roof and leans his head on Jenna’s shoulder. “Sew the seeds of the revolution.”
>He sounds a million miles away
>Distant, yet happy
>The vixen’s head snaps left, then right, down the line of people, her face puffed up and red
>When you lock eyes, you see the request for permission in them
>You shrug in indifference
>She knocks the lid off the beer, and with eyes scrunched tight, brings it to her dark lips
>You don’t care what they do or what they drink
>You’re too at peace to care
>Around you the world seems to erupt in hormonal chaos and drunken debauchery
>Social worlds you’ll never be a part of
>Things you’ll never do
>But you like it better up here with your friends
>You feel like a tiny raft adrift on a very large and unfamiliar ocean, and everyone of you is a torch against the darkness
>You’ll happily burn for them, together, like one big bonfire
>Or five logs leaning against one another in a blaze
“Ever thought that this is what you’d be doing your senior year of high school? Fighting the forces of evil for a bunch of people who don’t even know you exist?” You wonder aloud
>”Them down there?” Jenna points a finger forward the knot of costumes moving around the backyard. “They know we exist. I think.”
“They know, but they don’t care.”
>”Gahhh don’t get all emo on us, Anon,” Mike says. “You keep talking like that you’re going to start siding with the goths.”
“Bah, never. I’m not that much of a titanic idiot. Besides, I DO care about those kids down there. But I care more about the people up here on this roof. That’s why I’m doing this. And because I’m sick of being a coward, watching from the sidelines, running away from what scares me, hurting who I care about in the process.”
>Your mind flashes back to Mr. Bolm and Gloria, both casualties of your cowardice
>And then there was Sam
>The way you treated her for so long makes you physically cringe
>You hope, in some way, you’re setting things right
>And not just with her, but with yourself too
>Your heavy eyes flick down to her slight, pink lips, curled up in a shy smile
>”Awwww we care about you too,” Jenna adds, her voice flush with joy and the beginnings of inebriation
>Is this her first time drinking?
>”You know what I care about?” Alex says. “Changing things for someone somewhere. I wanna do something that matters. That’s why I fight against oppression in whatever form it takes. Be it at The Shop N’ Save, school, or even at this gathering-”
>”It’s called a party,” Mike cuts in. “Just call it a party. And I don’t seem to recall you running for any sort of student office… ever. How exactly do you fight oppression?”
>”My existence is resistance,” is Alex’s retort
>”I’m with you on doing something that matters, but that was a lame excuse and you know it.”
>The communist crusader shrugs and pulls back on his beer again
>When all reasoning and logic fails: beer
>Beer is a universal language
>It’s clear that this isn’t the time or place to discuss thin-
>”I-I wan-want to do something th-that matters t-too,” Sam squeaks up.
>She drops into a whisper. “I w-w-want to f-f-finally b-be brave.”
>You’re a little shocked that she’s actually talking on her own behalf for once, but then, registering her words, you start to nod
>Doing something that matters
>Being brave
>Now those are ideas worth dying for
>There’s something to rally behind, whatever ‘something that matters’ is
>How do you quantify it? How do you define what matters?
>…Does it matter?
>Maybe you can channel the pervasive energy of an idea or a goal, however nebulous it may be, and achieve something immeasurable?
>As if all the great forces of evil and old and adult age were the clear sky, and you, your little group of friends, were the hurricane that would go nameless and uncategorized
>You want to do something that matters
>You want to stomach everything and keep it down — all the terror, the fear, the anxiety, the shame, the regret, the pain
>All for something — and someone — that matters
>You want to be brave, like Sam, who has already endured so much pain and hardship, who grows by leaps and bounds and strides every chance she gets
>And that’s when you made your decision, settling your eyes again on her lips

>Two things were happening in that moment:
>Mike, Jenna and Alex were staring at you, shocked, their faces practically glowing in the pale moonlight
>And you were — consciously or unconsciously — wrapping your arm around Sam’s slender waist, while her words pounded into your skull, in-step with your wild, hammering heart
>’Be brave’
>She looks up at you, startled, at first, but she doesn’t draw back when you bend your neck and lean forward
>’Be brave’
>Her eyes flutter shut before yours do
>She leans up, towards you, drawing on the unconscious muscle memory that teaches birds to fly and fish to swim, to draw her arms around your neck and pull you close
>’Be brave’

>Your lips meet hers

>Every heartbeat you spend there feels like it could drag on for eternity
>With delicacy, you press your lips together
>Her fur tickles the tops of your lips
>You taste the sweat, the salt, feel the palpability of her slender mouth tight against yours
>Before you even realize what’s happening, Sam tightens her arm against the back of your neck, further pressing you two together, breaking the parallel distance that separates you from her
>It feels…
>…Like heaven in her arms
>Like wetness and fur, like comfort and grace
>And you start to tremble at the weight of everything crashing down on you all at once — the kiss, the alcohol, the night sky, your friends — but to Sam, that’s all a galactic mile away
>There’s only you and her: doing something that matters

>When at last you pull back from each other (you still shaking; hot air and steam dumping from your mouth), there’s silence
>Sam quickly pivots her body to face away from you, but you can see the unbridled joy played out across her face
>Her ears stand on high alert, and her little poofy tail is fanning as fast and as violently as a stubby tail can fan
>You wipe your lip with the back of your hand, still tasting her on your tongue
>That was your… well it was your fir-
>”BRO JOB BRO JOB BRO JOB!” Mike howls into the sky, clapping his hands like a madman. He pulls on an imaginary train whistle. “CHOO CHOO!”
>He stands up, wobbling on two shaky legs. “Hey, everyone!” His voice booms. “Anonymous isn’t gay!”
>”Mike get down! If you fall off this roof I swear to God…” Jenna hisses
>Paying her no mind in his addled state, he cups his hands around his mouth for volume and belts out: “SAM GARLEN IS A-”
>Jenna yanks him down by the bottom of his jacket
>He lands hard on his ass, grunting as the roof practically sodomizes him
>”Ow,” Mike groans, sliding down onto the slope of the roof
>You scowl at him, still flush, head spinning from the kiss
>But you can’t say you don’t deserve it a bit
>The whole thing is stupid and silly and sappy
>”Hey,” Mike looks up at Jenna. “Thanks for that. I think I had a little too much.”
>”Oh, you think?” She replies curtly, her own beer half empty
>When they start talking you disengage and focus back on Sam
>Sam turns to face you, and her expression gives you pause
>She has tears in her eyes, though she’s doing her best to smile
>The rabbit scrubs her eyes with the back of her hands
>”T-Thank you f-for tonight.” She pauses, as if she’d forgotten what she was going to say. “A-And for e-everything. W-Without you I-I don’t think I-I’d have m-made it t-this far. Y-You saved m-me.”
“Nonsense,” you say. “Samurai Outlaw saved herself. And I mean that. All I did was provide some of the grunt work.”
>”…I-I d-don’t k-know ab-about that… I-I’m n-not a h-hero. I just d-d-dress l-like one.”
>Fuck
>What is it going to take for her to believe that she has some worth?
>You turn to face the moon again as all five of you lapse into a momentary silence

>”Can you believe it?” Alex cuts the quiet like an ice-breaking ship cleaves into the frozen Arctic. “Tomorrow is… the day.” 
>He’s not looking at anyone
>His eyes fill with moonlight
>”Gonna go to that party and knock some skulls,” Mike says, sitting up, grabbing another brew and then leaning hard into Jenna
>Unsure of what to do with her own hands, she hover-hands over Mike’s waist
>And it’s frankly fucking adorable how awkward she is around him
>”Y-Y-You thi-think we ha-have a shot?” Sam asks
“’Course we do. The goths are a lot dumber than they appear. We’re going to go to that dance tomorrow, kick some ass, and then…” you drag in a deep breath of cold air
>”I’m going to go to college.” Mike says before you can finish. “I don’t care what I need to do to lift this curse. I’m going to fuck some shit up and then go to college — put this all behind me.”
>You feel your throat tighten
>It must be just the cold, right?
>He’s not going to… leave you all behind though, is he?
>Like, intellectually, you know he’s leaving, but emotionally, you guess it really hasn’t hit you yet that everyone is going their separate ways
>”Me too,” Alex joins in. “I can’t think of anything more important. Or anything I’d rather be doing with my Halloween.” He flashes his polished smile at you all
>Your heart jumps a bit
>”You’re going to school?” Jenna says, looking at Alex like he just said he was pregnant
>”’Course I am,” he replies in a slurred voice, deep into another beer. “I’m going to be a politician and FIGHT for the rights of the people.”
>Your hands start to sweat a bit
>College
>Everyone leaving
>Ambitions
>Plans
>Goals
>What do you have?
>A wild, vague notion, one that scares the shit out of you:
>The idea of leaving too
>You glance down at your beer, see it’s half-empty, and knock it back for courage
“I’m going to graduate,” you blurt out, probably a lot louder than you had intended
>You feel that familiar knot of anxiety start to coil up in your chest like a cobra
“A-And I’ve decided: I’m going to college.”
>Stunned silence except for the rhythmic pounding of a subwoofer
>Someone at the party squeals with laughter
>”Good,” Mike says, matter-of-fact. “Of all the people I know, you’re the most qualified to go to school.”
>”I’ll drink to that.” Alex hoists his bottle in the air like an amber torch
>You weakly lift yours
>Jenna lifts her (second) bottle with Mike
>”A-A-And I’m n-n-never go-going back to my dad!” Sam exclaims, thrusting her half-finished beer into the air
>What do you say?
>Something cool?
>Something deep?
>Maybe just anything
>Spinning around in your head, thoughts firing off in all different directions, you can only settle on one thing:
“Here’s to something that matters.”

>”It’s easy, Sam. Even I’ve driven a car,” Alex slurs from the passenger seat. “It’s like… like riding a bike.”
>”I-I’ve n-never r-ridden a b-”
>Alex groans
>”What else haven’t you done, breathed air?”
>You shoot him a defensive look
>Sam sits perched on your lap, her slender fingers gripping the wheel. Your foot rests on the brakes
>Your car, the rustbucket, is humming steadily, crammed in between Mercedes and BMWs
>Like a pimple on a perfect face
“Listen, you’re going to do just fine,” you assure her. “Just take us ba-back to the old church.”
>You can still taste the last beers on your tongue, and the sloshing in your stomach makes you wish you hadn’t been so zealous tonight
“I work the pedals, you steer. There’s nothing to it.”
>”I-I don’t k-know…” she starts, but Mike cuts in from the backseat, his words even sloppier than Alex’s
>”Yours is the only one thats sober,” he says
>”Hey, I’m sober enough,” Jenna whines. She’s laying horizontal in the backseat, her head in the crook of Mike’s lap. Mike runs a gentle finger through the fur on her skull, causing her ears to fold back
>”You kidding? I wouldn’ts trust you to even rides a scooter right now,” Mike leans his head back against the seat and closes his eyes. “You and me got a good set up back here anyway.”
>”Normally I’d claw you for that.” Jenna nuzzles into Mike’s lap. “But this time you’re right.”
>”On which part?”
>She replies: “Quit while you’re ahead.”
>Which Mike does, the crowned champion of the evening
>Or, at least of the back seat
>You have Sam
>And that’s enough
>As if to remind your inebriated self of this fact, you wrap your arms around her waist and lightly pull her against you
>She squeaks a little, but her typical tremors never come
>Even at her boniest, most emaciated, you don’t care about having her weight on top of you
>You just need to feel the weight of a single person to anchor you back to earth
“Ready?” You whisper to her
>She nods and grips the wheel a little tighter
>You throw the car into reverse and give a little gas
>Sam angles the wheel to compensate…
>… And your car goes the wrong direction, scraping into the curb with a painful shriek
>Her body tenses up
“Don’t worry, don’t worry,” you say in as soothing a tone as you can muster, but your tongue trips over your words and you just end up doing a lot of drawn out syllables
“Just angle the wheel the other way when you’re going in reverse.” 
>She pulls the wheel over and you give it some gas
>The car comes free
>You throw the transmission into drive and give the accelerator a little gas
>You pull away into the night, leaving the pounding bass and debauchery of the party behind you in a swirling trail of loose leaves

>Sam is surprisingly good at navigating her way around town, and her steering motions — while labored and cautious — get you out of the the ritziest part of town
>She hardly even needed you to navigate the main roads
>Her memory is impressive, to say the least
>It’s probably what helps her draw so gracefully
>The night is slow and cold, the radio low, but the car is a warm little torch carving down the empty roads
>And it feels good to have Sam’s delicate body resting up against yours
>She feels like she’s made of glass sometimes
>But then you remember her running away from her dad, opening up to you, defying Stella, going through ALL the shit that she’s been through in her life
>And you know she’s made of sterner stuff than what her bones and mottled fur say about her

>For how boring and shitty the party was, the rest of the night turned out to be perfect
>Until you got to the church

>You should have sensed something was wrong as you piled out of the car
>You should have been more alert, but the beer had blunted your already blunt senses
>How could you have not seen it there, just in the moon-cast shadow of that tree?
>Sam and Jenna sensed it too, but neither of them seemed to be able to place their sudden, hair-raising anxiety
>It was just that gut-kicking, involuntary sense that something was here that did not belong
>The two exchanged worried glances the second they got out of the car, Sam’s ears high and alert, Jenna’s mouth opening up in a snarl
>You ever have a moment, right before something goes horribly wrong, where everything happens in slow motion?
>This was one of those moments
>You saw Alex adjust his fedora and straighten his suit jacket out, brushing off dust and grit from Braydon’s roof
>You saw Mike smile at Alex, his mouth shaping silent words as he pulled his jacket around him
>Sam looks towards you, her face is shock and horror, her body weak lines and frailty collapsing into her clothes like a failing bridge into troubled waters
>She opens her mouth to say something
>But
>Everything went quiet

>And then a light shineth into the darkness, spraying your shadows up against the front entrance of the church
>Two lights
>Old headlights
>From an old sedan, wearing belts of rust and cracks on its windshield, as if it shared blood with your own rustbucket
>An old and shitty Sedan that Mike had seen before in the neighborhoods on Tuesday
>The old and shitty Sedan that you saw in the school lot, that followed you here last night and left without suspicion
>The old and shitty Sedan that Sam’s Dad is climbing out of
>The silver of a worn pistol flashes in the headlights

>And there he stands, alone in the headlights, tall, cut out of jagged angles, his mouth set in a hard, determined line, amber eyes fixed on Sam
>His body stirs and sways with restlessness and the tell-tale signs of inebriation
>Jenna gasps and takes a small step backwards, her ears folding submissively against her skull
>Sam remains frozen, eyes shot wide with something beyond just plain fear
>”Who the fuck are you?” Mike says, taking a step forward
>Sam’s Dad calmly raises his gun and aims it square into Mike’s chest
>Mike retreats a step backwards, and you can see his knuckles whiten with tension
>”All of you,” Sam’s dad says, his eyes sweeping the assembled group. “Just stay where you are.”
>He moves closer, heavy work boots crunching the shards of glass and gravel into the cold blacktop
>Up this close it’s easy to tell just how drunk he is
>His body moves in an almost serpentine pattern, but his bloodshot eyes remain fixed and hard
>Staring right at Sam
>”D-Dad?” Sam sputters as all the color leaves her cheeks in a single moment
>”Shut the fuck up,” he simmers. “You don’t get to call me that. Not ever. Bet you thought you were really brave, or clever, running away like that?”
>You can see the tears glassing Sam’s eyes as she starts to tremble all over
>”I-I’m s-s-s-s-sorry,” she says, though her apology is poorly received
>Her Dad’s face twists up into an enraged scowl
>”I know you are, you little twerp. You’re always sorry for everything all the time. But you ain’t sorry enough, not yet you’re not.”
>Your heart takes a leap into your stomach
>Christ, whenever someone says ‘not yet you’re not’ it never means anything remotely good
>Especially not now
>Sam’s hands fly to her ears, but she doesn’t even have the strength right now to properly grip them
>She just strokes them like a child strokes a toy when they’re nervous or scared
>”That’s right, squeeze your ears. It ain’t gonna do you no good,” he says, whiskey-rot pouring from his gullet
>You desperately want to snake a hand out and hold onto Sam
>Instead your eyes flick towards Sam’s dad
>Maybe it’s not too late for diplomacy?
>At the very least, you might be able to distract him long enough
>Your body goes numb, but you will your mouth to open and your tongue to work
>It’s the rudder that steers your small ship into a dangerous hurricane
>You summon a fortifying breath
>Full sails ahead
”It was my idea to rescue her,” you say. You meet her Dad’s gaze
>You see nothing but cold hatred
>”I know it was your idea. You think this stupid cunt could ever work up the guts to do what he did on his own? You don’t know how spineless he really is.” He motions towards Sam
>Alright, fuck diplomacy
>Diplomacy is the last resort of the weak
>You feel the anger rising in you like a stoked fire, smoldering in the center of your chest
>It burns and races outwards, singing through your nerves and veins like brushfire
“She’s stronger than you think she is. Way stronger than you’ll ever be.”
>Her Dad’s stare pierces you like a crossbow bolt straight to the chest
>”A-A-Anon, p-p-please,” Sam pleads with you. “D-Don’t say a-a-anything.”
>You breathe hard
>Your courage ebbs and flows like a weak tide
>It takes the stars
>And the light of an unnatural moon
>To whip yourself up into a tsunami
>Two forces — courage and cowardice — rage inside of you
“What’s with the bottle? Couldn’t face a bunch of teenagers without a little liquid courage, could you?”
>With that, you know which of the forces is winning
“And that gun. What are you doing with that? You can call Sam spineless all you want, but you’re the one hiding behind that soulless piece of shit.”
>Those old devil eyes of his narrow as he draws forth something from his addled memories. 
>“I remember you,” he says, rather calmly 
>He takes a massive step forward, his rabbit legs carry him with uneasy grace
>Your whole body tenses up
>You might be able to grab the gun
>It’s within arms reach
>Sam’s Dad is so close now
>Your heart hammers against your ribcage like a war drum
>Your arm starts trembl-
>There’s an explosion of blood in your mouth as the butt of the gun crushes the side of your face
>You stumble and nearly fall flat on your stomach, but catch yourself on the pavement, palms pressed into the cold grit
>Pain throbs behind your eyes like the ringing of a dull and distant bell
>You taste the salt and iron of the blood filling your mouth
>You spit a gob of the acrid fluid onto the blacktop, feeling too dazed to move
>”A-Anon!” Sam squeals
>And yet, she’s still stationary, pulling at her ears
>Only her worried eyes offer any kind of help
>The coward
>”That’s for running me down with your car like some kind of gutless bitch,” her Dad growls, his voice rugged and sharp
>The sound of the hammer snapping back on the gun freezes you in place
>”I came here tonight to put an end to this rotten bloodline,” he says, leveling the gun at the side of your head. “You ain’t no man, but you sure talk like one.” 
>Jenna and Alex gasp
>You remain frozen on the ground
>There’s a hitch in his chest as his breathing quickens
>”What’s a few bodies more?”

>Your eyes slam shut
>So, this is how it ends? Your brains needlessly splattered on some forgotten strip of blacktop?
>All 18 years of a life surmised and put to an end with one errant twitch of a mad rabbit’s fingers
>To whatever god is out there, you hope they take you into their pearly gates or walled gardens or whatever for trying to stand up for someone weaker than you
>Maybe you’ll be reincarnated?
>Somewhere, fast approaching on tracks of milled steel, pressing little earthquakes into the ground, a train sings into the night
>”S-Stop!” Sam commands
>You can hear her dad’s breathing slow, the tension in his chest trickling out with a drunken wheeze
>Your eyes flick open and you turn your head to look up
>Sam’s shape blocks your view of her Dad
>And might have blocked the bullet that would have entered your skull and torn a comet’s tail through your dreams, memories and personality
>”L-Leave th-them a-alone. I’m the o-one you want,” she says. “I-I kn-know why yo-you’re h-h-here. T-T-T-To take me back h-h-home.”
>She summons a deep breath from the small well of her courage
>”I-I’ll g-g-g-go h-h-home with you if you p-promise to l-l-leave them a-a-alone.”
>Her voice is steadied and measured, and were it not for her stutter, you might have even thought she was…
>…Brave
>Silence rings louder than a gunshot, except for the distant train whistle that’ll soon be passing down the tracks by the church
>You rise to your feet slowly, just in time to see her Father’s face twist up with horrible, rib-sucking laughter
>”You think I’m taking you home? Boy, you’re not going home tonight.”
>Sam forces herself to maintain eye contact with her father
>”I-I’m a g-girl, d-d-dad. I’m n-not Jacob. I-I can’t rep-replace your s-s-son.”
>His laughter stops almost as quick as it started
>”Don’t you think I don’t know that?” His voice is a cold whisper that rises into a shout. “YOU CAN’T REPLACE MY SON, BUT YOU SURE AS HELL CAN PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID TO HIM.”
>The train howls again, growing closer, and that devil smirk spreads across his face
>”Perfect timing,” he says, sweeping the gun around the group
>You swear that grim, devil smirk is going to be seared into your brain for the rest of your life
>“Everyone, down to the tracks,” he says

>You are Samantha Garlen, 18-years-old, a brown Mini-Rex rabbit dressed in your brother’s baggy hoodie and jeans, with a baseball bat strapped to your back, pretending to be a super hero of your own creation called Samurai Outlaw
>Samurai Outlaw is tough
>Samurai Outlaw is a loose cannon who plays for the good guys, but by his own rules
>Samurai Outlaw is collected and at ease among criminals, being one herself
>That is, of course, the character Samurai Outlaw
>You are Samantha ‘Sam’ Garlen
>And tonight, you die

>You feel the muzzle of your father’s old pistol pressed into your back as he marches you down the hill behind the old white oak door church
>Towards the set of railroad ties
>Your friends huddle together at the top of the hill, helplessly watching as you’re marched to your death
>They could call the police, but they’d never get here in time
>They could try rushing your dad
>But they’d end up getting shot
>”There’s gonna be an accident tonight,” your dad whispers. His breath is hot and salty in your sensitive ears, sending shivers up your spine
>You know the spine-crawling feeling well
>“Going to put an end to you, boy.”
>The train whistle sounds off again, and your dad starts laughing as the shakes hit you
>”You hear that? That train? I bet you wish you were dead right now, you coward little kid.”
>”SAM!” Anon shouts. “DON’T LET HIM DO THIS!”
>You’re almost to the tracks now, the gun firmly in the small of your back
>You try to keep a steady voice. “I-I-It’s okay,” you call up to Anon. “I-I’ll be okay.”
>Your gut sinks with each word
>Dad doesn’t seem to hear you
>Or if he does, he doesn’t care
>That train is so close now
>So loud and clear
>Gliding down the tracks, snaking around corners and bends, pulling its innocuous cargo down the ties
>The apprehension and waiting for death is the worst, part, you think
>Death can’t be that bad
>It’s everything leading up to it that makes your whole body shake violently
>You lift your heavy feet as you cross over onto the tracks
>Dad stands you upright
>”Remember these tracks? This is where I lost my son. That’s right. These fucking rails, down at the pits where you faggots would go play.” Dad draws out the word ‘faggots.’ “These rails got blood on ‘em. And it ain’t the old rail car yard, but this’ll do nicely. You’re going to pay back your debt tonight. Blood for blood.”
>You feel like puking again
>Dad towers over you, ignoring the baseball bat pressed against your back
>You stare dead ahead, eyes wide
“I-I remember J-J-Jacob t-t-too,” you say. “I-I-I re-remember h-h-how he l-looked out f-f-for me, a-and how much-”
>What you say doesn’t matter anymore
>You’re just speaking to the empty void at this point
“-How much l-like y-you he w-was. B-But he was b-better than y-y-you.”
>Dad digs the gun a little deeper into your back
>”I know why you remember him like that — you were always hidin’ behind him when trouble came ‘round. You always ‘been a burden to everyone.”
>He leans in real close to your ears, ignoring the bat strapped to your back
>”I bet he hated you.”
>You go stiff all over
“T-That’s not true…” you say
>What if he did hate you?
>You always held onto the idea that he had mixed emotions and feelings towards you
>But it wasn’t outright disdain and hate
>You were a coward weakling, but were you really worthy of his hate?
>Your thoughts blur and coalesce together as the train whistle blows again
>It’s so close now
>”Of course it’s true. He HATED you.” The way Dad says ‘hated’ is sharp enough to cut your throat. “We all hated you. All you’ve ever been is a coward and a burden.”
>You struggle against him
>”A drain on everyone. You ate our food and slept under our roof. But you ain’t even a guest. Just a liability. And you ain’t got nobody. Not even family.”
>He roots in you place with a rough hand that digs into your fur
“N-No, I h-ha-have f-f-friends now-”
>”THEM?” Dad jerks his head towards the top of the hill, where Anonymous, Mike, Jenna and Alex watch — helpless
>”They’re not your friends. They probably hate you too.”
“They do-don’t!” You cry in your strongest voice. “T-They c-c-care about me!”
>Tears spring to your eyes
>You wish you could stop your throat from tightening
>Where is your composure?
>Do you really want to die like a crying, sissy bitch?
>”They don’t like you. They feel /bad/ for you. You’re damaged goods anyway. Not my son, not my daughter, not anyone’s friend. Just my burden. That’s all you are.” 
>…
>He’s right, isn’t he?
>They don’t like you at all
>In fact, they’ve never liked you
>All those moments of cold callousness, avoiding you, ignoring you, all the whispered jokes and idle hatred
>The way they treated you
>The names they called you
>Always looking after you like you were some kind of…
>… Burden
>Even Anon didn’t like you
>Especially at first
>But… He saved you from this life
>He looked out for you
>He put his lips on yours and kissed you like he meant it
>From the rotten crevices of your brain — where all the abuse lives — comes a voice, one that’s not entirely your own
>’People don’t change.’ 
>’He’ll take what he wants from you, and then leave.’
>A cold wind rushes past you, and all you can do is gawk into the darkness, staring at that bend like the condemned stares down the gallows
>Soon death would come charging around that corner
>Unless…
“I-I’ll go h-h-home w-w-with you… I’ll n-never ta-talk to anyone ag-agin. I’ll d-d-do wh-whatever you wa-want. J-Ju-Just let go-” your pleading voice is swallowed up by another, closer train whistle
>Dad braces his broad back against the wind
>”Don’t you get it? You’re not going home. And you’re not dodging this train — not that you could in the first place. I told you: I’m going to put an end to this bloodline. Right here. On these tracks.”
>Your body goes cold, and then slackens into his rough grip, like you were throwing yourself into a big bed that you’d never climb out of
>So that’s how it’s gonna be?
>You feel his own hold on you loosen as he steps back
>And then
>The hollowed tip of the gun at the back of your head
>”Now get down on your knees,” he commands. “Right here, on these tracks. Where you robbed me.”
>You obediently drop to your knees
>”You miss your brother?” He says. You can tell by the strain in his voice — he does too
>”You’ll see him again soon.”
>The train tears around the bend, its forward-facing lights throwing yours and Dad’s shadows down the strip of tracks
>The conductor rips on the horn
>And everything goes quiet
>The familiar squeal of the brakes
>The train as it rolls down the ties
>The blast of the horn
>Even the blustering wind
>All gone
>And soon, you will be too
>It ends how it began, you guess
>Unwanted

>”WHAT WOULD SAMURAI OUTLAW DO!?”
>Like a brick through a window, Anon’s voice reaches your ears, scattering shards of quiet all over your addled mind
>Things register in your blunted senses:
>The train barreling down the tracks
>The wind
>Your father’s momentary distraction
>And Anon
>His voice so scared for you, so desperate, scarring his own throat so that he can be heard against the roar of the train and the cut of the wind

>What would Samurai Outlaw do?

>Samurai Outlaw would rise to her feet despite the wind blasting back her hood, her piercing amber eyes fixed dead ahead, catching the glow like a bowl
>Samurai outlaw pours light on everything
>Samurai Outlaw would — quick as a whip — spin to face her nemesis, drawing her signature baseball bat as she moves
>In one single motion, she’d swing her bat 
>And she’d swing with years of pent up rage, with the rawness of life singing through her adrenaline-clogged veins
>She’d swing as if her very life depended on it, as if her bat could rip galaxies apart and separate light from dark
>She’d swing like she was blasting through a thrown beer bottle out in front of a church, surrounded by friends
>That swing would connect with hurricane force against her foe’s hand, knocking the pistol from his grip
>There’d be tremendous flash of light as the gun went off, barking at the tip with a spray of fire
>But the bullet would fly past her right ear, damaging her hearing
>That’s exactly what Samurai Outlaw did, that night
>And you are Samurai Outlaw

>You are Sam again
>Your Dad, having just had his gun knocked from his hand, leaps upon you as the ground starts to quake with the approach of the train, like water might shake during an earthquake
>The back of your head knocks against one of the wooden ties on the tracks, dazing you
>From the corners of your vision you can see your friends rushing down the hill towards you, shouting, waving their arms to try and get the train to stop
>But it won’t stop
>It can’t stop
>And Dad knows this
>”IT’LL BE BOTH OF US!” He roars at you, his coarse voice barely above the train’s own clattering
>”BURDEN!” His hands find your throat
>”THIEF” He squeezes tight, wrapping around you like a noose
>Your eyes shoot open as you feel your last breath trapped in your chest screaming to get out
>Your tiny hands shoot towards his wrists to pry them away
>His grip is too formidable, too practiced and too full of hatred
>There’ll be no dodge this time, not from either of you
>”COWARD!”
>That’s what Jacob used to call you
>Coward
>What else did Jacob say?
>Your mind blurs back as your vision starts to collapse, cold, dark stars clouding the corners of your eyes — oblivion creeping into your sight
>Your whole body is shaking, tossed about from the rumble of the train, the adrenaline, and the fear
>Spittle starts boiling out of your mouth as your eyes roll upwards
>Even with the train bearing down, something quiet — yet sharp — returns to you
>Jacob’s voice comes back to you like a distant and fading echo emanating in the back of your skull
>Some memory from when you were a child
>Filling a sock with gravel
>Your brother standing over you with his bat, saying:
>>”Even if you’re a girl, you just gotta hit a wolf in the nose, and they’re down. Humans, aim for the shins. That’s all you have to worry about. Rabbits? Right in the chest.”

>You pull your formidable legs underneath you as dad presses furious rings into your neckline
>You aim your feet upwards…
>The train blasts its horn, deafening your other ear
>…And rocket your kick upwards, as if you were punting the moon itself

>Your blow connects directly with Dad’s ribcage
>His grip on you goes slack as his body registers the pain
>You pull in gulps of cold air, rejuvenating your body and lungs, feeling as if you’d been drowning inside your own skin
>Dad’s lungs suck inward and his face twists up with shock
>Then his eyes squeeze shut as his arms bend and shoot towards his chest
>Like a giant building collapsing, he drops forward, not unconscious, but stunned enough to give that impression
>Still coughing, you roll off the tracks
>A final dodge
>At the perfect moment
>You raise your head — covered in burrs and scrub grass — and look towards the tracks
>Dad is propping himself up on his palms, coughing
>He turns his head towards you as the full brunt of the train’s headlights hit him, outlining his ragged shape in black and gold
>He opens his mouth to speak one final cruelty
>And then in a blur of steel and the clanging of horns, he’s gone
>As the train rolls on

>You hear muffled sounds all around you, feel the cold of the wind against your fur, ripping through you like you were full of holes 
>All you can do is stare and listen to the sharp ringing that pierces the wall of nothing clouding your senses…
>…And stare at the train, winding by in the night, like a great metal snake bound on tracks of dirty steel
>He tried to kill you
>Your own dad
>Strangely enough, you don’t feel like crying
>Why don’t you want to cry?
>Wasn’t that your own flesh and blood now smeared across the tracks?
>Or, at the very least, the man who acted as your flesh and blood
>Well, no, you can’t say that either
>That devil drunk was no father
>You have nobody
>Except the gentle hands pulling you to your feet
>The concerned, shouting faces of all your friends, the relief so clear in all of them that your throat starts tightening up
>They’re hugging you and grabbing at you and speaking to you, but you can’t hear a word of what they’re saying
>The world is still ringing
>And spinning, too
>The world is spinning faster than you could have ever imagined
>The stars and the swollen moon become a lighted smear across the sky as your legs tremble and give way
>Your eyes glaze over
>The darkness takes hold of you
>The last thing you see is Anon’s face as he takes you by the shoulders, his face soft as patted butter
>And when you shut your eyes and surrender to that darkness, you feel your feet swept out from under you, pulled by the gentle current of the unconscious

>You are Anonymous
>You are not a strong man
>But right now, you could care less about the battery acid sting in your muscles
>Or the cold sweat threading its way down your face
>It’s a welcome feeling
>Because it means you’re keeping Sam safe
>She’s resting in your arms as you carry her bridal-style up the hill, back towards the church
>Under cold and delicate stars, you watch as her timid chest rises and falls
>Her face isn’t relieved
>It isn’t strained
>The worried lines that often bunch up under the dark circles beneath her eyes are absent
>All you see is sheer exhaustion
>You can still see the frustrated, angry marks pressed into her neck like a necklace
>The red lines of fury
>You can even see where his fingers had pressed hard — little splotches of red — as if Sam were molding clay and he was trying to sculpt her into everything he hated
>It makes you hate her Dad even more than you already do
>Soon those marks would fade from Sam
>And old wounds will scab over and heal
>But the scars will remain, like a broken jar
>You can put all the pieces back together, but it will never be the way it once was
>Mike glides up next to you,
>You’re too intent to hear him
>”Can you carry her all the way up?” He says. “Because if you want…”
>His voice trails off
“No. I need to do this,” you say to him
>Even if your arms strain and burn, you’re going to carry this stupid, brave bun all the way to the top
>Mike is silent for a moment, then says: “Police?”
>Your answer is quick and short
“No.”
>”Don’t you think someone will notice that Sam’s dad is gone? I’m no fan of the police myself, but… her dad is dead. There’s a body down there.”
“Good. He was a monster trapped in a memory. He tried to murder his own daughter, and then kill himself.” You cradle Sam’s head in the crook of your arms like you would a child
“As far as I’m concerned he’s better off dead.”
>”You know that was my first time meeting the guy, right?”
“What’s your point?”
>”He didn’t make a great first impression on me either.” Mike spits on the ground
“You should have been there the first time I met him. I about pissed myself.”
>You were nearly at the top of the hill now
>You were tired, sweaty, and your nerves were burnt to a crisp
>Sam obviously had it worse, but at least she was unconscious now and could get some rest
>She deserves that
>”So no police then?” Mike asks again
“We’ll let the conductor call the police — if he ever does. Who knows, there may not be enough of his body even left over to identify. At least, I hope so.”

>The police never came that night
>And neither did sleep
>Alex and Jenna spoke in hushed voices to each other, often rising from their rickety pews to stretch and ask if you were alright
>You were alright
>You were just watching Sam sleep for hours
>Mike stood guard outside, wielding Sam’s baseball bat
>What was there to keep guard from anyway? Do the goths even know where you are?
>Is their behemoth resting in the school somewhere on the night before their ritual can be completed?
>Is there someone in this entire conflict that knows peace right now?
>Maybe it’s you
>Watching Sam, doubled in on herself, not dreaming, not kicking in anxiety, not fighting with demons (real and imagined)
>What you felt at first was concern for her
>Then, as you laid her on the pew in the front row, like an offering to God, letting the full weight of her being rest, relief washed over you as if were water from baptismal springs
>She was alive
>Wanted
>And breathing

>Alex drops down next to you, lowering his frame with an exhausted grace so as not to wake Sam
>”How you holding up?” He says with a tired smile
>His voice is low and scratchy, and for the first time, you sense there’s a small touch of nerve there
“You know, one thing I never thought I’d be doing last weekend was… this…” you say
>”I did.” Alex’s matter-of-fact tone gives you pause
“Bullshit, you didn’t know any of this would happen.”
>”Well, not this specifically.”
>”But I did know we were going to do something important. Something like save the world, and save Sam.”
“Alex,” you sigh, exhaling your nervous energy. Sleep was just starting to fall on you — or maybe it was exhaustion?
>You look down at Sam, who is utterly conked out on the pew
“I’m too tired to play games with you right now.”
>”It’s not a game though. I just know we were meant for this. Some people just have greatness running through their blood.”
“And you’re saying we have greatness in us?”
>”Maybe, I don’t know.” Alex shifts his body nervously
>He absently begins chewing on his nails
>”You remember when we were on the roof?” He says, not looking at you, but instead towards the altar, sitting high on steps of polished wood
“Which time?” You say with a heavy yawn
>When is the sun coming up? It’s gotta be close
>”The first time. On top of the school. So much has changed since then. You, Mike, Sam, Jenna — even me.”
>You close your eyes, fighting sleep
>It’s kind of true
>Sam — she’s proved she’s made of stronger stuff than what she’s been made to think
>That her life is worth living on her own terms
>She’s not a bad replacement for her brother, a burden or a coward
>And you know that, and somewhere deep inside, she probably does too
>That courage will blossom in her, with time, care, and a lot of healing
>Mike… he’s kinder to you
>He seems to care more about you and everyone else, and especially Jenna
>He can’t go it alone anymore and he knows this
>Unfortunately his future is still kind of fucked, but maybe something will change tomorrow?
>Alex… is Alex
>And you
>You’re much less of a coward than you were
>You can sense an anxious strength in you, and not from the curse that the goths gave you
>But from scaring yourself shitless
>You’ve also decided you’re going to college, and though the very idea of leaving Ranchview and everyone and everything you know behind knots your stomach, you’ve decided you’re going to do it — you need to do it
>The thought of Sam all alone in town, nowhere to go, all alone again while you study in some expensive school’s dormhouse, gives you pause
>You care so much for that stupid fucking rabbit that the idea of not leaving is a genuine option for you
>You really, really, really care for her
>You’d tell yourself that you have a crush on her, but you know that’s not true
>You honest to God love her

>”Yes sir,” Alex says in a tired, dragging voice. “Despite all that’s changed since last Friday, I do know one thing.”
>”We are definitely doing something that matters.”

>Sam doesn’t wake with the first of the morning’s light
>You watch it filter into the church, laying bars of gold across the pews
>One of them strikes Jenna directly across the face, who is sitting a few rows behind you
>The fox squints, as if in pain, and then blinks herself awake
>She shields her eyes with the thin length of her arm
>You turn to Alex, who is dozing away
>His snoring fills the whole church
>The way they echo off the high ceilings is vaguely reminiscent of a guttural Gregorian chant
>You were restless the whole night, obsessively watching Sam, just observing the careful rise and fall of her chest, just making sure she was alive
>You forced yourself to fight through sleep and keep a vigil (though you did take some time to read through The Book of Rite a bit more)
>And now the result was a live current of energy singing through your veins
>You can feel your heartbeat stumbling in your chest with a misplaced sense of purpose
>This happened sometimes — you didn’t sleep and then you’d end up with the shakes, but full of energy and purpose
>Still, going into tonight without sleep may not be a great strategy
>Well, no sense in fighting it now
>Everyone would have to be up soon anyway for school
>Sam especially
>You don’t want her to miss her chance at a GED
>She’s missed enough school already

>You go to shake her awake, but stop short, your hand hovering over her
>You can see one of the glossy bulbs of her amber eyes — like molten gold in a crucible — peering up at you through the thick strands of hair that fell over her face in the night
>You lock eyes with her, still frozen
“… Morning…”
>”Morning…” she returns, her voice above a whisper, but not by much
>She still sounds tired
“You… doing alright?”
>Fuck
>What was that?
>She just watched her Dad die
>Even if she didn’t like him, she might still have some weird connection to him
>Who knows?
>And all you can ask is ‘you doing alright?’

>She sits up, stretches, and says, rather flatly: “I-I’m not sure. I d-d-don’t f-f-feel n-nervous. N-Not like I normally do when I-I wake up.”
>She turns and fixes you with a clear gaze, thick ropes of her falling across her face
>”W-W-What do you think t-that means?”
“I… think that’s a good thing?” You say, not sure how to process this or respond
>She nods, slow
“You look better though. Like there’s a weight off you.”
>She doesn’t toss her head to the side in evasion, like she normally would
>Her gaze is clear and steady, like she was looking at you for the first time
>Her fingers still anxiously drum on the pew, however
>”I-I guess? I d-don’t know what t-to feel. H-He was n-no fa-father to me, b-but he was st-still my dad.”
>You open your mouth to speak
>Do you really think you can help this situation?
“Well let me put it like this: do you have any positive memories of him?”
>…
>She stirs a bit, and then turns her head to stare out the cross-shaped glass window that sits over the altar
>”N-No.” She says after a long moment of silence. “I-I tried t-to think of some b-but I can’t. Al-All I ca think of is h-how messed up my head i-is because of h-him.”
>You nod in affirmation
“Well look, I’m not trying to ruin any fond memories you have of him, but you were effectively his prisoner — physically and mentally.”
>”You k-know what?”
>She turns to face you
>”Y-You’re right. I-I-I’m glad he’s gone.”

>Nobody seems to want to talk much about last night, Friday morning
>You all sit around in a semi-circle outside your car, which has become something of a morning ritual for you all, a designated meeting post even
>Still dressed up in your priest costume, you, fruitlessly, try to get people to start talking
“Sooooooooo…” you trail off, unsure of where you were even going to take your sentence. “Today is the day, right?”
>Nobody speaks
>Guess nobody really knows what to say after last night?
>Nobody except Sam
>She gathers her arms around herself, shivering in the frosted Halloween air
>Above her, leaves drift in the wind in a  storm of russet brown, auburn red, and gold
>”I know l-last n-n-night was…”
>She pauses
>”L-Last night w-w-wasn’t e-e-easy.. B-But I wanted to th-thank you a-a-all for being there. A-A-And for being-”
>She looks at her father’s abandoned car, drifting into a sharp memory of angled features and coarse hands; of devil eyes and devil smirks, imprisoning her; trapped in the grasp of a memory
>Shaking her head, she banishes those thoughts — if only for a moment
>You watch her fidget and shake, and know, deep down, she will never be whole again — If she ever was to begin with
>”-F-For being my f-f-friends. I don’t t-t-think I would h-have made it l-long i-if I d-d-didn’t h-have any of you.”
>”None of us,” Mike chimes in, “would have made it this far without each other.”
>…
>He looks around, intensely self conscious and hungover
>”But I ain’t doing a group hug thing, alright? That’s not what I’m saying this is.”
>”Not even as a show of solidarity?” Alex questions in reply
>Mike shrugs. ”Why do we always have to hug and pat ourselves on the back? I get it — we’re all friends now.”
>”Then will you settle for a homo-erotic high-five?” Alex raises his arm in preparation for a very hetero palm tip-to-tip
>”Alright, but you can’t call it that. This is purely a high-five.”
>”Gotcha,” Alex winks at you for some reason. “No homo.”
>Mike groans and slaps Alex’s palm as hard as he can
>Sam and Jenna just exchange looks, while you, the third wheel, the dick between these two balls, just watch with folded arms
>Well this is as close as you’ll get to group hugging
>And that’s alright with you

>When you roll into school, the place is a madhouse
>The five of you stand in the front entrance, wearing your costumes still, slackjawed like a bunch of mouth-breathing, smooth-brained idiots
>The place looks completely transformed, like it was hit by a tidal wave of tacky orange and black decorations, fake skeletons, plastic headstones and of course fake cobwebs that Alex spends a decent amount of time running into
>Let’s not forget the “Spooktober Fest” banner adorning the school’s entrance, hanging above you like a massive guillotine
>Hand-painted wooden signs adorn the halls, directing students to the gym for the night’s festivities
>Some students — mostly humans — are wearing their costumes
>Somehow, looking at those signs proclaiming the Spooktober Fest’s ‘outrageous’ activities (punch, haunted classrooms, cornhole, dancing, pumpkin carving) gives you anxiety
>Sam, however, is overjoyed with the whole thing, almost like she forgot the whole purpose of tonight
>”G-G-G-Guys!” She stammers, eyes wide. “Look how c-cool th-this is!”
>She points a stubby finger at the streamers, tracing their lengths through the air like she was conducting a symphony nobody could see or hear
>”They do this every yea- OW.” Mike winces as Jenna claws him across the arm, carving gashes into his leather jacket
>”Let her have her fun,” Jenna warns him in a hiss
>”You know, you’re awfully aggressive for a girl dressed up as a bumblebee,” he says.
>Sam is gleefully focused on the streamers, and not much else
>You place a hand on her lower back, and she nearly hops a foot into the air
“Sammmmm,” you say in a chiding voice (but you’re being ironic, you swear), “remember why we came to school. So you don’t lose attendance and get expelled. Remember, tonight is the night. Try not to let the decorations distract you.”
>Still shaking, Sam meets you with a steely gaze
>”R-Right. T-These are all j-j-just distractions,” she says with determination
>For effect she throws up her hood and pulls her ears through the holes in the top
>”And I hate to break your immersion,” Alex interjects, “but the Halloween season has been commercialized to the point of meaninglessness. When most people think of Halloween, they think of carting around immortal plastic pumpkins filled with name-brand candy bars and chocolate harvested off the backs’ of enslaved South American lemur children. It’s a far cry from the ancient tradition of Samhain, which are the ACTUAL origins of-”
>”Holy shit, do you need a soapbox or something?” Mike says, still rubbing her clawed arm and grimacing at the deep gouges
>Alex looks confused. “Why, do you have a soapbox with you?”
>”Nevermind,” Mike says. The bell rolls over and shrieks
>And, like actors in a play, the milling students turn towards their classes and leave their conversations behind, thinking there would be another day to have them
>Thinking: they’ll always have Monday to see their friends again
>Or this weekend!
>And as you all fanned out in different directions — Jenna and Mike on their way to English down the hall, Alex down the stairs towards the gym, and you and Sam down another hall towards Sam’s own art class — you saw a little flick of something
>It was a short burst of smoke that appeared and then evaporated as quick as lightning
>At the end of the small hall to your left, with everyone’s backs turned
>You saw the formidable shape of a feral dog, larger than a car and twice as fast
>And you saw Vanessa, two goths at her side, standing at the end of the hall, their shadows stretching outward like the long reaching hands of death
>You and Sam both froze, legs and veins stuffed with concrete
>Were they really there? Or were you seeing things?
>Sam stiffens up, and her ears jolt upward in alarm
>You hear one word that seizes your heart with a pair of calloused, drunken hands
>”D-Dad?” She utters
>You shut your eyes and hope to whatever god(s) there might be that you’re just seeing things
>When you find the courage to open your eyes again, that hallway is empty
>But you feel Sam’s fingers — interlaced with your own — clench up tight, cold sweat threading between the two of you like glue
>Neither of you look at each other, but you say everything you need to with a good squeeze of your palms
>’I’m here for you’
>And that sick, low growl — the sound of something old and feral — fills the halls
>Whatever it is, it’s gone now
>But it’s out there, and it knows:
>Its time is close

>You feel a hit of blood enter your legs, warming them, like a block ice met with a flamethrower
“D-Did you… See that thing too?” You say, pulling against Sam’s immobile form, dragging her away from the short hallway towards the stairs
>You can always take the long way around to Sam’s classroom
>”I-I-I’ve se-seen that b-before,” she stammers, her legs finally obeying her
>Her voice is frantic as she struggles to put some motion into her legs
>You don’t care if you have to drag her like a wounded soldier across a mile of broken glass, you’re getting the FUCK away from that thing and the weird shit you just saw
>”D-D-Did you see my D-Dad?” She says as she finally puts her feet beneath her
>You two travel down the empty stairs and into the lunchroom together
>You’ll take her to class
>But you need a minute
>You sit down on an available table
>Some students still lurk around, probably on their free period
“No. I saw Vanessa and her friends. At the end of the hall with The Behemoth? Didn’t you see them?”
>She shakes her head viciously, ears swinging with her in a tight arc
>”I-It plays t-t-tricks on you. I-It makes you s-s-see things that a-a-aren’t there. L-L-Last time I s-s-saw my b-brother.”
>She suffocates the tips of her ears in her grip
>Without even having to think about it, you clutch at her hands and hold them in your lap
“I remember you saying that. And I remember something similar happening to me. But listen to me.”
>Frantic, nearly on the verge of tears, she looks up into your eyes
“We’re going to be alright. We can’t let them play mind games with us today. We’ve gotta save everything we have for tonight, okay? Like I said, tonight’s Spooktober Fest is our Death Star.”
>Sam looks down at your palms pressed together
>You follow her gaze, and can’t help but notice the way your hands fit together perfectly, like two pieces of a puzzle that had to spend a few years apart before finding that they completed one another
>You feel the warmth pulsing off her little body — you can feel it in the sweat you trade between palms
>”Tonight,” she breathes hard and tries to smile at you
“Tonight.” You echo her words in the same half-whisper
>You lean forward, so close that you can smell your bodywash still on her, the scent of her heat billowing off her like a shroud
>You want to kiss her, so badly, but you know: now isn’t the time
>It was time to be strong, for everyone’s sake
>For Mike
>Jenna
>Alex
>Yourself
>And most of all: Sam
“I swear, I’ll never let anything happen to you, okay?”
>There’s a slight pause as Sam studies you
>She’s not questioning the validity of your words
>More so just searching your eyes for something real to latch onto and hold herself to
>Finding it, some light where all the shadows divide, she nods and tightens her grip on your fingers
>’I’ll never let anything happen to you, okay?’
>The words resonate in your mind as you stand up, pulling Sam with you
>You swear to yourself, to everything that you fought for and believe in:
>You are all going to be okay. You won’t let anything happen to anyone

>Oh how wrong you are

>School is utterly pointless
>With all the buzz about the Spooktober Fest, classes involve the students pitching in to help set up the school for some sp00ky fun
>Which really translates to students hauling in shit from around the school and moving it into the gym
>You stick close to Sam, watching from the hallways as she struggles to lug a cheap wooden stockade towards the gym
>Why the school has a stockade you can only guess, but you can tell it’s not heavy
>It’s probably made out of cheap particleboard from any home improvement store
>So you take one step forward, dead-set on helping her haul that-
>A foreign hand finds its way onto your shoulder
>”There’s my star student. I was wondering when I’d see you again.”
>Oh
>Mr. Bolm
>You turn your back against Sam, though you’re still eager to end this conversation and go help
>Mr. Bolm is standing before you, dressed up like a wizard
>He’s clad in a purple velvet robe, and his receding hairline is hidden beneath a pointed, purple wizard hat
>In his right hand he has a gnarled walking stick, probably his ‘staff’
>And in his left is a biology textbook, which functions as his ‘book of spells’
“Hi, Mr. Bolm,” you say, eying him up and down. “Kind of hypocritical for you to be dressed up as a wizard, right?”
>He looks taken back
>”Why is that? Don’t you believe in magic?” He says with false gruffness to his voice
>Wat
“I-I mean, I guess so-”
>”Nahhhh,” Mr. Bolm says with a slight hissing laugh that makes you feel a little more comfortable around him. “This is what I wear when I play tabletop. I DM for a group of faculty.”
>Seeing your incredulous expression, he adds: “Who shall remain nameless.”
>Of all the weird and wack shit you’ve seen this week, seeing Mr. Bolm dressed as a corny-ass wizard and admitting that some teachers around school play tabletop games with him is the most unbelievable thing yet
>There’s an awkward pause in the conversation
>Mr. Bolm LOOKS like he has something he wants to say to you, but doesn’t know how to say it
>Guess you’ll just have to cut the silence
“Sorry I haven’t been in class,” you blurt out. “I’ve been… really busy with some things around school. And at home.”
>Your teacher looks relieved that you started the conversation back up again
>”I guess as an educator I’m supposed to chastise you for truancy, but…” he shrugs. “I trust you. Senior year and all that. I remember being in high school as well — all the excitement and energy of 12 years of education all building towards a head. Like the crescendo of a really great song. Ironically, your education seems to matter the least when it should matter the most.”
>He holds up his hands in a gesture of humility. “Believe me. I’ve been there. I just wanted to make sure you’re coming back to class. I wouldn’t want you to jeopardize your future.”
>If you make it out alive tonight, yeah, sure, you’ll go back to basic biology and shit you’ve already read
“Yes sir,” you say, turning back to focus on Sam, who is still struggling with the stockades
>She seems to have made almost no progress
>Other students — with empty hands — pass by her like she’s not even there
>The sight spikes your blood pressure a fair bit
>Fucking assholes could care less about Sam
>Why?
>Well… a week ago you were trying to avoid her like the plague, to be fair
>Mr. Bolm clears his throat behind you
>”Err, Mr. Anonymous?”
>You turn around again, and the expression on your face makes Mr. Bolm pause
>”You alright there?” He says apprehensively
>”Need to use the bathroom?”
>You shake your head and clear the expression from your face
“N-No, sorry. Just thinking.”
>”Well…” Mr. Bolm drags out the last syllables to a high ‘luh’ like he does sometimes
>C’mon you magical fuck, get to the point
>Can’t he see that your waifur needs you?
>”What I really wanted to ask you about was college. Have you given any more thought to it?”
>…
>Oh
>Right
>Yeah, your future
>When you declared on the rooftop on Thursday, how serious were you?
>The very utterance of the word ‘college’ makes your stomach drop into your bowels
>The thought of leaving scares you half to death
>But
>You’ve done a lot of things that scare you this week
>In fact, you’ve scared the shit out of yourself so many times, you’re not sure who the old, cowardly Anonymous even is anymore
>Unlikes what Vanessa thinks, people do in fact change
>You’ve seen everyone around you change and grow, like the leaves of fall ripening on their branches and exploding with color as the seasons turn over
>Every season is built on change
>And so are people
“Yeah, as a matter of fact, I have thought about school,” you say at last
>Mr. Bolm leans forward, eyebrows high on his forehead, nearly disappearing into the brim of his wizard hat
“I think I’d like to give college a try. I don’t really… know where, or what, but I know I’d like to go. Like you said, I’d be wasting my time staying in Ranchview.”
>The smile that explodes across your teacher’s face almost knocks you off your feet
>”That’s so great to hear! Oh my god, I’m so happy you said that!”
>A look of relief mixed with joy spreads across Mr. Bolm’s features
>He even cranes his neck upward and exhales sharply, forming a tight ‘O’ with his mouth
>After a slight pause, he turns his head downward again
>”Well, listen. How about next week you come by my classroom after school ends, and we can look at some scholarships together. If you’re worried about cost, don’t be. I know of some GREAT scholarships for STEM students, if you’re thinking of going into the sciences.”
>T-Thanks
>You feel a rush of blood to the head
>This is all moving so fast
>STEM? Sciences? Scholarships?
>Last Friday you were pretty sure you were going to be staying in Ranchview forever, and now you’re practically picking a time and a place for your old life to end and new one to begin
>You feel dizzy
“I-I will,” you look at him and try to smile
>Mr. Bolm is too overjoyed to really pick up on your shift in mood and posture
>You’re practically keeled over in your priest vestments, clutching a locker for support
>”Great!” He proclaims. “I’ll see you on Monday!”
>Still smiling, he turns on a sharp heel
>Thank fuck that’s ov-
>”Oh and one more thing.” He turns back on an even sharper heel, his cloak billowing around him like a cyclone of purple felt and velvet
>You see he’s wearing pointed brown boots
>Man, he really goes all out
>”Are you going to the Spooktober Fest tonight?”
>Your stupid lizard brain is moving so fast in so many directions that all you can say is:
“Yes?”
>”Good!” He proclaims. “You kids need to have some fun. This has been the week from hell — all the fights and the vandalism and all — I think everyone is ready for a break, or for the end of the world,” he adds with a laugh. “Let’s just hope it’s the former and not the latter.”

>”At least the garlic makes sense.” Mike folds his arms across his chest
>It was a little after 4 in the afternoon
>You’re all back at the church now, except for Mike, who is watching from the front doors, which you’ve propped open with a few rocks
>Your heart flutters as you watch Alex and Jenna rip open plastic and cardboard boxes containing squirt guns and water pistols
>In fact, you pace unevenly up and down the aisles, constantly checking your phone
>You need a place to put your apprehension and anxiety
>The Spooktober Fest was in five hours
>You’ll need to bring Sam and the red book with you, deep into enemy territory, secure The Book of Wrath from Vanessa, and undo the ritual before midnight or EVERYONE, not just the ‘normies’ (as Vanessa might say) are fucked
>Before everyone goes mad with lust and hatred and evil, all at the behest of The Behemoth
>Oh, right
>Yeah, that hallucinatory dog-thing that’s lurking somewhere in the school RIGHT NOW probably, uncontrollable by Vanessa since Sam fudged the ritual up about a week ago
>”But I don’t get the water pistols. We’ve got an army of goths, vampires, an insane janitor and trans-dimensional monster to plow through, and you’re bringing squirt guns?” Mike says
>Well put, Mike
>It’s like he can read your mind or sense your anxiety
>You even complete each other’s sentences sometimes, like an old married couple
>But this is no time for gay jokes
>”Quit being such a pessimist.” Jenna stands up with a see-through pink water pistol in her hands. She trots past you, still in her bumblebee costume, to where the baptismal font is, near the entrance of the church
>Its waters are still with the powers of purification
>She dunks the pistol into the font, its surface shattering like fragile glass
>A few sputters and gurgles of air rise to the top as concentrated vampire repellent fills up the pistol’s body
>She rips her arm from the font, pulling the pistol up with it in a spray not unlike that of waterfalls that cascade down mountain cliffs in forgotten jungles
>The last rays of light that pour in from the cross-shaped window at above the altar strike the water pistol so perfectly that it was like God himself was blessing that little $1 toy from China
>”Behold!” She announces. “A blessed water pistol!”
>You half expected a choir of angels to open up and shower you all in shimmering and airy harmonies
>Instead, Jenna spins on her heels and aims the gun at Mike
>”Hold still,” she says, slamming one eye shut as she sights down the length of the ‘weapon.’
>Mike takes a cautious step backwards. ”Wait, hold on. We don’t know what that-”
>He never finishes his sentence
>Instead, a pathetic piss-stream of water strikes him in the shoulder, though most of it is absorbed by his shirt
>And that’s right about when he started yelling
>As if he were a smoldering blaze suddenly doused in an ice-bath, steam rises from his shoulder where he was struck
>He scrambles and struggles to wipe the holy stain from his shirt, but it only gets on his hands, causing him to scream louder
>Jenna throws down the water pistol and dashes to Mike’s side
>In his panic (or out of contempt) he pushes her aside
>The fox goes stumbling down onto her ass, and lets out a panicked yelp
>”Holy FUCK!” Mike says, ripping his shirt off and whipping it to the side
>He looks even more pale now that he’s bare-chested, his skin the sickly color of cream cheese
>You have to admit: when he first looked down at Jenna, who was sitting up on her palms, you thought Mike might kill her then and there
>Instead, he looks down at the burn mark on his shoulder
>The whole spectacle is a little…
>Gross?
>”That was fucking wild,” he says. “I can’t believe that worked so… so… so well!”
>Jenna hobbles to her feet
>Her bumblebee costume makes her look like a massive, striped marble, propped up on her two thin little legs
>”What?” She whispers under her breath
>Saying she was relieved and astonished would be an understatement
>She looks like someone just pulled her cub from the crumbling wreckage of a burning building
>The dark shadow of Mike falls upon Jenna as he turns to face her
>Mania burns in his eyes
>”That’s brilliant. Do you know that?”
>Jenna can only stare on, slackjawed
>Steam rises off Mike into the sky
>”I said, it’s brilliant. The squirt guns. Filling them with holy water. Did you come up with that?”
>Jenna nods, her eyes still split wide and jaw slack
>You feel as if Mike’s words are reaching her, but her concern has overridden everything else except primitive motion
>Mike turns his attention towards the remaining water pistols and the large water gun leaning near the baptismal font
>His eyes settle on its smooth, bulbous plastic form, painted green and purple (thanks doc)
>There’s a huge reservoir in the back for water, and a gimmicky orange pump at the front for, well, pumping water
>”I want that one,” he says dimly, like a child with his eyes on candy
>”Mike, wait,” Jenna tries to stand between him and the water gun. “You can’t.”
>”And why not?” He says, a tinge of frustration in his voice
>Jenna motion towards his burnt shoulder. "You’re lucky I only got you with a little bit.”
>”Bah, I’ll be careful.”
>”I’m serious! I don’t want you doing anything crazy or dangerous!” She growls
>Mike is unperturbed. “This is coming from the woman that just shot me with holy water. Right.”
>She assumes a defensive stance, barring her fangs and spreading her body wide, claws extended
>She’s the fiercest looking bumblebee you’ve ever seen
>He brushes past her with ease, however, his shirt in hand, stopping only at the entrance of the church, as if held in place by an invisible hand
>Jenna stamps her feet
>”God damnit Mike!”
>Mike turns his attention to her. “Listen, Jenna, sweetie, babycakes, sugartits, I’m going to be okay.”
>In turn, Jenna bows her head, hiding her face
>But from this angle, you can see it tighten up with frustration
>Her body starts trembling
>Oh shit
>This isn’t about the water gun
>”You better be okay,” she says, her voice struggling against the tightness of her throat
>When she looks up again there are tears stinging her eyes
>”You better not do anything stupid or dumb or crazy, you hear me Mike Sapone?”
>Mike doesn’t say anything back
>His brows narrow together and slowly, he nods
>”I promise you,” he says, turning to face all of you
>”You hear that? These motherfuckers took away my future. I don’t want any of you doing something stupid — that’s my job. I want my future back, or at least some fingers to break. And I need all of you to stay alive tonight, because if the world ends, I’m at least doing it in good company.”
>You have to admit, the way he’s looking around at everyone makes you think that he might attack any one of you at a moment’s notice for saying the wrong thing
>Jenna scrubs her eyes with the back of her paws
>“If you get hurt I’ll fucking kill you.”
>Honestly, you’re more surprised that she’s swearing over the fact that she’s crying
>Whatever, it’s probably one of those emotional things that are super out of your range
>”You can kill me after I kick Vanessa and Lydia’s dreary asses back to hell.”
>Alex obediently hands Mike the squirt gun, which Mike hoists onto his shoulders
>You can’t help but think back to Sam’s drawings for you all
>He really is ‘Slayer,’ as unoriginal as that sounds
>You shrug. Guess they fit

>You all sit on the hood of your car and suck down on Dr. Beppers, cheap burgers and lukewarm beer
>You watch as the sun sets, washing everything in a thin orange haze
>Your heart hurls itself against your ribcage, even with Sam sitting next to you on the hood
>She seems to be in the same place you’re at, mentally
>Or it’s the caffeine?
>Her legs kick off against the front-end of the car, and her whole body shakes as she brings the can of Dr. Bepper to her lips
>You can feel The Book of Rite in your pocket, heavy and flat like Mike’s sister
>Nobody says much as you watch the sun set, counting the minutes as they turn into hours
>Pretty soon darkness swallows you all, and the lights in the church flick on, as if God were home for the night
>Mike hops off the hood of the car, glowing white with anemia
>He’s still holding the squirt gun
>He still seems pretty attached to it
>”Well,” he says, his fiery-red gaze sweeping the group, and ending on you. “What’s the time?”
“7:30,” you say, shoving your phone back into your pocket.
>A smile forms on his lips, though its hard to see in the darkness
>”Shall we?”

>You dunk a water pistol into the baptismal font whose waters never seem to run dry
>The pistol gurgles and sputters as it fills
>Just for safety reasons, you dunk Gloria’s crucifix (still around your neck) in the font
>Sam, Jenna, and Alex string together garlic necklaces from the garlic bulbs Jenna ‘paid for’ on Tuesday
>You fill the other two water pistols up as your brain works your confidence over with a lead pipe
>Mike’s words echo in your ears
>’We’ve got an army of goths, vampires, werewolves, an insane janitor and trans-dimensional monster to plow through, and you’re bringing squirt guns?’
>Would this really be enough? Not to mention the general violence
>And
>The Behemoth
>A stream of water hits you in the face, shattering your anxious wanderings
>Mike is standing at the entrance of the church, pumping water at you
>”This thing has RANGE baby. You feel that?”
“Hey I’m not refilling that if you keep shooting it at me.” You wipe your face down with your shirt
>”No worries my possibly bisexual friend, I’m just getting my range down.”
“Right, well, don’t do it with me.”
>”C’mon, you know you like it when Mikey gets you all wet.”
>You flip off Mike and return to your task
>Everywhere there’s motion
>Garlic necklaces laced around necks (and any extras go into pockets)
>Water pistols passed out to Alex and Jenna
>And more importantly, beers
>Sam totters off to your car, its doors open and headlights on, 
>They blast against the peeling white paint of the church
>She comes sprinting back at break-neck speed, her garlic necklace bouncing against her hoodie
>But you see she’s not empty-handed when she returns
>She’s got a length of rope and…
>Ah shit
>Her brother’s bat, in her right hand
>”H-H-Hey A-Anon. I-I need some help wi-with this.” She offers up the rope and the baseball bat
>You stuff your water pistol into a belt loop under your robes (which really completes the whole ‘priest’ look) and tie the baseball bat around her shoulders and under her arms, securing it to her back
>She ties the red bandanna around her snout and throws her hood over her head, shoving her ears through the holes you so graciously cut at the top of her hoodie
>She looks up at you, her amber eyes shrouded in shadow, peering up at you from the darkness like two lights in a tunnel
>”H-H-H-How do I look?” She says cautiously
>You crouch down to her height
“You look great, but you’re missing something.”
>She yanks down her bandanna
>”W-W-What?”
You plant a quick kiss on her lips
>Just a short one, but long enough so that your taste lingers on her tongue
“My luck.” Your voice drops to a whisper
>Sam lets out a shy squeak
>In an instant, her head is pointed to her shoes
>”Y-Y-Your costume is so nice,” she says evasively
>Your heart sinks
>Maybe that was too soon
“Thanks. I like it too, I gues-”
>She jumps forward and plants a clumsy kiss on your lips, and lingers there, pressed against you, for far too long
>You said it once, you’ll say it again: why do you always attract the weirdos?
>When you at last pull apart, she looks distraught, her brows sloping up and her mouth curled down into a frown, slight distress pressed into her features
>”S-Sorry.”
>…
“For what?”
>”I c-c-couldn’t think of a-a-anything clever to s-s-say.”

>You want to spend forever with her, here, in this crummy old church, shooting water pistol’s at Mike’s feet, shivering as a breeze sweeps the leaves by like handfuls of confetti thrown to the wind
>But forever isn’t in the cards for you tonight
>The hours roll by, and your reserve stock of fortifying beer and Dr. Beppers runs dry as you chill by the front doors with Mike
>He looks especially manic today, chugging his beer and howling at the moon, which has grown alarmingly fat and red in the sky
>He swipes the back of his hand across his mouth, catching the last drops of beer
>”God, I don’t even care how close to oblivion we all are. I’m just ready to get some revenge and break some knees.”
>Jenna appears beside him with a Dr. Bepper
>”Here. Try and sober up a little bit. You’re no good to us drunk.”
>”Drunk?” He stumbles backwards in one small inebriated step. “Listen, let me tell you something. I fight better when I’m a little bit loaded.”
>”S-So d-d-did my d-d-dad,” Sam says to nobody in particular
>Mike pauses in his swagger
>The cringe on his face says it all
>”I didn’t mean it like that,” Mike says, a foreign shame creeping into his whispering tone
>”O-Oh!” Sam shakes her head. “N-Neither d-d-did I. S-S-Sorry. I’m just th-thinking about some o-other stuff.”
>Right
>’Other stuff.’
>The taste of Sam still lingering on your lips offers some insight as to what she’s probably thinking about
>You didn’t want the moment to end either
>Kissing her feels… right… like how a fish was born to swim, you know?
>You stare up at the moon in silence and take a hearty slug of your beer
>Liquid courage
>And you’re going to need it

>Like a pair of well-meaning school shooters, you opt not to park your shit heap car in the now crowded parking lot, but in the teacher’s lot out front
>It’ll be a longer haul to the gym versus the student lot, but that’s okay
>You might need to make an escape later, and you don’t want to be caught in traffic
>Wouldn’t it be bad ass if you guys had a car chase? Like damn, that-
>”Anon.” Alex shakes the back of your seat. “Are you ready comrade?”
>You cut the engine
”You’re freaking me out man, I feel like I’m about to go shoot up the school or something.”
>”Don’t get cold feet on us right now, bunny-boy. We need you to get to that altar with Sam,” Mike says, now more sober than before. “What time you got?”
>Jenna checks her phone. ”10:45. We’re cutting it close.”
>”Cut it too soon and we’re going to show up before show time and get caught,” Alex offers, one of the few intelligent statements he’s made. “Too late and… well…”
>”So, front doors, guns blazing?” Mike says, pumping on his over-sized squirt gun. He rests his hand on the door handle, eager to get moving
“If you can control yourself, I was thinking stealth. We really only need to worry about the vampires”
>As you rattle off a list of potential foes, your stomach sinks further and further
>”…The goths, Lydia, Vanessa, whatever they did to Gloria… The Behemoth…”
>If you weren’t nervous before, you were now
>Your feet beat into the shitty, carpeted floor of the rustbucket
>Sam, picking up on your nerves, wrings her ears like she was trying to squeeze the blood out of them
>”A-A-And what d-d-do we do?” She asks, staring dead ahead at the school
>Ordinarily you’d say the school was looming in the darkness, but it’s not dark
>Not at all
>Above the school the moon is pinned low into the sky, glowing a near scarlet red
>You’re reminded of the moon in Majora’s Mask, when the celestial body would get close and closer each day 
>Publications called it a ‘harvest moon’
>You and your friends knew better
“W-When we get into the s-school-”
>Shit, did you stutter?
>It’s either nerves, or that Sam is rubbing off on you
>Or both
>You swallow hard and feel for the The Book of Rite tucked into your pocket
>It feels loose, so you push deeper down in there
>Don’t need it flying out
>It takes a few earth-spinning seconds, but you finally put your thoughts together like the broken puzzle pieces that they are
>Remember, Anonymous: you’ve changed. People are capable of change and growth
>You and your friends are living examples
>And yet, here you are, wishing to be anywhere else in the world, wishing to slink away and let someone else handle it
>But you are ‘someone else’
>Alex shakes your seat again
>”Comrade, are you alright?”
>You wave your wrist in a dismissive fashion
>If only to try and dismiss the nerves
“I’m a-alright. What I was saying was: when we get in there, we’ll need cover from all of you in getting to the gym. Vanessa knows that  I know there’s a way to stop this. I imagine it’s going to be heavily guarded by Vanessa’s thugs, and whatever supernatural spookery she can concoct.”
>”And you know how to stop it?” Jenna says
>You turn to face her, which is a struggle considering you’re still wearing your seatbelt
“Both books brought to the altar, and Sam’s freshly drawn blood ought to banish The Behemoth and put an end to this whole thing.”
>”H-How fresh?” Sam squeaks at you, her body still shaking
>You flash a grim look at her
>”Like, straight from your wrists fresh, since it was your blood that ruined the ritual the first time. I found a banishing ritual when I was browsing through The Book of Rite a few days ago.”
>Sam’s anxious foot-pounding is so loud that even Jenna tries to get her to calm down
>Deep breaths, everyone
>Remember all that you’ve learned
“So you’ll need to go up there with me,” you continue. “And we’ll need cover from the rest of you, whatever that looks like.”
>”So like I said, guns blazing,” Mike adds
>He seems about the only one excited for this
>Or, rather, he seems mad
>Which for him often look like the same thing
>You won’t lie, the dark and edgy looks he’s been flashing ever since you were gearing up in the church have been concerning you
>You exhale slowly, trying to remember what your therapist told you about anxiety and fear
>’Take all of your fear and worry and put it into a little ball that-’
>Bah, fuck it
>Your therapist can’t help you at the end of the world
>Only you can
>”I’m tired of waiting. I’m ready to light this candle,” Mike says
>”As am I,” Alex concurs. “The revolution has come to its climax. Once more, friends, to the barricades again!”
>”Everyone, just be safe.” Jenna pops open her side door and steps out into the cool air. “Especially you, Mike. I don’t want you doing anything stupid.”
>”I’m going to do what I have to do, but I promise I’ll try not to get anyone hurt,” he says in reply
>Though you can’t see them, you can tell just by the tone of Jenna’s voice that she’s worried. Their conversation continues, but you can’t hear anything, because Alex is humming the Soviet anthem loudly
>He pauses
>”Everything be okey, komrade.”
>GOD his accents are bad
>He sounds like a Bond villain
>Still humming the Soviet anthem, Alex exits the vehicle, leaving only you and Sam, and the mutual sound your feet pounding into the floor
>Focus on the moon, dude
>Just… chill
>You’re a lot stronger now than you were before
>Still, what’s with this feeling in your gut?
>This otherworldly anxiety as you watch the sky get swallowed by the moon
>It dominates the whole skyline, and you swear you can almost feel its gravitational tug, like it could rip you out of this car and suck you into orbit
>A shaking, fuzzy hand finds your own
>It’s Sam
>She’s no longer pulling at her ears, but she still wears all the signs of nervousness as plain as the bandanna tied around her neck
>Kicking legs, trembling features, quivering lips flush with blood
>Yet her eye contact is impeccable — something you’re pleased that she’s learned
>You drink in her glowing amber eyes, searching for courage
>”W-W-We’re g-gonna b-b-b-be okay r-r-right?”
>You swallow and nod
>”R-Right. We’ve all come so far. We’ll be okay. And l-like I said, I won’t let anything bad happen to you.”
>She breathes out a held breath and squeezes her eyes shut
>She tries putting on a brave smile
>”Y-Yeah. I-I’m a lot s-s-stronger than I-I was. I’ll d-d-do my best to t-t-take care of m-myself i-in there.”
>Mike slaps the hood of the car, causing you both to jump
>You’d have hit the ceiling were it not for your seatbelt
>His voice is muffled, but you hear him well enough. ”LET’S GO LADIES.”
>You and Sam share one last look
“Ready?”
>”R-Ready,” she says
>You unbuckle your seatbelt

>The hallway that leads to the lunchroom (and then gym) presses up on all sides, as if it became narrower in some portions and then wider in others
>You wipe your brow of sweat as you lead your gang down the empty halls
>The heat snuck up on you at first — a slow and sweaty rise in temperature
>You’re reminded of the metaphor about the frog being boiled alive, never noticing a thing
>Only, you know, it’s more literal than that this time
>And you do notice
>”I think the janitor left the heat on.” Alex slumps over a bit as you continue down the hall
>”No stopping,” Mike breathes, drawing on the sweaty, humid air
>More than a frog metaphor, you’re reminded of last Friday, up in the annals of the school
>It was so hot you all collapsed
>And you can guess why
“God this is a long hallway,” you wheeze
>You should have asked Vanessa to make you athletic and not brave
>Not that it matters now anyway — that buff left you Tuesday
>”Shouldn’t we at least see someone out here? Like in the halls?” Jenna says, leaning up against the lockers in her bee costume. I find it very hard to believe everyone is in the gym right now and STAYING there.”
>”After all you’ve seen with us, that’s what you have the hardest time believing?” Mike says
>”You’re lucky you’re cute, Sapone.” Jenna half-assedly waves her holy water squirt gun in Mike’s face
>It looks like everyone is melting there in the hallways, like plastic army soldiers put to the blowtorch
>The gradual rise in temperature is going to do you in yet again
>Sam draws her baseball bat and stands alert, taking the lead away from you
>”I-I-I-I hear s-s-something,” she whispers
>Her whisper is useless
>A hysterical voice booms from the ceilings
>”OF COURSE YOU HEAR SOMETHING, DARLING!”
>You groan
>Not this bitch again
>”YOU HEAR THE STORM. AND THE STORM IS…”
>There’s a rattling behind the group
>Ceiling tiles fall and clatter onto the floors like glass plates
>And then
>Threading down on a line of rope like a corpulent Spider-Man(Woman) is none other than than Stella the janitor
>Ah, yes, the crazy crystal badger
>The one who assaulted you on Tuesday
>She plops down like a sock filled with yogurt, landing unceremoniously in a big pile of fur and psychosis
>She’s dressed in… oh god
>Like a sexy nurse
>How did the spill of her rather impressive cleavage and the deep cut of her shirt ever make it into a school?
>Didn’t the other staff see th-
>”THE STORM IS ME.” She wheezes and stands upright, arms wide, claws bared
>Hands down the shittiest iteration of Solid Snake yet
>Thanks Kojima
>”That’s right you thieving fucks, I’ve been waiting for you to show your face again.” Even in the darkness you can see her face screwing up with madness, froth dripping from the corners of her mouth
>Her rose quartz earrings dangle from her ears, strung up in gold
>Her eyes settle on Sam, who shrinks away from her manic gaze like a dog flinches away from beatings
>”I should have never trusted you. Your betrayal was revealed to me in a dream, and yet I chose to ignore it. I never thought my own minimum-wage employee would betray me, and yet here I stand, half-naked in a dark hallway on Halloween, prepared to assault a bunch of teenagers.”
>She lurches forward, still winded from the titanic effort of sitting upright
>”I taught you EVERYTHING you needed to fight off the Glowing Ones, (((them))), Grays- and you threw it all in my face, Sam.”
>”Y-You didn’t teach me any-anything e-e-except how t-t-to make c-c-chlorine g-g-gas and e-e-eat crystal p-powders,” Sam blurts as she nervously reaches for her baseball bat
>You tense up, and your heartbeat quickens
>If you need to, you will throw yourself at this crazy bitch
>Sam’s defensive stance does nothing to deter the badger 
>”You can ignore dreams,” Stella froths, “but you can’t ignore destiny. And tonight, your destiny is-”
>Alex steps between Stella and the group, his lanky, striped-suit-clad form like a pillar of sanity in the face of Stella’s unhinged madness
>And thank fuck Alex is going to take the hit for this, maybe he’ll belt her one in the-
>”I’m sorry, but how did you know about the Glowing Ones?” He says
>F U C K
>Stella comes to an abrupt halt, and you swear you see her eyes fill with the sharp light of clarity
>”How do you know about the Glowing Ones?” Alex presses her, his hand inside his suit jacket, as if her were concealing a pistol
>Which isn’t ENTIRELY wrong, you just know what kind of pistol it is
>”You’re one of them, aren’t you?” Stella takes a tactical step backwards and assumes a low, combat-ready stance. “Well try all your mind zog on me, it won’t work. I’ve swallowed enough red pills to piss blood.”
>”Comrade! Please! We mean you no harm. We are no Glowing Ones, Grays, Jews or anyone else in the NWO cabal.”
>Stella snarls in reply. “Exactly what a deep state operative would say.”
>Yet she hasn’t thrown her impressively large, scantily clad body at Alex, who is standing firm — the barrier between the gang and Stella
>Soon, though
>In a matter of seconds, Stella will snap like a brittle twig, and assault Alex
>Your muscles ache from all the tension
>”I assure you, we are no friends of the deep state or the CIA. I share in your struggles against imperialism and oppression, comrade. Please, lower your claws. We are no enemies.”
>The badger hesitates
>”Imperialism? What are you talking about?”
>Oh god, here we fucking go
>Stella does not lower her claws
>Or wipe the froth from her mouth
>But she hasn’t lunged at anyone’s throat yet, and that’s a good sign
>You can only see Alex’s back, but you can tell, just from the context of the conversation that he’s wearing the most obnoxious, holier-than-thou grin
>Stella is about to get a crash course in poorly-researched history and conspiracy theories
>Actually, wait
>This might be a good thing (not only because Alex will finally have someone to talk to who is ‘woke’)
>You take a step back
>And then another
>You tap Sam on the shoulder
>She jumps a little, but seems to get the message, and takes a quiet step in sync with you…
>As do Mike and Jenna
>”Let’s start with the 50s and 60s.” Alex shoves his hands easily into his over-sized pockets, adopting a casual lean. “Ever heard of a little thing called MKUltra?”
>Stella gasps. “How did you know?”
>WIKIPEDIA YOU STUPID BITCH
>She sounds as if Alex is the only other person on earth who knows about the CIA’s actual attempts to devise a truth serum, which only serves to further spike your blood pressure
>Ah Christ, okay, now’s the best time to take your leave before you call them both retarded

>You turn tail (in Jenna’s case, literally) and throw yourself into a run down the hall, aiming for the gym
>Er, it’s more like a shamble in your long robes, but you get the picture
>THE POINT IS you’re making a quick getaway, and the gym is so tantalizingly close
>You lift the hem of your robes as you break into what could only be called a gallop
>Jenna hobbles alongside you in her bumblebee costume, while Mike sprint ahead in a leather blur
>H-HE’S FAST
>When you look behind you, you see Alex still standing there, explosively gesturing at Stella, while the badger explosively gestures back
>You can only catch little shards and fragments of what they’re saying
>’Bourgeoisie’
>’The Glowing Ones’
>’Class-Consciousnesss’
>’Muh crystals’
>The stream of weird bullshit recedes into the sounds of your feet pounding against the floor
>Alex, the brave solider that he is, will have to deal with Syliva himself
>You sneak quick peek at your phone
>11:00 p.m.
>One hour left

>The remaining four of you post up outside the gym’s double-wide doors
>From the window slits on the doors you can see… a lot of fog… and a lot of strobe lights
>You hear the pulse and thrum of bass-heavy music, no doubt some PG attempts at making a banger a bunch of horny high school kids can attempt to grind to
>Not that there probably aren’t shit load of chaperones in there, obscured by the industrial fog machine, waiting in the wings to curb stomp any hormonal urges
>Mike places a palm on the door and looks to you
>”You guys ready?” He grips his water blaster close to his chest
>Come to think of it…
>You pat your pocket where The Book of Rite is. You shove it back down
>…Yeah
>You’re ready

>You take one last look over your shoulder at Alex…
>Who is no longer there with Stella
>In fact, the whole hallway is empty
>Oh boy
>No time to stop now though, not with the clock ticking
>You give Mike an affirmative nod, which is returned to you by your co-conspirator
>Jenna draws her water pistol
>And the doors open
>And…
>Chunky clouds of fog roll out and blanket your feet in a slow parade
>An impressive wall of sound hits you
>First, low bass
>Then high shrieks that sound unnatural to you
>And murmurs
>And the smell of sulfur and and bodies and sweat
>Flashing strobes pulse against the obscuring clouds of fog
>You can see shapes and shadows veiled behind the wall of mist, but nothing more
>Mike steps first into the gym
>Then Jenna
>And then you
>And then Sam, her baseball bat at the ready

>You see… almost exactly what you expected
>The massive gym has been ‘transformed’ by the concentrated efforts of an insane badger and the school board
>Long, cloth-covered tables burdened with candy and drinks are pressed up to the side of the gym, each table draped in spiderwebs and spewing gallons of voluminous fake fog from beneath the draped cloths
>The center of the gym hosts a DJ table and several sizable loudspeakers
>Behind a MacBook, with chunky headphones on, is a rat who looks far too small next to the impressive loudspeakers on each side of the table
>You can’t place why, but she looks somewhat familiar
>From above strobe lights and stage lights flash and pulse like spotlights on the hunt for someone in the crowd
>And surprisingly, there’s a lot of students here
>At least, more than you thought
>But you can only see their faint outlines as they’re traced against the fog by the pulsing strobes and stage lights
>It IS Halloween, shouldn’t most of these kids be out at crazy parties like Braydon Smith’s last night?
>Guess only the losers are here
>Which makes you…
>Never mind

>You move deeper into the gym, your only real goal being the equipment storage room against the walls
>Mike, very slowly, brings his water gun around the room
>”Where the fuck is everyone? I thought there would be more resistance than this.”
>”I don’t trust this,” Jenna adds as the four of you make it deeper into the gym
>The center of the gym is… too clear
>And the shapes in the fog are starting to shift and move, which draw your eye
“Just keep moving. Sam,” you don’t look down at her. You keep your gaze spinning around the fog-cloaked gym, watching as the shadows in the fog shift and move. “Do you hear anything?”
>”J-Just the music!” She strains to be heard above the thrum of the music. “B-But i-i-it sm-smells like… w-w-warm bodies.”
>”No kidding,” Jenna adds. “I can’t get a bead on anything in particular. There’s too much going on in here.”
>Well, if they’re here, you wouldn’t know it
>They might have done a great job of cloaking their presence from the two anthros in the group
>Or it’s entirely unintentional
>You just can’t take your eyes off the silhouettes in the fog
>They’re all around you as you reach the center of the gym and emerge from another bank of fog
>Fuck, you’re already halfway to the equipment room
>You approach the DJ table cautiously
>The rat pays you no mind
>She continues to jam away, bouncing her head to the pulsing electronic music
>The music is painful for you at this distance, you’re sure it’s almost deafening for Jenna and Sam
>”Christ!” Mike turns around and shouts. “There’s no way it should be this easy!”

>”You’re right.”
>A voice — too familiar to you — booms over the loudspeakers
>Vanessa
>The music abruptly cuts
>The rat behind the table looks up at you four, her eyes glowing red with fire
>Fuck
>How did you not see it before?
>The rat smiles with a pair of obvious fangs pressed against her lower lips
>You know that rat
>She was with Vanessa on Tuesday
>”We didn’t want to make it too easy for you. But God, are you kidding me?” Vanessa’s obnoxious whine on the speakers; the four of you suddenly under the pointed spotlights
>Weapons drawn
>”You really didn’t see a trap coming? You seriously thought you’d just be able to waltz in here? You’re dumber than these normie idiots.”
>A spotlight shines into the parting fog
>And there, in the bright pool of artificial light, is Vanessa Doermuth, Lydia Penferth — the lioness — at her side
>Vanessa shrugs in her tight black jacket, a canvas tote bag in the crook of her elbow
>”Was this Mike’s idea to just waltz in here? Gah, what a dumb fuck. But people never change, I guess. I’m just disappointed that you’re here with them Anonymous. You’re smart. You ought to see reason.”
>Her voice booms over the speakers, and you guess that The Book of Wrath is somehow involved in that little vocal trick
>Lydia crosses her arms across her furred chest
>The light catches the many piercings that are stapled to her — in her lips, above her piercing eyes, hanging from her ears, the chain dangling from her pointed muzzle
>She stares hard, particularly at Mike
>Shaking, you answer back
“Where’s your little pet, Vanessa? Did it run away on you? You can’t do shit to us. Not while I have this.”
>Stupidly, you draw The Book of Rite out of your pocket and hold it up like a token of invincibility
>That was your second mistake
>Your first was asking about her ‘little pet.’
>The doe laughs
>”Pet? That depends — which one are you talking about?”
>Another stage light fires off, illuminating an empty spot next to Vanessa
>There’s a guttural snarl that echoes off the gym’s walls
>The Behemoth — all cloaked in pouring mist — flashes in next to Vanessa
>It’s nearly triple her size now
>It crouches low, as if ready to lunge forward at any moment
>Fuck
>You literally walked into thi-
>Another spotlight next to The Behemoth
>Christ what is this? A professional wrestling ma-
>Oh
>Oh no
>Oh no no no no no no
>”Hi ‘Nonny!”
>Standing in a clearing of the fog, underneath the yellow spotlight…
“Gloria?” You say in exasperation
>She looks… Actually the same as when you betrayed her
>Denim skirt down to her fucking ankles, crisp white blouse underneath a blue sweater, hands folded at her waist, horns polished to a high shine, innocent dimpled face
>Only… something ain’t right with the way she’s smiling
>You thought for sure there’d be fangs
>They wasted an opportunity to turn her into a vampire?
>Wack
“Wh-What are you doing with them?” You ask
>All the guilt of your betrayal comes crashing down on you like leaden weights
>”My new friends? Well, after you tricked me and used me for a dark ritual-” her cheerful smile widens “-I found out that, guess what, Vanessa was right!”
>The doe flashes you a knowing smirk
>”She’s right she’s right she’s right!” Gloria claps her hands together proudly. “I changed my ways, Anonymous. And you should too!”
“Changed your ways?” You turn to face Vanessa. “Whatever happened to people not changing?”
>Vanessa draws The Book of Wrath and a razor out of her canvas bag
>She approaches Gloria
>”Oh, don’t worry. People don’t change. Deep down at her core, she’s still a horrible, hypocritical, prissy little bitch. But we think she’s much nicer to be around as a slave.”
>Slave?
>With a christened smile, Gloria obediently rolls back her sleeve and holds out her wrist to Vanessa
>”One last chance to turn over the book and the bunny and join the winning side.” Vanessa pauses, the gleaming razor just inches from Gloria’s pure white wrists
>”Sam, Jenna, Anon… you’re all welcome to join us.” Lydia adds. “Except for you, Mike.”
>She flashes a toothy grin ”I want you all to myself.”
>”Hah, very scary you lanky cunt. Where’s your gaggle of fledglings?” Mike taunts
>”Oh, there’s here.” Lydia snaps her fingers
>The lights on you grow brighter, illuminating more of the gym
>The four of you are surrounded by no less than six cheerleaders — human and anthro — their eyes glowing red, bodies tight with strain and tension
>They look like hounds waiting for their master’s call to swarm their prey
>Mike brings his super soaker around the gym
>”I already told you, I ain’t joining you crazy bitches. You stole my goddamn future.” His fingers slip around the trigger. “So try something. I dare you.”
>”I’d love to, really baby.” Lydia steps forward-
>”WAIT!” Vanessa shrieks
>Silence as Lydia freezes in place
>”We haven’t heard from the leading ‘man’ yet. Anonymous? Spare your friends here? Give up the book and the bunny?”
>…
>You really can’t win this one
>And time is running out
>You’re outnumbered, outclassed and outdone…
>…That’s what the old you would have said
>But Vanessa’s wrong
>People DO change
>And you’re not a coward anymore, despite the shaking in your voice and the tension in your throat
“Get fucked you evil bitch.”
>Vanessa’s eyes harden
>”So be it,” she says 
>In one quick motion she slashes the razor across Gloria’s wrist
>A waterfall of blood spills out…
>…Which she catches on an open page of The Book of Wrath
>Gloria starts to shake and shudder
>She keels over in agony, dropping to her knees
>Her sweater and blouse rip at the back as her shape grows larger
>And taller by at least five feet more
>And bulkier (is swole the right word here?)
>Until her whole fuzzy body ripples with muscles and her clothing is but stray scraps adorning her white fur
>Heh, you can her tit-
>Her eyes glow bright red as they settle on you
>”’NONNY!” She growls
>Her voice is at least several octaves lower than it should be
>She stomps forward as the spotlights follow her
>”YOU BETRAYED ME, ‘NONNY.”
>Oh
>Well, fuck
>You shove The Book of Rite into your pocket
>Vanessa snaps The Book of Wrath shut. ”Be a good little girl and bring me the book and the bunny, okay Gloria?”
>But with the way Gloria is moving, you don’t think she intends to do anything except break your neck
>Vanessa doesn’t seem to care. She turns to Lydia
>”They’re all yours. Just don’t kill Sam.”
>The lioness roars with pride and snaps her fingers twice
>The cheerleaders snap to attention like trained soldier
>”Alright you cunts, have at ‘em. Just leave Mike.” She starts forward, parting the fog as she moves. “He’s mine.”

>All six cheerleaders converge in a single moment, most of them opting to leap forward like feral wolves
>”God, FINALLY.” Mike unloads a blast of holy water into the face of a pig cheerleader
>She makes a horrendous, high pitched squealing noise and crashes head-first into Mike
>Mike goes down hard with the anguished swine on top of him
>Still wearing her cheerleading uniform, she clutches at her face as steam pours from her sizzling flesh
>In the middle of pitched battle, you can’t help but smell… bacon
>Makes you kinda want breakfas-
>Suddenly you’re in the air as Gloria’s brawny fist wraps around your midsection and squeezes you like a stress toy 
>You swear you can hear something snapping
>”You’re lucky I’m so gentle ‘Nonny,” Gloria bellows
>Well given that you think she cracked a rib, you don’t think that’s entirely true
>The goat turns and starts walking you towards Vanessa, who waits with The Behemoth at her side
>You struggle and kick valiantly, but with your water pistol tucked safely in a belt loop beneath your robes (and really, it’s not like you could harm Gloria, of all people, with holy water) you’re defenseless
>Christ on a fucking cracker how did they already win? This is so unfair
>You turn around and peer over Gloria’s shoulder
>Mike and Jenna are back-to-back, fending off no less than five vampire cheerleaders by themselves, blasting holy water in wide sprays
>Jenna’s garlic necklace and bumblebee costume might keep her safe, but Mike is straight up raw dogging it
>You can see that even the tips of his fingers are starting to burn from stray splashes
>Well, everyone’s fucked now- wait, where’s Sam?
>There is no Sam right now, but there is Samurai Outlaw
>The hooded hero dashes in front of Gloria with her baseball bat drawn, bringing the hulking Goat to a halt
>Samurai Outlaw’s chest heaves — both with nerves and exhaustion
>From scared amber eyes, she peers up at you like a mountain climber might look up at a perilous summit 
>With curiosity, Gloria reaches for Samurai Outlaw, but the bun jumps out of the way
>”Sam?” Gloria asks, her voice deep as a canyon. “What are you doing?”
>Samurai Outlaw rips down her red bandana
>”S-S-S- GOD DAMNIT s-s-saving the world,” she yells, so that Gloria can hear her above the yowls and screams of the cheerleaders
>Gloria scowls
>”Only one person can save the world, and His name is Jesus Christ.”
>The goat sweeps her free arm at Samurai Outlaw, but the bunny propels herself upwards into the air
>Gloria’s meaty arm passes harmlessly underneath the rabbit, who stomps back onto the polished wooden floors with a massive *thud*
>”Heretic!” Gloria’s cry vibrates in the hollows of your chest
>She stomps her huge feet
>The whole gym seems to quake in sharp bursts
>Samurai Outlaw falls onto her ass, momentarily dazed
>Taking advantage of Samurai Outlaw’s temporary immobility, the goat lifts one massive foot to stomp the hero out like a bug
>But the bun is quick to scramble up to her feet and hop (heh) out of the way
>To add injury to insult, Samurai Outlaw grips her baseball bat tight, pulls it behind her shoulders, and swings for the fences…
>…Though Gloria’s leg happens to be in the way
>Maybe that was the point
>The bat collides with the goat’s shine bone, resonating with a mighty and metallic *THUNK*
>Your captor roars with pain
>Gloria keels over, eyes squeezed shut, her grip on you loosening
>Now’s your chance
>You start to pull and wriggle yourself free, feeling less like a worm on a hook and more like a fish in a loose net
>Samurai Outlaw swings with two more rapid bursts, the bat colliding into Gloria’s shin bone like a freight train
>And right as you get free and tumble onto the hard gym floor, Gloria kicks out her wounded leg, punting Samurai Outlaw across the gym
>She CRASHES into a table, knocking the whole thing over and falling limp
>But you’re okay
>Kind of
>The fall dazed you, but Gloria looks more stunned than you are, which is a blessing
>”God damnit you stupid mutt!” Vanessa cries. ”Grab him!”
>You turn to see Vanessa smacking The Behemoth, who cowers next to her
>What the fuck is this
>”Why won’t you do as I tell you!?” She screams
>The beast finally budges, its ephemeral ears folded backwards
>It takes slow, plodding steps towards you, like it was dodging land mines
>Why is it not lunging at you and attacking?
>What the fu-
>Ah
>You feel Gloria’s massive, gaudy crucifix against your chest
>That’s right. It’s afraid of it
>You breathe a sigh of relief
>The behemoth won’t get near you
>And Vanessa can’t use The Book of Wrath on you when you’ve got The Book of Rite with you
>All was going as well as it could
>Until you feel a dark shadow eclipse the spotlights now shining holes into you
>You look up
>Oh
>Well
>Fuck
>Vanessa looms over you, hands on her hips, the canvas bag with The Book of Wrath sticking out of it is resting on the gym’s floor
>Completely unattended
>Holy fuck
>Your eyes flick between Vanessa and the bag
>”I’ve gotta do everything myself,” Vanessa growls, her fangs boldly exposed
>You jump to your feet and throw a quick punch at Vanessa
>This time you’re not going to get your ass kic-
>The doe expertly catches the thrown fist and pushes it back, the look of boredom and annoyance on her face never crossing over into strain
>God, you must really be weak
>Or she’s juiced up with a curse?
>Whatever it is, she uses her new strength to her advantage…
>And belts you one in the face
>Actually, more like in the nose

>Bright lights fading to darkness
>Your vision explodes; white rods and cones
>You feel (and hear) bone crunching as the doe’s strained fist collides with your pathetic — now bloody — human nose
>And back you go, a few stumbles
>And yet you remain standing
>Even with your fists raised like a boxer
>Oh the things you learned from anime
>Blood gushes from your nose
>”That was a solid hit,” Vanessa cocks a pierced eyebrow. “How are you still standing?”
>You spit some accumulating blood out of your mouth
“Because I hate you.”
>You lunge forward and ACTUALLY manage to catch the doe by surprise
>You deal her a sucker punch in the gut
>She’s a lot bonier than you could have imagined
>She keels over with a massive *huff* as you push all the air out of her with your fist
>Fuck, gotchu, you bit-
>Venssa’s arm swings wide at your throat
>And it’s only dumb luck that you bend backwards
>And thank fuck that you did
>Because you catch the metallic glint of a razor blade flashing in the spotlight
>Just inches from your neck
>”Fuck,” Vanessa growls low
>Her eyes meet yours. “Lucky dodge.”
>You came just inches away from having your throat slashed open
>And all you can ask is:
”Who brings a razor to a fist fight?”
>”Yo, Vanessa!”
>A voice, faintly familiar-
>Awww fuck
>A spotlight lights another goth — Reese, that ghostly pale, black-haired goth boy — with-
>SHIT
>-With Sam slung over his shoulder
>Reese is standing by the door to the equipment room, ready to move
>Vanessa grins
>”Guess you lose this round, ‘’Nonny.’”
>The way she says it is most definitely mocking
>But you know why she’s choosing that name now
>The ground shakes
>Gloria roars behind you
>You spin and see the gigantic goat glaring down at you, her face red with pain after Sam(urai Outlaw) thwacked the shit out of her leg
>You try backing up a bit, but you know your efforts are in vain, as Vanessa is behind you by just a few feet
>Caught between a rock and a hard place?
>Guess you could always try… diplomacy?
“Gloria…” you start, not sure where you’re going to take this
>Fuck dude, you better think of something, because the only thing between you and certain death is the book that both Vanessa and Gloria want
>You hear a lion roar, right as you open your mouth
>All three of you look towards the source of the noise, and see Mike up in the air, hoisted above Lydia Penferth’s head like a trophy
>He swings a stubby arm at her valiantly, but can find no purchase with his free hand
>Jenna, on the other hand, is barricaded behind a few tables as the vampire cheerleaders press in on all sides
>She manages to drop one of them with her holy water pistol, but there are still four left
>And she only has so much ‘ammunition’ in the tank
>And Alex?
>Absolutely nowhere to be seen
>Maybe he’s still in the hall with Sylvia?
>Who fucking knows anymore
>Everything is fucked now
>Honestly, you should just give up the book at this point
>You came in with a shit plan and got dunked on
>But one thing first
>You turn back up to Gloria and try to find the judgmental (yet blindingly innocent) goat behind her angry eyes
>You hope she’s still in there somewhere, like some good girl piloting an out-of-control meat-mecha
“I’m sorry for lying to you on Tuesday and using you as a sacrifice. What happened to you is my fault.” 
>The hulking goat looks… wounded? Hurt?
>”W-What?” She stammers
“I said I’m sorry. This is all my fault.”
>She shakes her head and takes a hulking step backwards
>”’N-Nonny?” She huffs, conflict as plain on her face as the confusion. “What are you saying?”
>And then you do something that maybe you should not have done
>But it felt right at the time
>You unwind your (Gloria’s) crucifix from around your neck, piling up the gold chain and massive wooden cross into your palm
“This is yours. Remember what you said about people being capable of change? In the gym on Tuesday? You were right — and I’m trying to change. I’m sorry, for everything. I was a coward back then, and maybe I’m still a weak coward, but I’m trying to change because of you and all my friends.”
>The goat kneels down and, with delicacy and surgical precision, plucks the crucifix necklace from your palms
>She holds it up to the light while Vanessa looks on, astonished
>And then she fumes, “PEOPLE DON’T CHANGE, ANONYMOUS. GLORIA IS STILL MINE!”
>The black book in Vanessa’s hands
>Then a spill of blood
>And then Gloria, pained, clutches at her head again
>”I’m sorry ‘Nonny!” She cries as she swings her brawny fist at you
>You hit the gym floor and cover your head as her first glides right over you
>Well that was a good dodge, you think to yourself
>Thank fuck she’s so sl-
>You fail your perception check and are completely blindsided by The Behemoth who is now free to destroy you as it pleases
>The Book of Rite goes flying from your pocket onto the gym floor, where Vanessa retrieves it
>Into her canvas bag it goes
>”Good dog.” She claps her hands like a retarded seal
>”Vanessa!” Reese yells above the chaotic din. “We gotta go!”
>The doe looks between you, on the ground with her little pet above you, and then at Reese
>She looks disappointed that she won’t get to see you get mauled to death
>The Behemoth snarls in your face, as if waiting for Vanessa’s signal to eat your neck like jerky
>”Have at ‘em.” She flicks her wrist dismissively, turning her back and making for the equipment room with swift strides, tailing behind Reese who is carting an unconscious Sam over his shoulder
>You look up into the cold twisted face of The Behemoth, and though you can barely make out its shape, you know that behind the clouding, ephemeral shroud of smoke is a twisted mouth crowded by fangs
>And you know: time is running out
>When midnight rolls around, everything will be fucked
>And isn’t everything fucked now?
>And then something happens that you did not expect
>Both you and The Behemoth look over as the doors to the gym explode open
>The spotlights fly to the door, and everything stops, like all the air was sucked out of the room
>Sylvia is there, on all fours, frothing at the mouth her wild, psychotic eyes looking in all directions, but never at the same time
>She’s stark naked too, except for the heavy crystal earrings that she’s wearing
>And astride the feral badger, water pistol drawn…
>Oh god
>…Is Alex MOTHERFUCKING Mullen
>Gloria and The Behemoth orient themselves to face down the new threat
>Alex digs his heels into Sylvia
>She screeches with all the ferocity of someone so overloaded with conspiracy theories and alternative facts
>The mind-broken badger leaps forward, her sharp claws leaving scars against the polished gym floors
>Alex threads his hands into the shag of her fur, and braces for impact as The Behemoth tears off at Gloria and The Behemoth

>Alex, Sylvia, and The Behemoth collide in the air, tangling into each other with rabid ferocity, fur flying, claws and maws at each other’s throats
>Alex is quickly ejected from the battle and hurled forward

>You gasp as the sudden release of pressure on your chest opens up your lungs
>Your eyes instantly flick towards the open equipment room doors
>Now is your chance
>You throw yourself onto your feet, making sure you’re still armed with your water pistol and take one last look at Mike, who is still in a pitched battle with Lydia
>You two lock eyes for a quick second
>And he sees the open doors to the equipment room
>And then nods at you, as if to say ‘go’
>You nod back, turn on your heels, and tear off, lungs already burning, body aching all over from being beaten so badly already
>And you check your phone
>The time reads 11:30
>C’mon
>You will your body to move faster as you ascend the stairs behind the door in the equipment room
>Just a little faster

>You are Mike MOTHERFUCKING Sapone
>And-
>”Looking tired, baby.” Lydia snarls, so annoyingly cocksure
“Shut the FUCK UP, Jesus!”
>Blood runs down your clawed up arm and drips onto the floor
>You pump another blast of water at her, which she dodges with the fluidity of… well… water?
>She claws downward across your already burnt chest, shredding your jacket and shirt
>Three ribbons of blood blossom where her claws scarred your skin
>You wince, but issue a deafening blow with the butt of your super soaker, clapping Vanessa across the jaw
>The lion is dazed, but there’s not enough time for you to pump another round at her
>”Good hit baby, but you think that little bit of plastic is going to stop me?”
>She throws her head forward
>Her skull crashes into your skull
>Light flashes in your eyes
>Blood threads down from the top of your skull, blinding you
>And then you feel your nose crumple as a tight, closed fist collides with it, sending you to the floor and you onto your back
>There’s another explosion of salt and iron in your mouth as blood sprays from your nose
>You peek through the blood stinging your eyes and catch Lydia halfway in the air, her arms wide and ready to rip into your neck
>Oh god, you’re getting pounced on
>You roll
>Hop to your feet
>And blindly pump another spray of holy water at her…
>…Which catches her in the leg
>The minute the spray touches her JNCO jeans she starts roaring with anguish
>”Mike you cunt!” She screams. “My mom just bought me these!”
>She stumbles forward
>You frantically pump another spray at her, this time aiming for her head
>But thanks to the blood in your eyes, your shot only manages to melt her ears
>Hot steam POURS off the lioness as her flesh starts to disintegrate
>”I swear to fuck,” she growls, shambling forward, “this time I’m not going to miss.”
>She swipes you with her claws
>Weakly, you hoist your water gun in front of you in some pathetic attempt to keep her from cutting open your throat
>And contrary to her earlier dialogue, she misses
>Her claws rend your water gun in half, soaking her all over with the reserve tank of holy water
>Particularly in the face
>Some drops catch you on the hands
>It’s worse than boiling water — it’s like having your hands coated in molten metal
>And yet
>It’s exactly what you need
>Lydia collapses onto her knees, clawing desperately at her melting face…
>…Which is now shedding skin and fur like a coat
>Though your own hands are starting to burn and melt, you only managed to catch a few drops
>You can only watch through your blood-stung vision as Lydia’s face literally melts off, all her piercings sloughing away with the rest of her fur and skin
>Desperately she tries catching them in her paws
>It’s actually… pretty disgusting
>Still screaming and coughing blood, the bones of her snout now exposed, she tries mashing her melted fur and piercings onto her face
>It accomplishes little
>”MIKE HELP ME!” She cries
>”OH GOD HELP!”
“I-”
>Oh shit
>You might have actually killed someone
>You leap at her, unsure what to do, only knowing that you want to help
>The lion grabs you by the shoulders, choking and gagging
>Her claws dig into your skin
>”YOU STUPID ASSHOLE!” She gargles. “I’LL KILL YOU!” 
>She yanks you against her
>Her jaw falls open
>She pulls your neck into her mouth like you were a chew toy
>The horrible gagging noises and chortling fill your ears
>Your eyes instinctively slam shut
>You can’t believe you fucking fell for her bullshit pity move
>God DAMNIT
>Welp, you fought your hardest
>And your future is over anyway
>Time to die

>But the sharp pain never comes 
>Her grip on your shoulders relaxes…
>…As she falls backwards, face practically gone
>Holy shit
>Did she just…
>Is she…
>Dead?
>Breathing hard from the adrenaline, you look down at Lydia’s mutilated and ruined form
>Her face is practically skeletal
>Yep
>She’s gone

>Your brush with death is sudden death makes you appreciate the chaos of the gym right now
> The heavy spotlights now rapidly panning between Alex’s battle with The Behemoth and Gloria
>And Jenna, still fending off the vampires, dropping another one with a well-placed shot
>You cough hard and a spattering of crimson blood comes up onto your partially melted hands
>Fuck
>You’re a complete mess right now
>You can’t breathe through your nose
>Your vision is blurred
>You’re probably not thinking straight from that blow to your head
>Your arm is shredded
>Hands partially melted
>Chest bleeding
>Legs bloody and wounded
>You’re ruined
>And so is your life
>”Mike!” Jenna pokes her head out from behind her barricade
>”Get to Anon! We’ll hold them off!”
>Alex, who is fighting his own battle with The Behemoth, Sylvia and Gloria, concurs as he dodges a stomp from Gloria
>”GO COMRADE! ONE TIME FOR ALL TIME!”
>You just stare placidly, slack-jawed, not sure what Alex means, and especially not sure what you’re going to do next
>Is there still hope?
>The whole school rumbles as The Behemoth shrinks away from Sylvia’s flying claws
>It issues a challenging roar and leaps forward into the badger, rending her fur
>They’re right
>This is your chance
>You haven’t laid yourself to waste for nothing
>At the very least, you can get some revenge
>Putting all of your resolve and hatred into your quivering legs, you jog towards the equipment room doors
>As the sound of pitched battle explodes around you

>The ground shakes and trembles as if a switch was suddenly thrown 
>And your heart sinks when you realize what probably just happened
>…The ritual was set in motion

>The Behemoth raises its head to the ceiling and issues a triumphant, victorious roar, and then blinks out of existence
>The sound of raised car alarms fills the gym
>It must be in the parking lot now
>A bloody Sylvia flinches and skitters backwards at the sheer volume
>Even to your ears, it’s sharp like broken glass against your eardrums
>You don’t slow down
>You don’t look back
>You throw open the door leading up into the tunnels
>And dive right into the darkness

>You are Anonymous
>And you feel like crying
>Like, actually dropping to your knees in a terrible fit of anger and frustration
>You’re drenched in sweat and your body is badly bruised and beaten
>The ritual started
>The books are nowhere to be seen
>And neither is Sam or Vanessa
>You made it to the altar room, the one all scarred up with cryptic drawings and that burning ‘31’ etched onto the wall
>And the basin at the center of the room is filled with fresh blood
>Bunny blood
>In the ephemeral orange light of the room, you see a steady trail of blood leading your eyes across the room, back into the halls, and disappearing into the dark
>Standing between you and that trail of blood is Reese, a goth
>The guy who carried Sam up here
>He’s roughly your size, though pale as cream cheese. His blue lips look almost suffocated
>Black hair drips across his sweat-soaked face
“Outta my goddamn way, Reese,” you snarl at him. “I don’t have time for your bullshit right now.”
>”Pathetic mortal,” Reese scoffs, showing his bright vampire fangs. “I can’t let you past me. Turn around now.”
“Don’t give me that ‘pathetic mortal’ shit, you useful idiot. Step aside or I’m going through you.”
>”Sorry dude. Guess you’re just going to have to go through me.”
“Reese I swear to fucking G-”
>The vampire goth is too eager
>He leaps over the bloody altar, mouth wide open, ready to sink his fangs into your neck
>You move to the side easily as the useful idiot crashes clumsily into the wall behind you
>He turns to you with a growl
>”Heh, you’re fast, but I’m faster.”
>Actually you’re not fast
>That was the easiest dodge ever
“Nothing about that was fast at all, but nice try.”
>”I guess I’ll have to use… THAT…”
>What is this, a shitty anime?
>He lunges directly at you, catching you in the midsection and hurling you against a wall
>Okay, that one actually hurt, you think, as your body collides with the scarred up walls
“Why do you obnoxious cunts have to be so strong?” You rise to your feet, still shaking out the adrenaline and the pain in equal measures
>”Because we have been given the gift of speed and strength by our queen, Vanessa Doermuth.”
>You draw your water pistol from under your robes and level it at his chest
“Bet she didn’t make you immune to this.”
>”A water pistol? My queen will be most pl-”
>You spray him in the face
>”MOTHER FUCKER!” He shrieks, clawing at his cheeks and eyes
>The smell of melting skin makes your stomach churn, and you don’t like doing this, but my GOD is your body in pain
>You’d drown in morphine right now if you could
>So with anger you pull the trigger again and blast Reese in the crotch, melting away any chance he ever had of reproducing
>He collapses, legs kicking violently underneath him
“I told you, I don’t have time to put up with your shit right now.”
>You holster your water pistol in your a belt loop beneath your robes
>Every motion and movement fucking HURTS as you grunt your way into the dark hall, leaving Reese to turn to a pile of goth-goo and ashes
>You have one singular goal in mind as you follow the trail of blood into the dark:
>Find Sam

>The door to the rooftop shuts behind you as the raised wind batters it
>You stand on the rooftop, the night sky dominated by the moon
>And
>Standing as a shadow against the titanic moon, is Vanessa
>But you don’t care about that dumb hoe right now
>Your eyes quickly fall on Sam, who is unconscious near the roof’s edge, laying in a big heap of herself
>”You know, her blood is really useful. Plus Reese tells me she’s light as a feather. She’ll come in handy in the new world.”
“Reese is dead,” you say, taking a step forward, clenching your fists. “He’s melting right now next to the altar. Don’t you care?”
>The doe throws her head back and laughs
>The canvas bag dangles in her hands
>”You think that’s going to get me to drop everything and rush down there? Nope!” She laughs again, her bright fangs glistening with need. “Reese served his purpose. And so did you! Look at what you brought me!”
>She holds up the canvas bag
>”Like a good little idiot.”
>The sight of that bag is enough to make your heart start to race
>All you’d have to do is… somehow beat Vanessa and get both of those books back… and… grab Sam and… do it all before midnight rolls around
>Speaking of
>A quick glance at your phone
>It’s 11:40
>20 minutes until the end of the world

>”See that?” Vanessa points up at the red moon. “It’s almost time for the new world, Anonymous. Aren’t you excited?!”
>The moon is so close that you swear, if you were good and drunk, you might leap off this roof in an effort to grab onto it
>Bright flashes of memory come back to you in lightning bolts of clarity
>You can see yourself sitting next to Sam and Alex and Mike on the edge of the roof, chucking beers over the edge
>Bullshitting about lives you didn’t live
>You, hiding your cowardice, avoiding the big questions like college and what will become of your friendships after school is over
>Taking your anxiety out on Sam
>And Sam, still hiding who she is, covering her abuse and neglect with the oversized clothes and awkwardness
>Sam
>Who is now broken-legged and on the edge of the roof, one good shove from oblivion
>But Vanessa doesn’t seem to want to hurt her
>’She’ll come in handy in the new world.’
>What new world?
>You lurch forward, just a little bit, grunting as you put pressure onto your beaten joints
>Vanessa smiles as she sees you approaching
>”Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you’re coming towards me?”
>Ooh you hate her
“I’m not saying the lines,” you say through clenched teeth. “Now get over here so I can punch your lights out you evil bitch.”
>”Fair enough.”
>She darts forward, head down, eyes forward
>This anime bitc-
>She plants a strong right foot in front of her, cocks back her arm and swings into your stomach
>You manage to block it with your arms
>But the bone-shattering force of her hit forces a scream out of you
>You swear you’re seeing stars
>And she didn’t even have to blast you in the head
>Your arm rings and vibrates with pain, but you bring your leg up for a kick
>You’re no karate master, but you do manage to hit her in the side
>She winces with pain
>The ensuing psychotic smile she flashes makes you regret having kicked her
>And when she grabs onto your leg, leans back, and starts twirling you in a tight arc, you REALLY regret kicking her
>The world becomes a blur
>Colors and shape lose their meaning
>Everything is just a mishmash of everything, atomized and reduced to smears of motion
>Then everything snaps into focus as she releases her grasp on your leg
>You’re airborne now, sailing across the roof of the school like a human comet
>You skid back to earth, your back scraping on the grit and gravel of the rooftop
>When your body comes to a halt, you’re dangerously close to the edge of the roof, and dangerously close to being paralyzed by Vanessa
>Why?
>Because now she’s airborne and falling fast, her heavy black boots ready to smash your skull and grind your brain into a fine paste
>Splayed out on the gravel, it takes a good amount of your strength just to throw yourself out of the way of her killing blow
>She lands like she weighs 20 tons
>You feel the shock wave of her landing in your palms
>You climb to your feet and throw a quick jab at Vanessa
>Yet again, she catches your fist with little effort
>Still holding your fist in the air she sucker-punches you in the gut
>And there, on the rooftop, the final hope for humanity is brought low
>You seem to crumple around her fist
>All the air is forced out of your lungs as you drop to your knees
>You suck oxygen like earth was running out
>And who knows, in Vanessa’s new world, maybe that’s the case?
>Through all of this, that canvas bag is still in the crook of her elbow
>The two most important books in the world, and there they are, in a thin canvas fucking bag, right in front of you
>Shaking and badly bruised, you reach for the bag
>The doe laughs and bats your arm away like an annoying fly
>She all but punches your lights out with an unnaturally wild right cross that sends you skittering across the rooftop
>Your eyes snap shut, and you try to pretend that it’s not happening, which has been your strategy for everything in your life that scares you
>You try to pretend that none of this is real and that this is all some really bad teen movie, or that you’re trapped in some shitty dubbed anime
>But it’s real. It’s all real. Vanessa, the moon, Sam, Mike, Jenna, Alex, The Behemoth
>You’d rather get a slap to the face to wake you up, but you can’t choose how things happen
>Vanessa starts laughing in that really obnoxious laugh that’s made you hate her for so many years, and you want to tell her to shut the fuck up, but you can’t put your energy into words
>”Outnumbered, outclassed, outdone,” she lifts you easily in the air by the collar of your vestments and stares into your eyes. “And here I thought at least you and I could see common ground. I really thought you’d understand. And after all you’ve done for us, I was perfectly willing to let you live.”

>Well, here we are
>This same tired start where the story began
>You on the rooftop, the parking lot a total wreck, you close to death, and everything everywhere a complete and utter mess

>Vanessa’s lips curl up into a smile, and the fangs — which a doe definitely shouldn’t have — slide forward
>”Unlike people, I guess some things change.”
>You never thought it’d end like this. In all the fantasies you’ve had of your demise, death-by-doe was not one of them
>Your beaten head rolls back, like your neck was a noddle and your head a bowling ball
>You feel swollen all over, wet with blood and sweat
“You know, I think you’re right. People don’t change,” you say, struggling for breath
>Your gaze briefly flits to Sam’s crumpled body on the edge of the roof, and then back to Vanessa, who is staring so triumphantly back at you through darkening eyes
>”Little too late to fly a new flag there, Anon. You missed your chance to be on the winning side.”
“You didn’t let me finish.” You breathe hard. “I was going to say I always hated you. I still hate you. Even if I could understand where you were coming from, I’d still hate you. In some ways, people don’t change, because I will always, always hate you.” You take a shallow breath. “But you’re wrong about everything else.”
>Vanessa flashes a toothy grin, or some poor attempt at containing her fury — one of the two
>”Aww you’re cute, you know that? If I were into humans — scrawny cowards like you — I might think about making you some sort of concubine in the new world. But sadly…”
>She lifts you higher in the air like you’re some kind of rag doll
>”People just don’t change.”
>She cocks her arm back, and in one swift motion, hurls you with unbelievable force
>Your back slams against the hard metal door of the rooftop’s maintenance access entryway, a low, hunched over brick building jutting out from the roof
>You bounce forward, coming to rest against the door, all the air ejected from your lungs via concussive force
>You lurch forward and breathlessly gasp, propped upright by sheer luck
>You swear you physically felt yourself going concussed
>”You’ll be a coward forever!” She howls, starting forward, “Always creeping in the dark, always running from what threatens your peace. I know your type.”
>She towers over you with clenched fists, her blood moon shadow engulfing you entirely
>The sound of car alarms blaring draws both of your attention
>And then a terrible squealing noise that shakes the rooftop gravel, the sound of The Behemoth raging somewhere
>”Can you hear it? Maybe not with your pathetic human ears, but I can. It’s the sound of a human’s spirit breaking. Ooooh we’re so close now to the end now.” 
>She shivers, but not from the cold and biting wind. Her expression turns soft as she look down at your pathetic, writhing form
>“Seeing you like this, down and out, moments away from death, I can’t help but pity you just a little.”
“You don’t have pity,” you wheeze, still trying to recover from the glancing blow dealt to the back of your head (which you’re sure is starting to bleed now). “You only have anger and hate for people who couldn’t care less about you at all.”
>”You mean those SHEEP in the gym beneath us? Of course they don’t care. And that’s their crime. They’re self-absorbed, self-obsessed, normal, well-adjusted, happy, social and loving, and they always, always will be. You and I are different — that’s why I trusted you. It’s why I thought you’d understand what I had to do.”
>She leans in close
>”I wanted you to rule beside me, you stupid fucking coward. At least you know what it feels like not to belong.”
>Your vision is going fuzzy, but you’re still lucid enough to spit blood and curses
“Fuck you, Vanessa. Gloria was right this whole time. People can change. You’re just a sad, lonely doe who never got the message.” Blood and curses fly from your mouth
>Did you bite your tongue?
>Vanessa shrieks with laughter
>Real, horrible, rib sucking laughter
>”Oh Anon, how I wish that were true. Maybe you’d have seen our side of things… saw all these normalcunts for what they are: shallow and selfish. But it’s okay. I’m going to make everything better. We can all be equal in our madness as we tear this world apart, brick by rotten brick.”
>JESUS CHRIST she’s insane
>You thought she was just edgy and had gone too far, but no, she’s just insane
>And cocky too
>Villains
>Why do they always have to gloat?
>You might gloat too if you were her
>And you’re about to have reason to gloat
>Your hand sneaks beneath your robes, where you keep the water pistol tucked into a belt loop
“Some free advice, you crazy bitch:” you say, aiming the pistol upwards under your vestments. “don’t monologue.”
>Vanessa recognizes the shape of your holy water pistol beneath the robes all too late
>Triumphantly, you squeeze off a few shots that fly through the relatively thin fabric of your fake vestments
>Thank FUCK for cheap costumes
>They catch Vanessa once on the breast of her skin-tight black jacket
>And then again in the face, arms and legs
>It’s about as unceremonious as it gets — little streams of water pounding against Vanessa’s arms, legs, chest and face
>No concussive heat blast, no triumphant orange muzzle flash to herald her doom
>Just holy water in a cheap, 99-cent water pistol
>But it’s enough
>She flinches and winces as the streams of water strike her
>Wisps of steam and smoke trail off her as a bright scar appears where her skin and makeup begin to slough off from her face
>And yet beneath the searing flesh, you can see a hateful, devil’s grin
>Reminds you of Sam’s dad
>”Very clever you little CUNT.”
>You pull the trigger again — and you keep pulling it until her hand grips the water pistol and easily squeezes it into shards, sending plastic and holy water flying in all directions
>With skin and fur falling away from her hands, revealing tightly corded and magically cursed muscle beneath, she looks up at her now bloody and raw fist with morbid curiosity
>And then with contempt down at you
>”You’re still a coward…” she hisses through her fangs
>Oh god
>Her face is starting to peel and welt up
>Still winded from being hurled across the roof, you can do little more than struggle when she grips you by the collar and pulls you to your feet
>She pulls back her right arm like a pistol’s hammer being cocked back
>”…You brought a gun to a fist fight!”
>Her arm explodes forward and hits you so goddamn harm in the jaw that you don’t actually feel it
>You feel the blunt force of her bloody fist colliding with your jawbone, but the tremendous shock of pain that normally follows a finishing blow like that doesn’t come
>What gets you is the way your body collides with the door, head slamming backwards into the cold metal
>Now THAT hurt
>But at least she hit you hard enough to knock you from her grasp
>Dazed, you can see Vanessa pulling her bleeding fist back again for another killing blow
>And it happens in slow motion
>For once you’re grateful to have been belted one

>The way her arm pushes forward, a comet’s tail of fresh blood streaking off of her now boiling arm and chest and face…
>…The way the cars begin flying through the air haphazardly behind her, as if tossed by some gigantic child — but you know that’s the Behemoth’s work as it spreads its madness to the moon and stars…
>And it’s in this slow motion that you’re able to duck your head and roll onto your side
>The doe’s triumphant fist punches a hole in the door right in the space where your head used to be, all metal shredding inward like a flower’s petals opening
>You hit the ground hard, getting a face full of gravel and grime
>And maybe a few pebbles up the nose
>Vanessa rips her hand out of the door, the thin canvas bag dangling in the crook of her elbow
>She bellows a deep, scarred-throat shredding roar, as if she were full of hell itself
>But you hardly hear it
>Your eyes are fixed on something else: that swinging bag she’s carrying, so tantalizingly close

>Without thinking you reach out and-
>You get a black boot in the gut as Vanessa roars, the glint of madness long since swallowed by darkness and rage
>You can’t even see her pupils anymore — just black stones
>Sputtering blood from your mouth, your mind instinctively reels backwards in time, flying at the speed of a warm blood rush
>You just want to find a place in your memories that doesn’t hurt
>And maybe it’s because you’re on the rooftop again, but you can’t help but find yourself back in the same place you were last week near this time

>Friday night, one week ago you-
>Another stuttering kick in the gut and you’re sucking air
>-You were all on the rooftop drinking and-
>Your hands grope blindly against the side of the maintenance access entryway, feeling for something — anything to anchor you to reality
>-And you still had beers leftover and-
>You fight against the urge to vomit as the doe clutches you by the throat, your airways pinched off in a vice grip 
>She starts to hoist you in the air, face-to-face with her, spitting blood through her sharpened teeth, face peeling and sizzling, revealing a mask of muscle and raw skin beneath her velvety fur 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQwKWuTrlCY&list=PL9aXlzDRA49QKxgYsOV2JuDd410_nI-0J&index=22
>She shrieks in a voice not her own, “I WANNA SEE THE LIGHT LEAVE YOUR EYES!”
>>-The four of you elect to leave the rest of your beers on the roof, right next to the rooftop door, making plans to return again-
>Your searching fingers find the still full bottle against the side of the access tunnel and wrap around its neck 
>You feel Vanessa’s second hand cinch around your throat like a vice
>She lifts you in the air under her own strength, too fixed on your inevitable suffocation to notice the amber bottle dangling in your right hand
>Dark stars all around you
>Swarms of unconsciousness bleed in around the corners of your vision, stretching inward like ruthless vines
>You’re very still and limp as she chokes the life out of you, and you know: this is your time
>Sam isn’t moving over there on the ledge
>Jenna, Alex, Mike and Sylvia are still trapped in the gym
>She squeezes your airways shut
>She squeezes for everything she’s worth
>Everything she’s worked for and built
>Everything you’ve tried to undo
>And for what?
>What was it all for?
>For Sam
>For Alex
>For Jenna
>For Mike
>
>For something that matters
>You bring your arm up, the amber bottle shot through with red moonlight; like Excalibur ripped from the lake
>Vanessa’s eyes go up, settling on your weapon, its oblong shape reflected in her black pupils like a prophecy from beyond time
>With your last moments of consciousness, feeling her bloody fingers pressed tight against your skin, your grip tightens and…
>…you bring down your arm down in a hammer-stroke, the bottle crashing sharp against the top of her skull

>The bottle breaks into heavy shards and a spray of warm beer, leaving you with only its jagged neck as you fall from Vanessa’s grasp
>The doe throws her hands onto her head and screams
>You drop like a cinder block into a heap of blood and cheap costume fabric
>One last thing though
>With the last bit of lucidity you can still scrounge up from your brush with death, you swipe the sharp remnants of the bottle against the taut strap of her canvas bag with enough force to sheer the fabric
>It drops against the rooftop, spilling its contents — and the two books — everywhere

>You gasp and suck and sputter, struggling to put air back into your nearly-collapsed lungs
>The books are just feet away, while Vanessa stumbles backwards, blood cascading down her face from a now bright red gash on the top of her skull
>You’d reach for the books but… you just have nothing left in the tank
>She screams and shrieks horribly through the pain and…
>Fuck
>…Lunges towards you

>Well, this is all you can do, you guess
>You played your last card and you still couldn’t stop her
>You’re sorry to everyone you’ve let down
>Which is… literally everyone on earth
>But more importantly: 
>Sam, who risked everything for a better life
>For Alex who wanted to change the world
>For Jenna who… gave up her car?
>And for Mike, who ruined his entire life for you
>If he was here, you’d scream apologies, beg his forgiveness
>But he’s not
>You’re cold
>So very cold now
>Alone
>And ready to die

>The door to the roof flies open
>You weakly turn your head around and squint through your collapsing vision
>Standing there in the portal, breathing hard and gripping the frame like a life preserver in choppy seas…
>…Is the BIGGEST asshole you’ve ever met…
>Mike MOTHERFUCKING Sapone
>”You bitch,” he seethes
>He starts forward, and you notice his body is practically ruined
>No water gun
>MASSIVE bloody gashes running down his chest and arms and legs
>Blood from his forehead forcing one of his eyes shut
>Nose crooked
>Hands looking like they’ve been dipped in a vat of acid
>He rushes past you, almost like you’re not even there, suffocating on the ground
>”You stole my friend.”
>”You stole HIS boyfriend.” He jabs a finger at you
>He lunges through the air, intercepting Vanessa mid-sprint
>”You stole my future!”

>The pair tangle their limbs together, digging tooth and nail into one another, fighting to stay on their feet
>The first one to go down isn’t getting back up again, you know that
>Vanessa gives Mike a powerful shove, sending him clunk-footing backwards
>She follows up with a wild right that goes wide as Mike ducks it
>And watching him move, even all ragged and bloody, is like watching water slip around sharp rocks
>He comes up strong, exploding with an uppercut that knocks Vanessa a good inch or two into the air
>Though she lands on her back, the doe is far from done
>She swiftly rolls out of the way of another rage-guided fist, meant for her face, which explodes into the gravel
>And in an instant she’s back on her feet, breathing hard, her face a horrible, bloody mask of what she once was
>The Behemoth roars, shaking the entire school — hell, maybe even the earth, you don’t know
>Now is your chance
>The world is ringing. Everything starts to collapse around you — an avalanche of sensory data cascading in on you all at once:
>Mike and Vanessa, tangled up together, near the edge;
>Dark stars pulsing and receding in the fringes of your vision;
>The feel of the gravel and grit underneath you as you dig your fingers in and pull yourself across the rooftop;
>The hammering pain jumping and pulsing through your body, emanating from a bloody gash at the back of your head;
>Spinning nausea rising in your gut;
>Heart hammering like God Himself was pounding on your ribcage with a mallet;
>The sight of Sam aching to her feet;
>The panic that rises in you when you see Mike come away from Vanessa as a splattering of crimson is shot up against the moon;
>His shriek and Vanessa’s laughter against your ears;
>Everything, all at once:
>One time for all time

>Your right hand falls upon The Book of Wrath, its gritty black cover reflects the crimson light of the moon
>You flip it open to a page — any page — intent on one quick spell to knock Vanessa on her ass for good
>You look up 
>Mike stumbles backwards, away from the rooftop’s edge, clutching at his neck
>Your eyes widen as blood spills out between his fingers
>He makes horrible, ugly gurgling sounds as he bleeds profusely through the slash across his throat
>A razor gleams in the doe’s hands
>She turns to look at you, and even from a distance, you can see the proud smile on her face that says, ‘That’s for the bottle.’
>Mike drops to his knees
>But you can’t take your eyes off your best friend, who is sharing a look with you
>A desperate, wild look, one that says, ‘I’m scared to die,’ and ‘I don’t want to go.’
>But there’s something else there behind his bulging and panicked eyes 
>Another expression
>And it sends your heart plummeting when you lock eyes for the span of a heartbeat, because you know what he’s saying:
>’Goodbye.’

>No
>NO
“MIKE!” Your throat is raw, like you’ve been screaming with your head under scalding water
>You know what he has planned
>Mike, that asshole, rises to his feet, tottering on the edge of the roof where you once sat and threw beers at the city
>He releases his hold on his own neck, and blood comes cascading out like a dam bursting
>He needs both hands for this
>He needs Vanessa, who is striding forward, towards you, the razor gleaming in her hands
>”Now, your turn,” she says in your direction
>But she doesn’t get any further than a foot or two

>He wraps his tired arms around her waist and digs his feet back into the grit and gravel
>And starts dragging her backwards
>”Get the hell off me!” Vanessa throws an elbow at Mike
>But the distance to the edge is short, and he’s long since passed the stage of lucidity
>He’s just a body, hauling another body
>The last of what he has is wrapped around her waist
>All effort and pain and glory between his threaded fingers
>If Mike’s heart were anywhere else but his shuddering chest, it’d be between those fingers
>He stumbles backwards, hauling Vanessa’s struggling form towards the edge of the roof
>Now at the edge
>So close
>You scream again
“MIKE! YOU ASSHOLE!”
>He lets one foot slip off, his body suspended in purgatory, eyes to the sky, vacant and yet so full of moonlight you swear they’re glowing
>With one final effort he pulls Vanessa’s body tight against his own, takes another step backwards
>And then they’re gone

>You remain unreasonably still despite it all
>Everything has gone hauntingly quiet, save for the rush of blood pulsing through your veins
>That you are alive; you hear that loud and clear
>You just keep looking at the spot where Mike and Vanessa once were, as if they were going to reappear any second
>But they don’t. And the ground rumbles again with an otherworldly tremor again
>Your throat tightens up, reminiscent of the pain you felt when Vanessa was choking you out
>But this?
>This hurts more

>Your eyes instinctively flit towards some motion on the edge of the rooftop, just in the fringes of your vision
>It’s Sam, struggling to rise to her feet, wounded body trembling itself back into consciousness
>Sam
>It’s Sam
>WAIT
>IT’S SAM
>Suddenly you're on your feet, having collected the two books and an edge of the broken glass bottle
>”Sam!” You call, clutching at your head where the pain is the sharpest
>The little bunny can’t stand under her own power
>Your sprint across the rooftop
>It feels like you’re running the mile all over again
>Before you help Sam, you take a masochistic look over the edge of the roof

>Two bodies
>A pool of blood
>Still as the moonlight
>It’s a long way down, but you can see Mike’s eyes peacefully resting, his lips just slightly parted, almost as if he were sleeping and would never wake up again
>And Vanessa, that horrible bitch of a doe, looks shot through with surprise — eyes bulging, mouth agape
>But still and void, just like Mike

>Even though she’s pure hatred and evil, you can’t help but feel a little bit of sympathy for her and her ilk
>No
>Sympathy isn’t the right word
>What you feel is pity
>That mike had to die, so that you may live-
>”A-Anon, h-help me,” Sam wheezes
>She’s limping upwards on a badly wounded leg
>-You’re not going to waste his sacrifice
>You slip your shoulder underneath Sam’s arm and hoist the rabbit to her feet
>She nearly collapses against you as her leg gives out again
>”S-S-Sorry,” she says, wincing. “T-T-Think it might b-be b-broken.”
“It’s alright,” you say to her. “Just hold out a little bit longer.”
>You press the books and shard of glass against your breast and stare fixedly at the open door
>The one with the hole punched into it
>The one leading into the dark
>And towards the end

>You race through the darkened corridors of the maintenance tunnels
>Well, race isn’t the proper verb to use
>It’s more like a speedy hobble in the sticky heat
>But it’s progress, despite how blurry everything is
>And how blurry your thinking feels
>Curious
>That’s all it is to you
>Curious
>Certainly not concerning
>But you feel that worry like a shard of ice against your bare skin
>Pain hammers behind your eyes, and your body feels like broken glass
>But time is of the essence, as each labored step through the darkness drags you closer and closer to the altar
>Sam is breathing hard, and to be fair, you’re practically gulping air
>Christ it gets hot up here
>”A-A-Anon, I c-c-can smell blood…” Sam’s voice is a high whine. “I-It’s really st-strong.”
>Careful not to drop the books or the slip of glass, you feel the back of your head, and gasp when you feel how wet with fresh blood it is
>Christ
>”O-Oh God,” Sam shudders. “A-A-Are you al-alright?”
“Yes,” you lie through clenched teeth. “Just keep p-pushing forward. I think we’re almost t-there.”
>In truth the pain is like a millstone around your neck
>Your heavy head and bruised up body want to collapse into the heat, to lay down and succumb to everything
>Death is a warm blanket
>You won’t allow yourself that comfort
>Not yet

>The fire-light glow of the room calls to you like a torch in the dark
>At the end of the hall, you see orange light slanting around a sharp corner, reflecting off the old copper pipes
“I think we’re almost there,” you say as you two hobble into the light
>You try smiling at Sam, but a lancing arc if pain drills right down from your head to your feet
>You halt in place and grit your teeth, body trembling as little tremors rip through you
>”A-Anon-” Sam looks up and gasps. “Y-Your head!”
>You again feel the back of your skull
>Oh Christ
>There’s so much blood
>And what’s more, you can feel a terrific gash
>”A-Anon we need to s-s-s-stop,” Sam says as she slides out and away from you
“We can’t-” Another wave of nausea and pain. “-Not here, not now.”
>”J-Just take it easy a-a-alright?”
>Her voice is so distant as you check your phone
>11:57
>You hear is a dull buzzing sound, like a swarm of locusts in your ear
>Those dark stars are back in the corners of your vision, pulling further and further inward
>You gasp sharply when they cloud your vision completely, sending them back to your peripherals, the way that a shoreline recedes in the electrified minutes before a tsunami
>You can see it now, as the narrow hallway opens up into a low, familiar room
>Strange etching and carvings adorn the walls, with a flame-written ‘31’ glowing large and bright like a neon sign
>And in the center of the room: the stone basin, still a shallow pool of blood in it
>You throw your hands onto the basin’s rim for support as another wave of agony overwhelms you
>Your lungs feel like they can’t get enough air
>You gasp
>And gasp
>And gasp
>And gasp
>Until the color returns to the room, all orange and pink, but tinged at the edges with gray and black
>The books and the glass shards fall from your shaking hand
>”H-H-Here.” Sam scoops them up and hands them to you. “P-Please t-t-take them, y-y-you’re the only one w-w-who knows what to d-d-do.”
>She wrings her ears
>You allow the books to fall into the center of the altar, where they are promptly saturated by Sam’s old blood
>Fuck
>Fuckity fuck fuck
>With shaking hands you flip open The Book of Rite, searching for that page about banishing
>But Christ, everything is so blurry, and your heart is racing so fast
>”An-Anon, here.” Sam holds her wrist above the altar, her sleeves pushed down her thin arms
>In her right hand is the jagged slice of glass
>Sam locks eyes with you and nods
>”T-Tell me w-when.” She steadies her shaking voice
>Fresh blood
>It has to be fresh
>You’ve been staring at the pages for too long
>You blink away the dark stars as your blood soaked fingers leaf through the pages of The Book of Rite
>It’s here
>It’s… somewhere in the middle
>11:58

>God, wouldn’t it be poetic to die at exactly midnight?
>Your hands are trembling too bad
>You’ve lost too much blood
>You’re concussed
>So just give up the ghost
>The world goes gray
>And then starts to get a bit darker
>How you’re remaining upright is anyone’s guess
>11:59
>A delicate furry hand starts leafing through the pages in front of you
>And you can see on the pages that same, torturous, spidery scrawl
>An old type of cursive written in fragmented pen
>And Sam points to a heading that’s faded with age
>”I-Is this i-it?” She says
>You hear her voice, but she sounds like he’s yelling across a canyon
>You read the heading, eyes bouncing around the scrawled cursive
>’Banishment’
>A smile spreads across your face — a wild, delirious smile
>You look up at Sam
>That dumb bunny
>That stupid, amazing, lovable, dumb bunny
>Your mind shears into two, like a glacier being cleaved in half
>You’re not sure what you’re going to say next, but your mouth starts working anyway
>You nod towards her exposed wrist and the trembling shard of glass hovering just above delicate fur
“R-Remember, ac-across the s-street, not d-down the lane.”

>A quick slash
>Sam gasping, reflexively clutching at her wound
>A steady trickle of blood saturates the page
>Light explodes from the old pressed parchments
>You shut your eyes and exhale

>You’re whipped onto your ass by an other-worldly force
>You and Sam both go tumbling down (tumbling down) (tumbling down)
>The two books ascend into the air, dripping with blood as their pages spin and explode in fractals of light
>You can only watch with gaped maws as the world coalesces and then spreads apart right before your eyes
>The ground shakes beneath you as you struggle to stand upright 
>You are quickly cut down by a series of jarring tremors that are so violent you can feel them in your teeth
>So you just lay on your back
>Like a dying fish
>And watch as the world trembles and shakes as your vision collapses into stuttering pulses
>You’re wide awake
>You think
>You don’t know anymore
>Until Sam crawls on top of you
>And then you know you’re awake (or at least alive)
>Or was she always on top of you and now you’re just gaining consciousness?
>Your eyes struggle open
>You feel her delicate frame on top of your own, like a heavy feather pillow
>It feels like with her there, all the tremors stop
>The books fall uselessly into back onto the altar’s center
“Sam?” Your voice is weak and tinged with exhaustion. “W-Why are you laying on top of me?”
>You cough out some dust and grit
>”Y-Y-You were sh-shaking,” she answers back
>But when you look up, her eyes are filled with tears
>They streak and cut down her dirty fur in mirrored lines
>It’s almost kind of beautiful, in a weird way
“Stop crying you big baby,” you say, half-joking
>The rest of you isn’t sure what exactly you’re trying to say
>”A-A-A-And you’re st-still bleeding.”
>To your surprise, she throws her arms around your neck and dips her face against your chest
>You can feel another type of tremor:
>Sam, shaking against you with heavy relived sobs
>”I d-d-don’t want to l-l-lose you,” she cries. “G-G-God p-please be alright.”
>You open your mouth to speak, which feels like a monumental effort
>Like your jaw was weighted shut
>So you don’t talk
>Just let the waves of unconsciousness take you, like a small boat being carried out to sea, as your vision goes to gray
>Sam is talking again, but you can barely hear her
>She sits up and scrubs her eyes with the back of her sleeves
>She tries to put on a determined and strong face
>”D-D-Don’t m-move. I-I’m g-g-going to g-g-g-get help…”
>But when she meets your darkening eyes, her strong front shatters like a dam suddenly bursting
>”A-Anon-” she bites her lower lip and swallows the lump in her throat. “P-Please s-s-stay with me.”
>You’re trying
>You want to live
>Because, if nothing else, you have something you need to tell her
>”I-I l-love you s-s-s-so much.”
>Your mouth forms the words, but no sound comes out:
‘I love you too.’
>Sam spends a few more heartbeats staring into your eyes, before leans in, plants a faint kiss on your forehead, and then rolls off you
>She stands tall (or as tall as she can with a broken leg) and leans onto a carved up wall for support
>”I-I’ll b-b-be back, o-okay?”
>She doesn’t wait for you to respond, not only because you really can’t right now, but because there’s no time
>She hobbles off down the hall, out of the reach of the slowly declining light
>The world turns beneath you, as if you were balanced on a spinning top set in motion at the explosive dawn of the universe
>And with the last molecules of consciousness now buzzing around you like flies as entropy quashes all motion, a wave of sadness and despair washes over you
>It’s not that you’re afraid to die
>You’re just afraid to lose her
>You exhale

>Hell, even a few of the cheerleaders, color back in their skin, hug and embrace over the disintegrating bodies of their former squad mates
>If they remember anything, you can’t tell
“HEY!” You shout again with hoarse lungs
>And then
>Parting the crowds like Moses, is Gloria, barely dressed in a tablecloth
>And she’s leading Jenna and Alex and Sylvia
>”Sam!” Alex waves his arms frantically
>Relief nearly drops you to your knees in prostration and thanks
>That and the broken leg
“P-P-Please hurry.” You point a finger towards the not-so-hidden doorway, still wide open. “A-A-A-Anon is up there a-and he l-l-lost a lot of b-b-b-blood.”
>It’s times like these that make you hate your stutter even more
>”What the hell is that?” Sylvia says points towards the open door. “I’ve never seen that door before in my life.”
>Unlike Gloria, the badger hasn’t bothered to clothe herself
>Her wide, yet stacked body moves with slovenly grace as she pounds her feet towards the door
>…Followed by Alex and Jenna and Gloria
>You want to go with them
>You want to make sure he’s safe
>But you know you’ll never make it up the stairs again
>You’ve done all you can do
>And now you wait

>Be Anonymous
>Are you
>Flying?
>Yeah
>You’re ascending to heaven
>You feel weightless, bereft of any earthly tethers
>A leaf on the wind
“So… I… I’m dead?”
>A booming voice echoes back
>”You made it little buddy.”
>You dun did good this time around
>A warm smile spreads across your face
>Everything is dark
>It feels… good, to be dying
>It’s blissful, like a dream
>”You’re going to be alright.”
>Wat
>”ETA to the hospital?”
>No
>Wait
>You’re dead
>But you hear voices around you
>The whirring blades of a helicopter cutting through the air
>The slow trickle of blood piped into your arms through an IV
>”Give us 10 minutes and we’ll have him in ICU.”
>Your eyes creak open
>And are filled with sterile, surgical light
>A paramedic — a cheetah — leans over you
>Her whiskers and nose twitch as she sees you flirting with consciousness
>”HEY JOE! HE’S AWAKE!”
>’Joe’ answers back: “Right, I’m punching it.”
>Your internal gravity shifts forward as Joe indeed punches it
>Where are you?
>You roll your head
>Oh
>Oh fuck
>You’re in a helicopter, circling above the school
>You peer out the open door, vision pulsing as blood fills your sapped veins
>You can just make out the rooftop of the school
>And the four shapes on top of it, standing still with apprehension
>You shut your heavy eyes, stones on each lid
>Oblivion feels good
>So you should enjoy it while it lasts
>Because after this?
>There’s so much life to live

>You are Anonymous

>Warm air
>Blue skies of May
>Sunshine and the promise of summer
>Idle chatter and the nameless sounds of classic rock swell into a noisy current that sucks you down into its depths
>You’re sitting at a cheap card table in your backyard, next to Alex while relatives and neighbors you’ve never met drop by the table and congratulate you, tell you they knew you since you were only knee-height
>”God, kid, I can’t believe you used to climb the tree in my front yard,” Mr. Harris says, extending a hand to you
>Mr. Harris is a human, and meaner than his long, silvery hair let on
>He looks  like a retired art teacher, minus the glasses and the actual interest in teaching children anything other than that he found them obnoxious
“I remember I’d climb your tree and you’d spray me with the hose until I got down,” you say, taking his hand and shaking it
>Actually, you’re not even mad
>You just wanted to let him know you remember his indiscretions against a 9-year-old
>”Well,” Mr. Harris clears his throat and pulls at his collar. “Congratulations anyway. On graduating.”
“Thanks!” You say, still shaking his hand. “We’re glad you could come to Sam and I’s party.”
>”Oh, yeah. Sure,” he says, curiously eying the rabbit, who sits next to you, wearing her graduate cap
>It smushes her ears to the side, and if it hurts to have her ears bend that way, she doesn’t show it
>She cracks a shy smile and nods in appreciation at Mr. Harris
>”Congratulations to you too, Sam,” Mr. Harris says, with the kind of awkward distance that can only come from knowing a friend of a not-so-friend
“T-Thank you,” Sam says, folding her little hands into her lap
>When he’s gone, you plop back into your chair
>Alex nudges you with his shoulder
>”He seemed like a dick.”
“You have no idea. That guy used to call my mom and tell her I was harassing his daughter. She was like six years older than I was! All I was trying to do was get her to give my basketball back.”
>Sam giggles
>”I-I can’t picture y-y-you playing b-basketball.”
“Well, I’m not saying I was any good.” You tip the neck of a bottle of root beer back, the sticky sweet nectar filling your mouth with a slow trickle. “I hardly even played basketball. I’d just chuck it against the garage door a bunch. Drove my dad insane.”
>”M-Me and my b-brother used to r-r-race against c-cars in the neighborhood,” Sam offers
>”Did you beat any?” Alex turns his bottle up and takes a pull
>”O-Only when t-they didn’t know w-w-w-we were racing.”
“I’m not surprised. Rabbits are fast as fuck,” you add.
>More neighbors come by to congratulate you before Sam or Alex can respond
>This time it’s an anthro family
>Lynxes, from down the street
>You think you used to play with their son, but you’re not sure
>What was their name?
>”Hey Anon! Congrats on graduating!” The older, male lynx says
>He’s wearing a maroon polo that clashes against his gray-black fur and sharp yellow eyes
>They’re full of unrestricted joy
>You smile and stand to shake their hands, but your smile must have been a dead giveaway: you can’t remember who these people are
>Luckily the older woman to the right of the other lynx, seems to pick up on your confusion
>”You might not remember us,” she says, her voice gentle and smooth like a trickling stream. “The Jamisons? This is my husband George,” she pats him on the shoulder.
>”And this is my dead weigh- I mean, wife, Meredith,” George says
>They both giggle
>Fucking boomers
>”You used to play with our son Kyle, back in grade school,” George crosses his arms and assumes a relaxed slouch 
>So you were right to begin with
“Oh, right, Kyle!” You say, not remembering anything about Kyle other than the time you pulled his nubby tail and he bit you and then he had to go to a special school for a year
“How’s he doing now?”
>The family exchange… looks
>Oh you know those looks
>Discomfort
>Guess what you did either fucked him up for life or awakened something fucked up in him.
“Anyway, I hope he’s doing well,” you add, trying to salvage the conversation
>There’s a slight pause that only the chatter of the party fills
>”So, Anon,” the father starts, leaning on the table. “I hear you got a great STEM scholarship to Red Field. Congratulations on that.”
>It’s true
>You worked with Mr. Bolm, who helped you find some really great scholarship programs for you to apply to
>Only caveat is that you have to be in a STEM discipline
>Secretly, you were considering English
>Still, it wasn’t so bad. Red Field was a short drive from home — no more than an hour
>And it was a damn good school
>”It’s true,” Alex says, smiling. “Anon here is going to build space communism.”
>You can no longer tell if Alex is joking or being sincere
>Ever since October his cavalier attitude towards communism… changed
>He seemed more at peace with his surroundings, and less revolution-focused, though the notion still haunted him
>The father looks at Alex and smiles the smile of a man just trying to be polite
>”And you must be Sam,” he says. “Congratulations.”
>”No, my name is Alex,” Alex says. He points a finger at Sam who is watching the streamers — red and white, the colors of your school — dance among the branches of the trees. “Sam is the bunny.”
>”Oh…” George puts on a forced smile and extends his hand to Sam
>The bunny shakes it with a firm grip
>”T-T-Thanks, s-s-sir.”
>”And uhhh, Sam…? What are you doing after this?”
>Sam brightens
>”I-I-I’m going to Ran-Ranchview C-C-Community College,” she proudly declares
>And speech therapy
>Meredith plants her paws over her heart. “Oh that’s so great to hear. Our Kyle is planning on going there in the fall. Your family must be so proud.”
“We are,” you cut in, quickly. “We’re very proud of Sam for graduating.”
>Sam continues to brighten while the two anthros deflate
>”I-I-I’m studying a-a-art and animation. I’m g-g-going to do my m-masters at CAL ARTS.”
>The wind seems to shift
>And the conversation seems to turn awkward, but you don’t give a fuck whether or not the Meredith and George and their wacko son Kyle think Sam is part of your family
>You think it was that blow to the back of your head, maybe
>It released all inhibitions
>”Well,” George retracts his hand and wipes the sweat from Sam’s palms onto his pants. “That’s really nice to hear, Sam. Ah, look at you three.” He puffs up a bit. “Fine young men. You’ll be raising hell and chasing girls across campus.”
>”Ac-Actually I-I’m a w-w-woman,” Sam flashes a bright, innocent smile, one without any sort of ill-will for the well-meaning Jamisons
>Meredith looks… confused
>”Plus Sam and Anon are dating,” Alex says to nobody, in a short, disinterested puff
>Nobody ever asks him what he’s doing with his life
>Going to a good school on the west coast
>Studying political science
>”Nobody cares about Alex Mullen.” He throws his hands to the sky
>The Jamisons take cautious steps backwards
>Sam is a woman
>Anon is dating an anthro
>…Whatever the fuck is wrong with Alex
>It’s alll too much
>”W-Well, congratulations to the three of you. Really. Anon, Sam, we left you both cards in the kitchen. Okay? Have a good day!” George and Meredith turn tail (literally) and disappear into the crowd
>You’ve been awfully combative today
>You can’t help it
>You’re a bit anxious
“God, I know this is tradition, but I can’t wait for this to be over. There’s too many people I don’t know or remember.”
>”Nah man, don’t worry. It was the same way at my party. Cake big enough for me to sleep on, aunts and uncles from the east coast… I don’t get it. But the money is nice.”
“W-W-When do we ge-get to eat c-cake?” Sam stammers
>She’s already three root beers deep, you’re not sure she needs any more sugar
>You pretend not to hear her
>Alex will fill her in anyway
>You stare at the banner above your back porch as it sways with the soft breeze
>It reads: ‘Congratulations Anonymous & Sam!’
>The whole backyard is gilded in red and white
>Red and white streamers, tablecloths, napkins, cups, outfits, cake colors, gown colors
>It’s a lot to take in, and that’s just the decorations
>There were plenty of people, mixing and mingling and talking over the sounds of your dad’s belly laugh while he mans the grill, or the thrum of music coming from a portable speaker set up on the back porch
>Your mom plays hostess, the curls of her golden hair falling in her eyes as she throws her head back to laugh at a story about you wetting your pants in the third grade
>Everything is happening at once, dancing around you and Alex and Sam 
>There would have been four of you if Jenna could make it, but she was busy with parties of her own, and  getting set up at her fancy east coast school
>You, Alex and Sam trade a quick look as a drunken relative stumbles out the back door to a chorus of cheering
>Unspoken looks
>The language of friends
>Someone is missing from this table
>…
>”What an asshole,” Alex says, and you’re not sure if he’s talking about Mike or drunk uncle Richard
>Maybe both
>”I-I’ll d-d-drink to that,” Sam declares, knocking back another root beer
>You and Alex quietly follow her example
>You’re going to miss school, in a weird way
>Despite how easy it was after Halloween
>The school basically coasted you and the gang through school after they ruled Mike and Vanessa’s death as suicide
>It was all sympathies and As once the investigation got through
>People you never met coming up to you like they ever gave a shit in the first place to tell you ‘how sorry they were’
>And, actually, you felt that at least some of it was sincere
>So that didn’t bother you
>What bothered you most was the lack of something that felt like it was a part of you your whole life
>Like having a rebellious arm suddenly ripped off
>Sure it wouldn’t cooperate some of the time, but it was still your arm
>God damnit, you missed that cunt-for-brains
>You pull on your root beer in an effort to drown the lump in your throat
>”So, when do you ship out, Anon?” Alex says casually. “I’m out start of August.”
“Start of August? Jesus, that’s… three months!”
>Alex shrugs in his dress shirt and tie
>He kept the beanie on as a means of protest
>”Can’t be helped, comrade. I’ve gotta go get oriented out there on the coast and get ready to raise some hell.”
>God damnit
“I move in end of August,” you reply, still slightly angry that you’re losing a month of time with Alex
>”Wait, Sam, what are you doing when Anon’s gone?” Alex says
>Sam stares straight ahead, watching the banner sway in a warm breeze
>She seems… lost in something?
>You can guess what it might be
>Melancholy
>”A-A-Anon’s f-f-family is l-letting me stay with t-t-them f-f-for c-c-college-”
“PROVIDED I visit every couple of weeks,” you add in
>Your parents took to Sam almost instantly, overwhelming her with love and sweets
>Sam, of course, lost her shit and your ‘welcome party’ nearly put her back into the hospital (and this was after the hospital essentially had to reconstruct her shattered leg)
>She had been living with you since Halloween, and you’ve loved every minute of it
>”That’s a sweet deal. Anon’s mom makes a killer fucking omelet. My best sleepover memories are waking up to her cooking,” Alex says
“Yeah,” you say softly. “She does.”
>You were going to miss her omelets (mom-lets she’d sometimes call them)
>But the omelets are just a smoke screen, concealing what you’re really going to miss:
>Everyone and everything
>The bright glow of Ranchview in the night, like a jewel crowded with light
>The camaraderie
>Cruising your rustbucket under falling leaves
>Halloween decorations and birthdays and Christmases where you traded out Sam’s old hoodie for a sweater that nearly drowned her, but one that she hardly ever took off
>The familiarity and pace of life
>All shot to the moon on a strange and unfamiliar comet
>Alex rises from his chair and smooths out his shirt and slacks
>”So, hey, Anon, are you and Sam coming to the school tonight?”
>He looks like a fucking accountant, not a revolutionary
“Yeah, we’ll be there. You still want to go, Sam?”
>Sam nods, knocking her tassel into her face, where it swings like a pendulum
>”And don’t forget the beers,” Alex adds. “That’s the most important part.”
“Right, right. I’ll sneak a few from my dad.”
>Alex gives you an affirmative nod, and then another for Sam
>And then he doesn’t move
>Just stands there, unsure of what to do with his hands
>Fuck, when did things become awkward?
>It started getting this way when you found out you’d gotten a few major scholarships
>He scrubs the back of his skull with his palm
>”Sooo… guess I’ll see ya’ll tonight?”
“Sure thing man, at 11.”
>He throws a thumb towards the doors
>”Congratulations again, Anon, Sam. Sorry to abandon you both so soon. I’ve got some things to take care of at home.”
“No worries comrade. Go do what you gotta do.”
>”Right. Bye then.”
>He pushes through the crowd like a forceful beanpole and jumps on his thin bicycle
>With a few encouraging *dings* he’s riding down the street, towards home
>You lean back in your chair and sigh a deep, exhausted sigh from the pits of your stomach
>”W-W-What a-are we d-d-doing tonight?” Sam asks
>You flick her tassel, still hanging in front of her face
“We’re going back to school, remember?”
>”N-No.” 
“To see him?”
>”O-Oh, y-y-yeah. S-S-Sorry I f-f-forgot.”
“Don’t sweat it, Thumper.”

>Sometime around midnight, you’re climbing up the (fixed) ladder towards the roof, backpacks full of beer
>The shiny chrome ladder does not shake or groan when you grip it
>Which is reassuring
>Alex scrambles over the top of the roof
>Followed by Sam, and then you
>You point at the stooped access building
“So this is where we left the bottles last time.”
>”The ones you smashed Vanessa over the head with?”
“Yeah,” you say, looking for any amber shards that might still be left over. Wouldn’t that be something?
>Like a little fossil
>The clean light of a half-moon shines down on you, illuminating your search
>You don’t find anything
>Still…
>You draw a beer from your backpack and place it next to the access tunnels
>”Waste of a perfectly good beer,” Alex notes, still shouldering his alcohol-laden backpack
“You never know when someone might need this.” You put your hands on your hips
>Memories come flooding back
>Lots of memories of pain
>Of how badly your body was broken
>Doctors said you’d had a major concussion, several cracked ribs, and came so close to dying they were already calling your parents about funeral arrangements when you got to the ICU
>You shake your head, banishing the thoughts
>Though they’d always plague you, you could move on
>You could change, because people do change
>Just like Sam could change
>”G-G-Guys, can I h-have my Dr. Bepper now?” Sam asks, feet swinging off the edge of the rooftop
>Well… some things don’t change
>You and Alex sit next to her
>She quickly grabs the soda from your hands as you pass it to her, and cracks it open with a noisy hiss
>You take her free hand and squeeze it affectionately, passing a smile between you two
>Alex doesn’t seem to mind or care
>He’s got plenty to drink
>And there’s an empty spot next to him which has been hounding at his attention
>An absence, filled only by the unopened beer bottle that Alex places there on the rooftop
>The three of you stare at it, like it was about to start speaking
>And hopefully if it does, it’d sound like Mike
>But you hear nothing from the tongues of the nether
>Just crickets chirping up
>The sound of hearty swallows of beer
>And then Alex belching
>”Ah shit,” he says. “I needed this.”
“Same here. After today I just need to be with a few very important people right now.”
>Sam squeezes your hand
>Finished, Alex chucks his bottle off the rooftop, at the city
>You shrug and let yours fly into the darkness, where it shatters somewhere below on the black top
>”Y-Y-Y-You know s-s-some has to c-clean that u-up,” Sam remarks
>Must be the leftover janitorial training
>”True. But this is tradition,” Alex says
“Yeah, Thumper.” You playfully nudge her with your elbow. “Your turn.”
>Taking one last look at her can of Dr. Bepper, Sam shrugs and chucks her can over the edge
>It speeds away into the darkness with surprising velocity
>Like a red and silver comet
>”You SURE you never played baseball?” Alex remarks
>Sam shakes her head
>”No. J-Just good at pe-petty crimes.”
“Brother?”
>She nods and smiles
>You’re glad she’s made peace with that part of her life
>Or she seems to have
>You all seem to have made peace with yourselves in one way or another
>”Listen,” Alex says, to the city, to you, to the sky, spangled with signs and stars
>”I’m going away for awhile. A long while. But I don’t want to lose touch with any of you guys.”
“It’s not like we’re going overseas,” you remark
>But you feel an ache in your chest and a  budding tightness in your throat
>Maybe you would lose touch?
>Maybe, like most high school friends do, you’d grow apart?
>”Well, even if we do drift in different directions, I want you to remember this spot.”
>Draining his beer, Alex throws another bottle off the ledge, already good and drunk
“Not sure I’m ever going to forget the place where I nearly died.”
>”S-S-Same,” Sam adds
>”And the place where we lost our friend,” Alex says
>Silence
>Not awkward silence, but a longing
>Memories replaying against the night sky
>Collections of stories unpublished, lives unlived
>Potential unrealized
>All we are is a collection of stories, and broken pieces strung together by friends and family
>Losing Mike was like having an important page ripped out of your favorite book
>Or like losing your brother
>Sitting there, on the rooftop on a warm night in May, you remember something you told Sam many months ago:
>>“An old friend of mine used to say you get two families: the one you’re born into, and the one that you make.”
>Christ
>You big softy. You really are going to start crying
>You don’t feel the need to hide your emotions around the family that you made, but you still can’t help but pound down your beer
>Gotta drink that melancholy into submission
“Of course we’re not going to forget this place,” you say, unable to stop your mouth from moving. “And you guys- how the hell could I forget you faggots?”
>”You better fucking not, that’s all I’m saying,” Alex says
“Sam, least of all. I’m not going to forget you. You’re crashing in my house.”
>The little bunny is speechless, but not because she’s been insulted or blindsided like the last time you were all on this rooftop drinking together
>But because she’s looking for the right words to say
>You wipe the tears out of your eyes
>Ahh fuck
>You hate crying, but it feels good up here
>To be crying with the friends you’ve called family
>”I-I won-won’t forget-” she starts, and then pauses
>”Forget what?” Alex says, setting his beer down on the ledge
>Sam stares at her next can of Dr. Bepper, reading the label
>Studying it
>In the darkness crickets chirp in a steady, organic metronome
>And when she’s finally found those words, she turns her amber eyes to the moon, letting the light fill her and trace her in a glow
>She’s ready with her answer
>And it’s the only answer you need to or want to hear, one that surmises everything that you’ve done or felt and said
>You swallow hard and point your eyes upwards to the same moon that Sam is looking at
>”S-Something that m-matters.”
