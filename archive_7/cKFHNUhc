Gamer-oo [Kangaroo; Gaming, Shyness]: The best way to a kangaroo's heart is through her gaming console, as one Anon has to learn to get her to open up more.

>You may like video games, but it’s nothing compared to Marsu’s obsession
>The red kangaroo’s apartment is wall-to-wall game cases, boxes, and memorabilia, with some impressively rare findings
>She’s not just a collector, but also pretty good at them to boot
>Growing up with several brothers meant she always had someone to play with
>But as she got older and moved out she began to isolate herself
>You’ve always been good friends, so when one of her brothers asked you to get her to be more social you knew you couldn’t leave her all alone
>Of course, this meant getting through to her using the thing she loves most
>You’ve gone to spectate at local competitions for her
>You’ve waited in lines for midnight releases with her
>You’re always her go-to partner for multiplayer games
>At first you were a little worried she was just seeing you as a training target or a body to hold her spot in lines
>After a while you started to think she might actually enjoy your company
>”Anon! Whatareyoudoingtomorrow?” she shouted into your ear during a phone call
>Probably hanging out with her
>”EEEE-GREAT! The new Rumble Mates comes out tomorrow, and I want to do the co-op campaign with you! It’s my favorite series!”
>Guess you better get an early night’s sleep

>Marsu’s ready to play the moment you arrive at her place
>She had raced over to the game store the second it opened to pick up her reservation, knowing you probably wouldn’t be so eager to join her so early
>”Hey”, she says breathlessly as you make your way to her “battle station”
>You do a double take when you first see her
>She’s wearing a pretty small hooded sweatshirt and loose shorts, but her gut is bulging out obscenely
>It takes a moment for you to notice she’s just using her pouch to carry all the snacks and drinks she isn’t able to carry in her arms
>She unloads everything next to the couch and hands you your controller
>It basically is “your” controller, because even though she bought it herself she got it just for you to use
>”A little something for my number one ‘player two’!” Marsu said with a smile when she handed you the package
>[RUMBLE MATES]!
>Marsu is bouncing in her seat anxiously
>You don’t know too much about Rumble Mates, but true to her word it definitely looks like the kangaroo’s favorite series
>It dominates the motif of the room, with more posters and figurines than any other two games combined
>”I’ll be Chrome Wolf, and you can be Knight Lion,” she says
>You’ve long since learned to let Marsu call the shots when it comes to playing with her
>You each take your respective heroine and the game starts to load
>It’s hard to tell if the loud humming is coming from the console or her
>The characters jump onto the screen and Marsu squeals in anticipation
>It’s a pretty bog-standard beat ‘em up, though Rumble Mates has always been known for being difficult
>Very difficult
>Marsu tries explaining all the advanced moves she knows from the series in rapid secession
>”...And if you have baddies in the 180-degree arc behind you BUT we’re both facing each other with enough Energy for at least a first level Super Stunt...”
>You never get to apply this knowledge since she cleans up all the bad guys on the screen before you can hit anything
>Your skill slowly improves, but you still get the impression Marsu has to carry you
>She scowls when you do something fatal for both characters
>And when your Lion Knight is the only one left you can see her look at your controller longingly
>You ask if maybe she’d be better off doing the solo mode while you just watch her
>”What? No! The heart of Rumble Mates is in the co-op!”
>Her long ears fold back in shame
>”I’m sorry, Anon. I didn’t mean to be so pushy. Please, you’ll get better!”
>Well, at least she’s not yanking the controller out of your hands yet
>Marsu calms down a bit, and the lower tension actually makes things go smoother
>The two of you get into a steady rhythm, overcoming the game’s increasingly harder challenges
>You scarf down food during cutscenes or loading times, building a small pile of bags and wrappers on the carpet
>Bathroom breaks only come when a major chapter is over
>You have to time your trips with Marsu’s, though, since she is too absorbed in the game to care much about her own bladder, let alone yours.
>After a few hours you hear a loud chirping noise coming from the kangaroo’s phone
>She glances at it with a whine, but continues playing
>Must not be that important of a call?
>”No, it’s...I’ll explain in a sec.”
>It takes a little longer than “a sec” to beat the next key boss battle, but when it’s over Marsu puts down her controller
>”Do you want to come with me for a quick walk?”
>You’re a little surprised by her sudden lack of attention for the game
>But as you stretch your stiff muscles the chance for a walk sounds wonderful

>The walk is more like a brisk jog (or hop), so it seems that Marsu’s definitely eager to play the game some more
>Honestly you’re amazed she didn’t want to just power through the whole thing in one sitting
>”They say you should take a break after every hour of play,” she says as if reciting a script
>The kangaroo sighs heavily
>”A few years ago I had to go to the emergency room because I passed out from exhaustion after playing a day straight. My parents threatened to take everything away from me unless I promised to take frequent breaks. I still probably don’t get nearly enough exercise...”
>After a few minutes, she slows down her pace a bit
>”You know, I always feel obligated to take these walks, but...it’s kind of nice to have you with me, Anon.”
>You feel the same way with her
>Seems you’re also making some headway in getting her to open up more
>Marsu looks to her pouch and fishes around in it
>She pulls out a granola bar in shock
>”O-oh, that’s embarrassing,” she says sheepishly, thrusting the snack into her sweatshirt pocket. “I thought I cleaned everything out.”
>You suppose it’s natural for even anthros to feel self-conscious about their own biological quirks
>Must be pretty nice to have a pouch like that, though
>”Yeah, it’s super useful. I mean, when you’re not needing it to hold little joeys or anything.”
>The two of you circle back around and start heading toward her place again
>”Heh, you know how some humans and anthros stretch their ears out? There are kangaroos who do that to their pouches. Pretty crazy, huh?”
>She tugs at her own as though she were snapping a waistband
>”You could fit a grown adult in there like that. Imagine if I could carry you around on walks, or wrap you up like a blanket.”
>Marsu stumbles over at her own words
>”I-I mean, not YOU specifically, but just...hypothetically, you know? H-ha ha…”
>She goes quiet for the rest of the walk

>Marsu is back on the couch with a single bound
>Getting some fresh air certainly helped clear your mind from stress
>It also made you aware of the funk from sweat and food litter everywhere
>The kangaroo probably has a tolerance to this kind of thing
>The game continues getting more difficult, but once you learn each other’s strengths you get into a synchronous groove
>It also means you start messing with each other a little more
>”Hey! You didn’t need the health pack! You have a freaking LANCE, and I have to get up there with a claw!”
>You pull the, “I don’t know how to play” card, and that sets her off even more
>”No, stop! Cut it out!”
>She’s too preoccupied to grab your controller, so instead she uses her feet
>A large paw is shoved into your face as she tries to distract you
>It works, but more from the tickle of her furry toes than from having your vision obstructed
>Even when you aren’t at each other’s throats anymore, Marsu keeps her leg up on you in a trance
>It can’t be that comfortable for her, right?
>You almost want to take a peek now that her shorts have ridden up a bit
>You know she’d sooner chastise you for taking your eyes off the game than sneaking a look at her underwear
>Or lack thereof
>The end is in sight, and it’s obvious you’re nearing the final boss
>You try to take a swig of your drink, but Marsu’s leg drops at the worst possible moment
>She knocks it out of your hand and soon your side of the couch is soaked
>”Crap!” she says. “I’m so sorry!”
>You look around for some napkins or towels, but she points urgently at the screen
>”No time, I’ll just clean it up later!”
>You still need some place to sit
>The floor?
>”No, wait, it’s too gross to sit down there!”
>She’s not wrong; you two kind of made the floor disappear under all the junk food
>”Um, uh...here, just sit here!”
>The kangaroo scoots back in her seat as far as she can, leaving you some room to sit down
>On her lap
>Knowing Marsu, she’s dead serious about it
>Whatever it takes to save the world, right?
>You take your position and Marsu wraps her arms around you so she can still hold her controller, looking over your shoulder
>It’s the ultimate showdown, and as much as you’re trying to focus on the boss battle you’re too aware of the senses around you
>The vibration of the controllers, Marsu’s deep breathing on your neck…
>Your goal extends beyond just beating the game
>You want to impress her, to make her happy
>When it all comes down to you to deliver the final blow, she’s leaning into your back
>You can feel her heartbeat
>And you don’t even realize you’ve won by the time she drops her controller and gives you a spine-crushing victory hug
>”We did it!”
>Marsu’s rocking you side to side
>The ending credits go largely ignored, until they end unceremoniously
>”So, that’s it...” she says dejectedly. “We beat the whole thing in a single day.”
>You can’t see her face from the way you’re sitting, but you imagine it’s full of disappointment
>”I thought it would last longer. I...really wanted it to. I was looking forward to this day for a while now.”
>You try to twist your head, but there’s only so far it can go with her muzzle stopping you
>”I just wanted to spend the whole day with you, Anon.”
>It’s already mid afternoon, you still thought the two of you would be playing late into the night
>You put one hand over her interlocking arms and the other on her sturdy thigh
>That’s all the encouragement she needs to turn you around and plant her lips on yours
>She’s still an awkward, nerdy ‘roo at heart, but even her inexperienced kisses are full of the same drive as any game she plays
>She gives little squeaks as she digs into your mouth, but it’s endearing to listen to
>The two of you pull away with a little embarrassment, but also relief
>Now you know what kind of feelings she really has for you
>And already you can feel the years of isolation break away
>”Um, Anon.”
>Marsu shifts her legs around, hanging them off the couch
>”Maybe we can go for another walk? And...”
>She takes your hand and slowly brings it back
>To her pouch
>”I know we’ve been on the couch all day, but when we can back maybe we can try something different...”
>Your hand slides into her stomach fold, and then…
>Hits something hard and plastic?
>”Maybe we could watch a movie instead!”
>You pull out the DVD case
>[Rumble Mates: THE MOVIE]
>Wow
>What a nerd



[[ Gamer-oo Two ]]

>With a little coaxing, you’ve finally managed to get your red kangaroo gamer girlfriend Marsu out of the house more often
>A chance to go to new places and try new things
>Predictably, she just wants to go and play games
>So the two of you are heading to Buck and Blaster’s for a day of arcade fun
>At the very least it has a variety of interactive and physical games to get her off her (cute) butt and be more active
>It seems cruel to push her like that, but it’s also entirely her idea
>She has good intentions, just not the willpower to act on them yet
>She has admitted several times she needs more exercise, and you’re willing to help her out
>Even if that means taking VERY small steps to get her there
>The place is just as much of a bar and restaurant as it is an arcade
>The beeps and chimes of the game machines mix with the rowdy merriment of the diners
>This is Marsu’s element
>She’s hopping on her heels in excitement as you pay for your cover fees
>It’s a good thing you had a filling lunch, because it’s obvious the kangaroo isn’t going to sit and eat until she gets some entertainment in first
>It’s so overwhelming she can’t even decide what to start with first
>When she does, it isn’t even a game
>It’s the prize counter
>Hunting for the perfect trophy and making a goal to get it 
>Sitting on the top shelf is a small all-in-one game console, preloaded with an assortment of classic games
>Her eyes sparkle and her mouth hangs open
>”That!” she squeals. “That’s what I’m working for!”
>Why that?
>Marsu already owns the real copies of all those included games
>Multiple copies, too
>”B-but…this is more compact! And it’s a collector’s item!”
>Alright, whatever
>It’s only...400,000 tickets!?
>”I’m already almost halfway there!” she says, stifling a whine and holding up a plastic card stamped with the Buck and Blaster’s logo
>You’re a little concerned how long it took her to even get “almost halfway”
>”Well…if we, um, pool our tickets it’ll go faster. And we’ll share it anyway!”
>It still seems like a bit of a waste
>But as long as she has something to motivate her, then you’ll throw your earnings in as well to help her get it
>Marsu lunges forward and pulls you into a hug
>She’s acting like you already won the game system
>”It’s as good as ours!” she laughs
>She skips over to a reload machine and slips some money inside
>The number of bills she puts in makes you even more worried now
>When she returns to you she thrusts a plastic card into your chest
>”Don’t lose this,” she says sternly
>Yikes
>Her expression softens back to her eager cheer
>”What are we waiting for? Let’s go!”

>Marsu drags you around the arcade as she analyzes the machines
>Many of them display their current “jackpot” payouts and she’s on the prowl for the biggest winners
>Unfortunately, many of the games are already filled up
>The kangaroo girl makes frustrated noises as she tries to find a vacant game
>”Let’s start with that one!”
>It’s a simple light game; stop the lights on the right bulb to win big
>The jackpot is up to a few hundred, which doesn’t seem all that impressive considering how far you have to go
>”Yeah, but this will be a fast win,” Marsu says. “I’m great at these! You’ll win almost every time once you have the technique down…”
>She slams the butter down, just one bulb shy of the jackpot
>A few pity tickets spit out
>”Just a warm-up…”
>She slides her card in to pay more credits and hits the button again
>And again
>5 tickets
>4 tickets
>4 tickets
>2 tickets…
>Every time she tries, she gets a little angrier and a little worse
>”Crap it all!” she pouts. “Why don’t you try it?”
>Now you’re almost afraid what will happen if you win instead of her
>”Use your fingertips, not your palm. The light is slightly behind the computer trigger, so it’s better to hit it too soon rather than too la—“
>*WHOOP WHOOP WHOOP*
>First try
>The machine flashes wildly as the stream of tickets pours out
>Ooh, she doesn’t look happy
>Marsu grabs you tightly, rubbing her body against yours
>A…victory hug?
>”I’m taking back the good luck I accidently gave you,” she mutters
>When the tickets stop coming out you grab them and begin to hastily fold them into a neat little stack
>Marsu rips off a chunk from your stream
>”That’s going to take forever!”
>She lifts up her sweatshirt far enough for you to see her bare stomach
>Then she stuffs the tickets into her pouch and gives them a pat for safekeeping
>Guess she can hang onto them for the both of you
>There are still more light games with some respectable jackpots, and you make your rounds harvesting them all
>Marsu manages to score the big wins more often than you now
>She sticks her tongue out with each victory
>Wasn’t this supposed to be a joint effort?
>”These are still GAMES, duh. There has to be a winner, after all!”
>Good lord, this is Rumble Mates all over again
>Speaking of which, Marsu eyes an arcade cabinet for her favorite game series lined up among other “legacy machines”
>”Anon! How about a few quick levels?”
>You have to remind the kangaroo what your mission is
>These types of games don’t even give out tickets
>Marsu tugs on her ears
>”Ooohhh, fine.”
>She looks around and another old machine catches her eye
>Before you can stop her, she’s already bounding over to it in large paces
>”I remember this one!” she gasps
>It’s a simple whack-a-dino game
>The mallet looks pretty badly damaged, and one of the dinosaur heads can’t go back down the hole all the way
>”My dad was a pro at this one. He could get the high score with a slice of pizza in the other hand! Then he’d put me on top and I’d stomp on all the dinos with my feet!”
>No wonder they look broken
>Marsu swipes her card to load on the credits
>Up pop the dinos, and down comes the mallet
>Her efforts seem to be held back by some childhood nostalgia
>Rather than fast, calculated motions she’s flailing around like crazy
>She does a little jump each time she strikes a dino
>Her total is nowhere near the high score after the last dino burrows back down
>Only a short strip of tickets comes out
>Marsu gives you an embarrassed look as she tucks them into her pouch
>”Maybe we should find some other games to play…”

>It’s hard to keep Marsu from getting sidetracked
>She keeps gravitating back to the high-risk, low-payout games
>Skee ball, roulette, button-tapping games…
>You’re never going to get all the tickets you need at this rate
>But after a while you realize something
>She’s having fun, and that’s what you came here for
>Getting that game system was technically HER goal, but you’ve been more focused on it than she has
>You already met your own goal by getting her out of the house
>”Anon, we have to try it!”
>Your gaze follows where she’s pointing: a “Stompin’ Beat Beat” machine
>Arrows on the floor glow invitingly
>Again, no prize tickets for playing this sort of thing
>But at least it’ll be good exercise
>”I got in pretty good shape when I was younger playing SBB,” Marsu says, wiggling her hips
>That’s one way to get fit, you guess
>Marsu puts a paw on her belly
>”Yeah, I...was kind of a chubby kid. Getting a workout from the arcades was easier than going to a gym. Not as many people to judge you...”
>She swipes her card and the playlist scrolls by
>There’s a lot of music you’ve never heard of
>That’s not the case for Marsu
>She oohs and ahhs with each press of the button
>Finally she settles on some obscure pop group and picks her difficulty
>It’s a bit higher than what you pick
>You’re not even sure her difficulty is possible for a human’s anatomy
>Marsu zips herself up to keep everything in her pouch from flying all around, then hops in place for the countdown
>The game starts, and the screen is flooded with arrows
>At least on half the screen
>You can still see the background as your cluster of arrows fly upward, while Marsu’s side is completely filled
>Her long legs thump furiously on the platform, hitting each arrow flawlessly
>It’s a little distracting, and most of the challenge for you comes from trying to drown out her commotion
>A few times you feel a gush of wind as the kangaroo’s tail whips by
>You dodge out of the way just as a powerful swipe nearly takes out your legs
>The music subsides and the last arrow floats off
>That…could have gone better
>Your failing score kicks you out of the next round while Marsu takes the center of the platform
>”You did…h-hah…you did good,” she pants. “Now let me…let me show you how it’s done!”
>The next round begins and the screen fills up with arrows once more
>This time, Marsu’s tackling both sides at once
>Dancing and grooving with expert precision
>An audience starts to form around you to watch Marsu hit note after note
>Your attention is focused less on the game and more on Marsu
>Her thighs flex, her chest bounces around, and her tail seems to lift up whenever she has her back to you
>You’re the only one not looking at the screen
>Sudden applause snaps you out of the trance
>The onlookers are cheering Marsu on as she wheezes for air
>You manage to grab her just in time as she stumbles back against you
>She squirms around in your arms, a little startled by her fall until she realizes it’s just you
>She rubs her snout against your face, babbling incoherently
>Might be a good time for a break…

>You and your kangaroo girlfriend refuel in the restaurant side of Buck and Blaster’s
>She scarfs down nachos and chugs down a really colorful, fruity drink
>Marsu is a major lightweight when it comes to alcohol, and it doesn’t take her long to loosen up
>She’s flicking chip crumbs and blowing straw wrappers at you
>Once she expends all of her ammunition, she resorts to other antics
>At first she just smiles dreamily at you as distraction
>Then you feel her fuzzy toes work their way up your legs to your stomach
>You grab her foot and she begins laughing as you tickle it
>”N-no! S-stop!” she snorts
>Anyone who doesn’t see what’s going on under the table is probably thinking the kangaroo girl has just gone crazy
>When she settles down and sobers up a bit, Marsu takes out her pile of tickets and untangles them
>”Seems like we still have a ways to go,” she sighs. “I guess we should probably get back out there soon...”
>It’s not like you’re under a time constraint though, right?
>It’s only early in the evening, and she can always just load the tickets up on her card again to hang on to for next time
>Marsu looks like you just told her you’re taking all her games away for good
>”B-b-but...the system! What if it’s not there the next time we come?”
>With a ticket cost that steep, you doubt there’s anyone who’s going to be cashing in on it in the next few days
>The two of you can always come back later in the week
>Marsu fidgets in her seat
>”Alright, but let’s at least make a good effort tonight, okay?”
>So you and the ‘roo return to the gaming floor after clearing your tab
>The bill alone is a pretty convincing incentive to not have to come back another day
>The food isn’t even THAT good...
>You take a lap around the arcade again to check on any machines that have their jackpots built up again
>Many of the games are getting filled up with other guests again now that the evening rush has arrived
>Marsu has a look on her face that you recognize from your most intense moments with Rumble Mates
>It’s a determination she exhibits when she has a clear goal in her sights
>The ultimate prize guarded by a boss battle she’s confidant she can beat
>You suggest splitting off so you can clean up on as many machines as possible, but she clings tightly to you
>There’s no separating you two tonight
>You massage her shoulders while she plays, and she leans over yours when it’s your turn
>Marsu stuffs every large ticket payout into her pouch while you collect the little stubs
>Eventually her belly takes on a lumpy shape as the wads of tickets visible distend her pouch
>You suggest that she run to the card reloader to cash in the tickets before something happens to them, but she waves you off
>”No time! We’re so close!”
>Looks like she’s been mentally counting every ticket you’ve earned since the beginning
>What began as a goal of over 200,000 tickets has shrunk to a few thousand
>Though now with all of the popular machines either occupied or completely expended, the hunt becomes even more nerve-wracking
>At one point, Marsu spots a stream of tickets seemingly abandoned at one of the machines
>She eyes it like it’s a legendary treasure and hops toward it
>But before she can get there a little koala boy runs over and snatches them up
>Marsu has fire in her eyes, and you have to grab her tail to stop her from chasing down the child and tackling him
>Tensions are running a little high, apparently
>Just then, an open opportunity
>One of the game machines that’s been constantly occupied since you arrived clears out
>You have never seen Marsu jump so far before in a single bound
>She practically lands on her rump as she claims the vacant seat, patting the spot next to her for you to sit
>It’s a betting game
>You don’t use normal credits; you use actual tickets
>Probably the worst type of game to play with the two of you being so close to your goal
>She’s so desperate for that final little stretch she’s willing to risk it all
>And Marsu is fully aware of the gamble she’s about to make
>She keeps you away from her pouch with her leg as she fishes out a particularly long strand
>”Just trust me on this one!” she growls
>All you can do now is be her support
>Her Player Two
>Which is probably for the best, because you haven’t the slightest idea what’s going on as cards and dice and weird arcane ruins fill the already busy screen
>Though what you DO understand is when she’s winning or losing, both from the appropriate graphics on the screen and from the various grunts she makes
>It’s a good thing the speakers are shot, because the accompanying sounds from the game would probably just add to the anxiety
>By the time you pick up on what the stakes are for each move she makes, you’re at the “big one”
>And not by choice
>Marsu’s haste leads her to pressing the wrong button and going all-in for one more bet
>”There’s no going back now,” she croaks, knowing full well how badly she screwed up
>You can’t watch this one
>The inevitable disappointment is going to be too much
>Her nails click on the buttons, and you hear the game sounds make their beeps and chirps
>Then, all goes quiet
>You’re afraid to look
>You hear Marsu inhale sharply
>”No...”
>Oh boy...
>You slowly open your eyes, expecting the worst
>But Marsu is smiling broadly and pointing to the game screen
>[[ YOU ARE WINNER! ]]
>She did it
>”I did it! Sorry, didn’t mean to make you worry!”
>You almost had a heart attack because of her
>She presses her snout against your cheek and gives you little kisses as the tickets come flooding out

>The crowd is starting to thin out as Buck and Blaster’s goes full “bar mode”
>The place starts closing up to anyone not old enough to drink, meaning a lot of the younger gamers are heading out
>Kind of a shame in a way, since you already hit your goal just as the competition for getting to the best machines subsides
>Whatever
>Marsu takes out the massive pile of tickets from her pouch while you gather up your own pitiful number from a cup
>She doesn’t even need the little stubs she entrusted to you after that last major winning
>”What a night, huh?” she giggles
>The two of you make your way over to the ticket counter to cash everything in
>That’s when Marsu stops cold
>Ahead of you is the young koala boy and what you assume to be his father
>There are tears in the kid’s eyes as he looks up at the prize wall
>”I’m sorry, buddy,” the father says. “It wasn’t 10,000. There was an extra zero in there...”
>The koala boy is staring at a toy gun set with foam bullets
>The poor kid must have seen the 100,000 ticket cost sign and though it was only a tenth of that
>Neither the father nor the prize cashier looks comfortable with the crying boy on their hands
>It’s enough to get Marsu to start sniffing
>She looks at the mass of tickets in her arms
>Before you can say anything to her, she’s already padding over to the koala and the two adults
>All three of them look at her with surprise
>The kangaroo girl snaps off part of the ticket mass and hands it to the boy
>You don’t know how much it is, but it’s clearly enough to cover the full cost for the gun set
>The koala boy looks up at Marsu like she’s a superhero
>The father is speechless at first, then he clears his throat
>”Miss, are you sure...?”
>Marsu shrugs
>”Well, he’s got them now! I got all the fun I wanted tonight anyway.”
>Marsu looks back at you with a knowing smile
>All in all, it really was a good night
>The koala boy hugs Marsu’s legs before him and his father head out with the prize in tow
>You congratulate your ‘roo girl for her generosity
>Admittedly, you’re pretty proud of her
>She may have her goals and her ambitions, but at least she’s learning to play games just for the enjoyment rather than to make everything about the winning
>Marsu gives you a funny look
>”What are you talking about?”
>You ask her the same question
>”We’re not done here...”
>Come again?
>Marsu laughs, then slides a furry paw underneath your shirt
>”We’re old enough to be here, you and me,” she whispers
>She rubs your back slowly and nibbles on your ear
>”And the place is still open for another couple of hours. More than enough time to replace that hundred grand.”
>Your stomach knots up
