THE DIPLOMAT OF DIRALIA

>Be Anon Y. Mous III
>You were an average Human male at the age of 26, with a height of six feet.
>For the past several months you had been serving as a Diplomat in the Northern Kingdom of Diralia, a nation found deep within the cold taiga.
>It was a nation of Beast-Folk. Almost no Humans lived there.
>At first it had been strange not seeing any Humans. Back in your home Kingdom in the Grasslands, it was composed of pretty much solely Humans (with a small minority of Anthro Rabbits and Foxes).
>Lucky for you though, you had come to be well-liked by both the King and his court.
>You had been sent here because there had been a series of trade disputes between your home Kingdom and Diralia which threatened peace between the two nations.
>There had been a short, but bloody, war between the two nations just fifteen years ago over resources and territory. It had ended in a truce after a year of unbreakable stalemates, but many people on both sides had desires to finish the fight. 
>Currently, the two nations were at peace, but that could change in an instant if trade between the two Kingdoms was threatened. Your Kingdom sent food and luxury items to the frozen North, while Diralia shipped huge loads of metal to the warmer south. Diralia was very rich in Silver and Iron, which was one of the reasons that the war had initially started 15 years ago.
>Your job was to keep the carts moving, as well as serve as a liason between the King of Diralia and your own King.
>It was a fairly easy assignment to be honest. You got to live in the Kings palace, where a trained team of servants took care of almost your every need.
>The King always had you sit near himself during the weekly meeting of his court. All you had to do was smile, nod, and write down suggestions that the court members pitched to you, then send them off back to the Grasslands via courier.
>The King and his court seemed enthralled by tales you told of your homeland. Snow almost never fell back in your home Kingdom, and it stayed fairly warm year-round. Such a concept was unheard of this far up into the freezing North.
>All in all, you thought things were going pretty well.

>Currently, you were sitting in the quarters that had been provided for you by the King.
>It was a fairly small room, but still very luxurious. 
>You were at a small table finishing up drafting a letter to your King to inform him of several recent developments concerning trade. Several rich merchants are trying to form a trade union which could destabilize trade for simpler craftsmen.
>You're about to seal the letter, when suddenly you hear a sharp knock on the door.
>You stand up, moving across the room, and open the large wooden door
>Outside stands an Arctic Wolf, one of the Royal Honor Guard, just one of the many Beast-Men to be tasked with guarding the Royal Palace.
>He gives snaps off a quick salute before saying:
>"Anon the Diplomat! The King requests your presence in the Study. I am to escort you."
>You nod, asking what it is the King wants to discuss.
>The soldier quickly responds.
>"He did not tell me, but every private conversation with the King is an important one."
>You tell him to wait just one moment while you finish your letter.
>The guard tells you he'll wait outside. 
>"Please do not delay more than necessary, Sir. The King does not like waiting."
>You seal the letter, stamping it with your Kingdom's insignia, and your family's crest.
>You leave it on the table, and then step outside of your room.
>The guard wordlessly motions for you to follow him.
>As you walk behind him, you take note of his unique Northern armor.
>Because of the frigid cold of the North, heavy armors made of metal weren't very viable. They don't hold in heat well, and the weight would bog you down in the snow.
>Instead, he wore armor intricately crafted out of thick sheets of leather and furs. The only metal on the suit were the shoulder pauldrons, which were made out of thin plates of steel. The pauldrons served more as a symbol of rank they did as protection.
>You walked through the stone halls, large candle sconces serving to illuminate the Palace.
>It was the middle of winter, and it was already dark out. Outside the windows you could see a thin rain of snow dusting the castle and surrounding city-state. For the whole time you had been here, it had snowed almost constantly. You had no clue how the people could bear it.

>After a few minutes of walking, you come across a large pair of solid pine doors. The guard knocks twice on the door, before calling out.
>"My King! I have brought Anon as you have requested."
>A low, booming voice responds, slightly muffled through the door.
>"Very good. Open the door for him, then wait outside."
>The soldier grabs hold of one of the large doors, and opens it.
>As the door opens, a wave of heat and light washes over you.
>You step inside the Study, and the door closes behind you.
>The King's Study is a large circular room with several bookcases stretching up to the high ceiling.
>In the middle of the room a fireplace sits, with an ornate wooden desk near it.
>Directly in front of you, King Rognvald of Diralia is looking at you with a neutral expression on his face.
>He's wearing his usual garb, several fine robes, along with a large silver crown with small gemstones embedded into it.
>He was an Anthro Bear, standing at a massive 6'11". Most Beast-Folk were tall compared to Humans, but King Rognvald had to be the tallest Anthro you had ever seen.
>King Rognvald was an older man. He was in his late 60's, and had begun to slow down physically. His mind however was still sharper than the finest knife. He had always been known as a brilliant strategist, and that would likely never change.
>"Anon. Please, take a seat."
>He motions to a nearby chair which you quickly sit down in.
>After a moment, you ask him why he's requested your presence.
>"I find myself bored. I simply wish for someone to make plain conversation with."
>"I chose you in particular because unlike many members of my court, you speak honestly."
>"Also I find that I enjoy your stories a great deal."

>The two of you settle in and begin to chat about a manner of things.
>He was curious about your personal life. You knew a lot about his, but you didn't talk about yourself much. Your foremost duty was to protect your Kingdom's interests.
>"Tell me about yourself, Anon. How did you come to be a diplomat?"
>You tell him that you had been the secondborn son of a member of the King's court back in the Grasslands.
>You had a natural talent for speech, and so you had gone into politics after basic schooling.
>As you were the secondborn, you were unable to claim your father's estate after he died during a duel.
>Your brother wasn't willing to share your father's money, and so you had taken up a job with the King as an advisor.
>The King wasn't a very trusting man, and could be a little harsh. Especially when you disagreed with him.
>So it had surprised you when he gave you the job of Diplomat to Diralia.
>The King didn't trust any of his usual advisors for this assignment, as most of them had served in the war against Diralia. He thought that they might not be welcomed too warmly.
>So instead, he had chosen to send you.
>To be honest, you were pretty certain that he sent you here so you wouldn't bother him anymore.
>"Interesting. But I was more interested in your... Personal life. I notice you came to my Kingdom alone. You must be eager to return to your wife and kids in the Grasslands."
>You tell him that you had no children, and you weren't married.
>He seems legitimately surprised at this, his eyes widening.
>"You're serious? When I was your age, I had already been married for ten years, and I'd already sired my two sons!"
>You shrug, telling him you just hadn't found the right woman yet.
>The King frowns.
>"Hmpf. Things must work a lot differently in Human lands."
>"Let me tell you some advice. My firstborn son had the SAME problem. You know what it came down to in the end? Hesitation."
>He stands up, his joints popping and crackling.
>He slowly walks over to a window, and unlatches it, letting it open.
>Outside you can see the enormous City lit up by countless lanterns and candles.
>"Look at my Kingdom. Look at what I've carved out of this frozen waste. I didn't accomplish all this by hesitating."
>He looks back at you, thrusting his fist into his open palm.
>"If you have the opportunity, You must always TAKE IT!"
>He seems like he's going to say more, but he begins coughing.
>He sits back down as he comes down from the coughing fit.
>Wearily, he waves his large hand dismissively at you.
>"You may return to your quarters, Anon. I need to rest."
>As you stand up to leave, he points a finger at you.
>"And don't forget what I told you! Remember, opportunity is all around you. You just have to learn when to grasp it."
>He calls for the guard, who quickly opens the door, his hand resting on the pommel of his large sword.
>"Please escort Anon back to his room. We've finished our... Chat."
>The guard swiftly nods at the King, and he closes the door behind you ad you leave.
>You're led back through the same hall, and the guard leaves after you enter your room.
>You sit back down at the small desk and pull out another roll of parchment. It was time to write a new letter.
 
>You awaken the next morning in your bed.
>Your first sight is that of thick flurries of snow falling outside the window as the sun rises above the distant horizon.
>You sit up, yawning.
>You hop out of bed to get dressed, stretching a bit as you do so.
>After you pull on your clothes, a blue tunic and some cotton pants, you head down to the Palace kitchens, eager for some breakfast.
>Diralia was well-known for its heart cuisine. Even though the land was considered to be a frozen hell by many, the farms still produced some of the finest quality crops in the land.
>Fertile farmland was few and far between though, so the majority of the food in the Kingdom had actually been grown in the Grasslands, the trade of which had a large economic boon for your Kings' people.
>You head down a spiral staircase, passing several of the Palace servants and other Nobles.
>The servants could bring your food directly to your room, but you preferred to head down to the kitchens and eat with the other residents of the Palace.
>You WERE serving a diplomatic role, after all. It was important to keep up on your public appearances.
>As you enter the kitchens, a familiar face waves you over to her.
>It was Thora. She was a Polar Bear standing at 6'6", with fur almost as white as the snowdrifts outside. You didn't know for sure how she was related to the King, but you knew for sure that she was part of the Royal family. All the King's children were in their late 30s or 40s, but Thora was the same age as you.
>The two of you had gotten along wonderfully during the past six months, and you were pretty sure that she was your best friend in the whole of Diralia.
>"Anon! Up a bit early today?"
>As you walk over to where she's sitting, she stands up and wraps her thick arms around you, lifting you off the ground to trap you in a (literal) bear hug.
>"It is good to see you! Where have you been the last couple days? I haven't seen you..."
>Squashed in her tight embrace, you choke out that you've been busy writing reports.
>She must realize that she's holding you a "little" too tight, and she releases you, plopping you back down on your feet.
>"Oops. Sorry, Anon."
>You let out a short series of coughs, waving your hand at her to tell her you're fine.
>She sits you next to herself, and a servant elegantly sets a plate of food in front of you before rushing back to the massive hearth behind you.
>"So tell me, Anon. How goes the diplomacy?"
>You shrug, telling her that your King back in the Grasslands hadn't been sending many letters recently.
>"Really?"
>She smiles warmly at you, patting you gently on the back as you chewed a biscuit.
>"Well if you ever need someone to talk to, you know where my... Chambers are located."
>She nudges you a bit as she says that last part.
>After a moment of silence, the two of you chuckle.
>From the moment you two had become friends, casual flirting had become somewhat of an inside joke between you two. You didn't even actually know where Thora's room was located, but that didn't stop the Bear woman from mentioning it to you.
>She gently slaps you on the back as her laughing dies down.
>"I must take my leave, Anon. I have duties to attend to."
>And with that, she leaves, leaving you there to finish your breakfast alone.

>After you finish your hearty breakfast, you decide to walk the castle grounds. You didn't have anything important to do today, so you were just going to take it easy.
>You leave the small dining area, and head out into just one of many of the Palaces' courtyards.
>The original castle of Diralia had been built several hundred years ago, and it had been described as a fairly simple structure.
>Under the rule of King Rognvald however, he had managed to build onto the castle, transforming it into a sprawling Palace, a lasting symbol of his successful rule.
>Personally, you think that the king -may- have overdone it a bit. The Palace was so massive, that some parts of it seemed almost like a maze.
>The top of the courtyard had a massive glass roof, blocking out the snow and trapping in the heat. It essentially made the courtyard a sort of greenhouse.
>You liked to frequent this courtyard in particular, as many of the plants contained inside of it had been imported from the Grasslands. 
>It was like a little slice of home.
>You let out a content sigh, sitting down on a small boulder encrusted with blue-green lichens. 
>Yep. Nothing to do today except relax.

>Soon, you begin to grow a bit bored, and so you leave.
>You decide to just wander the halls for awhile.
>It's been six months since you've first arrived in Diralia, but you still haven't been able to explore the whole of the castle.
>You walk past the kitchen as you leave the courtyard, and you snag an apple as you walk past.
>The cooks make some excellent apple tarts, but in your opinion, there was NOTHING that could beat the taste of just a simple apple.
>You crunch the apple as you walk the numerous castle halls, several Anthros stopping to greet you as you walk past. Many of them had never even seen a Human before you came to Diralia, and so they regarded you almost as a sort of curiosity.
>You didn't mind. Your role was to win the hearts and minds of the people. If that meant having to answer the same questions about your species to oblivious beast-men over and over again, then so be it.
>Though some of the Anthros were a bit more... Friendly towards you then you were comfortable with.
>To some of the more lecherous Noble Women, you were simply just another conquest for them, a fact that Thora joked about a lot with you.
>So far you had managed to refuse all of their requests to visit them during the night. The last thing you wanted to do as a diplomat was cause a sex scandal among the more influential citizens of Diralia.

>You spend much of the rest of the day either wandering the Castle grounds, or chatting with residents of the Palace. 
>The same exact thing you've been doing every day for the past six months.
>The only thing that kept it fresh was... Well... Nothing, really. Sometimes it felt like the days just melted into each other.
>In other words, much of the time you were mind-numbingly bored. 
>Sometimes it felt like the only things that kept you from going insane was the occasional letter from the Grasslands, and your (almost) daily interactions with Thora.
>She always had something funny to say, a story to tell, and a back-breaking hug for you.

>You decide to skip lunch, as you weren't feeling very hungry.
>Instead, you opt to grab some literature from the Palac library. 
>You hadn't expected the Beast-Men of Diralia to have such a rich record of literature. It was almost as big as the Library back in your home Kingdom. 
>You spend the rest of the day sitting in the Library reading accounts of ancient battles that once took place in the frosty tundra.
>Pretty soon though, the skies begin to darken, and your stomache begins to grumble at your decision to skip a meal.
>Putting the book back on the shelf, you head back down to the kitchens.
>When you get down there however, one of the servants informs you that your dinner has already been brought up to your room.
>You thank him, then head to your quarters, eager to sample what the cooks have whipped up for you.
>Opening the door to your room, you can smell your meal before you see it.
>It was a rich stew consisting of mushrooms and rabbit meat, with a thick slice of dense bread to enjoy alongside it. You even got a small bottle of the King's special ale, a rare treat he reserved only for personal friends of his.
>You savor the delicious supper down to the last bite. It was leagues better than anything the cooks back in the Grasslands had ever made for you.
>Soon after you finish, a servant knocks on your door, asking for your plate so he can wash it.
>You comply, asking him to thank the Chefs in charge of preparing the meal for you.
>He smiles, telling you he would be happy to.
>He shuts the door before scurrying off, leaving you alone with your thoughts.

>Before you go to sleep, you opt to gaze out your small window at the sprawling city below the Palace. It was a view you would never tire of.
>You're about to change into your sleepwear, when a sudden sharp knock on the door startes you.
>A visitor at this hour? You would have thought everyone would have been asleep by now.
>You open the door, and are greeted by the furry face of a Snow Leopard.
>You had never seen you before, and so you're confused by her sudden appearance.
>She was wearing fine sleepwear which didn't leave much to the imagination. It fit her like a silk glove, accentuating her eye-catching features.
>Before you can ask her who she is, she walks right past you and plops down on your bed. 
>She begins to speak in a somewhat nervous tone of voice.
>"It is nice to finally meet you, Anon... My name is Hekja."
>"I was told by the King to provide you with... Companionship. For the night."
>Good lord, it was one of the King's personal whores.
>"I must admit... I've never been with a human before. I don't think any of my, um, "associates" have. They'll be so jealous when they learn I was first to taste of you..."
>Uncomfortably, you shift your weight back and forth on each leg.
>You tell her that if it was all the same to her, you would rather sleep alone.
>Upon hearing this, she seems immensely disappointed. 
>"Wh-What? Why?!"
>She looks afraid for a second.
>"I-Is there something wrong with me? I spent an hour grooming myself for this..."
>You quickly assure her that she was fine, and that she looked stunning.
>She just didn't fit your... Personal preferences. 
>She seems confused by this.
>"Oh... Um... Would you like me to send up one of my... Male associates?"
>You choke on your own saliva, waving your hand at her and telling her no, saying that you werent gay.
>You tell her you had nothing against Anthros. You just wanted your first time to be something special with someone you loved.
>She opens her mouth as if to respond, but she shuts it after a moment, seemingly unsure of what to say.
>"Well... Alright."
>"I'll take my leave, then. A good night to you, Anon."
>She slowly gets off of your bed, standing up with a dejected expression on her face as she shuffles out of the room.
>You sigh when she shuts the door, sitting down on the bed and rubbing your face.
>Dammit. That just ruined your night.
>The King had never sent a sex worker to your room, and you were really wishing that he would have asked you for your approval before he sent her.
>You pick up a loose white hair off of your pillow, flicking it onto the floor.
>You get up and change into your nightwear, setting your day clothes into a small basket for the sevants to wash.
>You lay down on your bed, sliding under the blankets. 
>The new memory of the uncomfortable situation you were just in keeps you awake for some time, but you're eventually able to fall asleep.

>You wake up the next morning a bit tired. You didn't sleep very peacefully.
>The morning proceeds normally, with you getting dressed before heading down to the kitchens.
>Something seems up with Thora when you go to eat next to her though. 
>Her hug lasts a lot longer than it normally does, and she seems almost giddy about something.
>You've never seen her this excited. 
>She refuses to tell you what she's looking forward to though, telling you that you would find out soon enough.
>As you eat your breakfast, Thora just stares at you with a dopey smile.
>When you finish eating, Thora jumps up to give you another tight hug before you leave. Weird. She usually only gave you just one hug.
>She tells you that she has to go prepare for "something important", and that she'll see you soon.

>As you were still a bit tired, you elect to relax in the same courtyard you were in yesterday.
>It would be a nice way to relax outside without freezing to death.
>When you get out to the courtyard, it's thankfully empty as usual.
>You find a nice spot to sit, and you close your eyes as you rest in the warm courtyard.
>Eventually though, your peace is interrupted when the doors to the inner hallway open, and the same Royal Guard from a couple days ago approaches you.
>He holds a stoic expression as he greets you with a voice a little louder than you would prefer.
>"My greetings to you, Anon the Diplomat!"
>You nod at him, giving him a simple greeting.
>"I have a message for you."
>"The King is holding a private dinnee for his court tonight. He has asked that you attend."
>You perk up a bit, asking him what it was for, only to see him frown a bit as he responds.
>"I... Am not sure. Only the King and his court are allowed inside. Not even the guards are permitted to enter."
>"Do not worry though! I am sure it will essentially be simply a private gathering."
>"I will retrieve you when it is time for you to attend. Until then, please enjoy the amenities of the castle."
>As soon as he finishes speaking, he quickly turns to leave the room, the large doors swinging shut behind him.
>A private dinner, huh?
>You had been to lots of feasts with the King, but they were pretty informal.
>This however, seemed like it could be important.

>You grab a small lunch consisting of some fruits and bread, then head up to your room.
>You prepare yourself for the dinner, bathing yourself, and putting on your finest clothes.
>Eventually, the guard returns to take you to the dinner.
>"Follow me, please. Everyone else is already there."
>He leads you into the upper portion of the palace, usually reserved for the Royal family only. You've only been up here two other times. When you first got here, and another time when you got lost.
>The area looks immaculate, with fine furnishings and ornamental decorations everywhere.
>Overall, It's impressive, even for a King.
>The guard leads you to a small set of doors, opening them for you.
>He ushers you inside, then shuts it behind you.

>Inside the room sits a smaller number of people than you expected.
>Sitting at the table dominating the room is King Rognvald, his Spiritual advisor, a couple of his closest friends, and a Polar Bear woman you've never met before.
>You take a seat at the one vacant chair, sitting directly across from the King.
>One thing is for certain. This most definitely is NOT a formal dinner with the King's court. 
>He clears his throat with a loud grumble, before speaking.
>"Anon. Good, you've made it. We've been waiting."
>He shifts in his chair, brushing a loose strand of fur off of his shoulder.
>"There's really no easy way to ease into this, so I'm just going to say it."
>"Anon, I'm offering you the hand of my youngest daughter, Thora, in marriage. Do you accept?"
>You freeze, your teeth clenching.
>What. The. FUCK.
>You cough, the King raising an eyebrow at your reaction.
>"Anon. I asked you a question."
>What the hell?! Thora was his daughter!?
>King Rognvald growls, a frown on his face.
>"I am not a very patient man, Anon. Especially when awaiting the answer to such an important question."
>Oh, shit!
>It's probably in your best interests to accept.
>Refusing large offers from King Rognvald would not be very beneficial for your health. You've heard stories of what happens to people who offended the King. None of them were very pleasant.
>You look him dead in the eyes and say "Yes".
>King Rognvald stares at you with a serious face for a moment.
>You're about to try and book it out the door, when he suddenly claps his hands together loudly, letting out a loud laugh.
>"Great! That is good to hear. I was worried I would never find someone willing to marry her."
>What the fuck is even going on right now!?
>The King must notice your alarm, as his smile fades into a more serious expression.
>"You're Thora's most frequent companion, and her favorite acquaintance. She told me of her desires to see you as her husband one day."
>"That day is very close, it would seem."
>You tell him that you didn't even know Thora was his daughter.
>He raises a furred eyebrow at you, then lets out another hearty laugh.
>"Anon, you're one of the finest Humans that I've ever known, but sometimes I swear you can be duller than pine tar. Of course she's my daughter! Why else would another one of my species be living in the Palace!?"
>You tell him that she didn't really... have that "royal feel" to her.
>"And just WHAT is that supposed to mean?"
>Oh fuck.
>You quickly try to salvage the situation, telling her that she was very pleasant, and unlike any royalty that you've ever met. Back in The Grasslands, much of the royal family was rather... Well, prudish would be the polite word to describe them.
>He gives you a knowing smile.
>"Yes, I am aware that my daughter doesn't care for the royal lifestyle. A fact that has irritated me to no end."
>You ask him why he never told you that Thora was his daughter.
>He simply shrugs.
>"You never asked. Besides, she doesn't hold any power. She's an Illegitimate Child. A Royal Bastard. She was conceived during a rather... Rousing night after a feast."
>The Polar Bear woman next to him groans, finally speaking up.
>"Anon. My name is Gudrid. I am the mother of Thora."
>"The... -Man- sitting next to me is indeed her Father. His grace allowed me and my daughter to live in the Palace along within him."
>You reach a hand out to greet her, but she just stares at you in confusion.
>Shit, she must not be familiar with Human greetings.
>The King chuckles, and whispers something in her ear.
>Gudrid rolls her eyes, and firmly grasps your hand. Maybe a bit -too- firmly. Ow.
>After a quick handshake, her hand rests back on the table.
>While you nurse your freshly bruised hand, the King resumes speaking.
>"I've read up on Human courtship rituals in preparation for this. In case you are curious why Thora isn't here among us, It's traditional for the Daughter to pick a male to be her mate. She speaks her wish to her parents, and they decide whether or not they're worthy of their Daughter."
>"In this case, while it may be a bit... Controversial for a Human to marry a member of the royal family, let alone an Illegitimate member of it... I acknowledge Thora's wish to marry you, and I grant consent for you two to become wed."
>After the King says this, all eyes turn to Gudrid.
>She looks at you with one eyebrow raised, her eyes scanning over you.
>"Eh. I suppose."

>King Rognvald seems upset at how Gudrid brushes off the question, but nonetheless, the deed has been done.
>He nods to Gudrid, and tells her that she is free to leave if she wishes.
>You however, must stay.
>As Gudrid silently walks out the door, the King turns to face you.
>"We have much to discuss, Anon. This is an extremely important event. A royal wedding!"
>Fuck, you've never even been to a NORMAL wedding!
>The King reaches over the table to pat you warmly on the shoulder.
>"You shouldn't have any concerns. We'll teach you the proper etiquette for a Diralian wedding. It may be a bit... -Different- than a Human wedding..."
>You don't like the sound of that.
>"We'll go over the customs later. For NOW, we must discuss the implications of this marriage."
>"Listen. I want to make this next point Crystal. Clear."
>"Even though you are marrying a member of the royal family, you will NOT have any claim to either Diralian land, or power over its citizens."
>"If you and my daughter choose to purchase land, everything will be in HER name."
>"I don't have anything against you, but the People may think differently. There's still many open wounds leftover from the war. This is all to make sure you aren't killed by a mob."
>He holds his paws up in a reassuring gesture.
>"No worries."
>"After the marriage, you will still be living in the palace. Just in different quarters, along with your new wife."
>You nod, listening intently.
>The King goes on, listing many of the other politics and and specifics relating to marrying into the Royal family.
>The whole process takes around 5 hours.
>He may be old, but by God, can he talk.
>By the end, you're barely keeping your eyes awake.
>"Alright, and that -should- be everything."
>He frowns, tapping the table with a claw.
>"Anon! Are you paying attention."
>You immediately perk up, nodding and apologizing.
>"Ah, don't worry about it. We'll go over this again some other time, either before or after the wedding."
>"For now though, go and get some rest. It's going to be an extremely busy week for you."
>The King motions to the Royal Guard standing behind you, still standing alert.
>"Escort Anon here back to his quarters. Oh, and fetch him some dinner."
>The Guard bows to the King, before leading you out of the doors.
>Soon enough, you're sitting back in your room, a steaming bowl of rabbit stew in front of you.
>As you spoon mouthfuls of the rich broth into your mouth, you muse about the near future.
>You should really write a letter to your King to tell him about this, but you're kind of afraid of what his response will be.
>He was pretty specific in your instructions for this assignment. You're pretty certain that none of them said "Marry into the Royal Family".
>You really hoped things would all turn out okay.
 
>The rest of the week crawls by at a tortuously slow pace.
>Whether it's spent learning about the finer points of Diralian politics, wedding traditions, or even how to carry yourself like a member of the royal family, it seems like each lesson lasts forever.
>You had sent the letter to your own nation's King, but he had yet to respond. You hoped he wouldn't be angry.
>In any case, you knew King Rognvald would keep you safe. Whether it be from your own King, or other Beast-People living in Diralia. After the public announcement was made of your engagement to Thora, it was with a degree of outcry by many citizens. The scars from the war still ran deep among many people...
>On a more positive note, it seems that members of the Nobility, or other high-class citizens, were in great favor towards your impending union with Thora, many of them showing public support for the two of you. Sure, it was probably for their own political gains, but the sentiment of it was nice.
>Looking ahead, you still had a bit more planning to do, but the wedding date was already fixed. Only six days from now, you would be a married man. Married to a beast-woman. Married to your friend. Married to Thora.
>Well... As far as arranged marriages go, it could be a -LOT- worse. At the very least, you genuinely liked Thora and had always gotten along with her. Plus, being married to a princess was like every wet dream you had as a teenager come true.
>Sure, you were a bit worried about how this was going to effect your life, but until you came across a problem, why not enjoy this? After all, you -were- getting married...
>Currently, you were sitting in your chambers, staring at the outfit you were supposed to wear for your wedding.
>It had been custom-made for you by a particularly annoying tailor. She had never made an outfit for a Human, and so she was a bit overly eager to take measurements. Extremely "thorough" measurements.
>The outfit looked a bit strange to you, being a combination of decorative armor, fine cloths, and a large animal pelt serving as a sort of cape.
>It was a far cry from the ceremonial robes one would wear back in the Grasslands, but as long as you were in Diralia, you would abide by Diralian customs. You really didn't want to risk offending anyone, considering the fact that you were already pissing some Beast-People off by marrying into the royal family.
>Besides. The wedding garb looked kind of neat if you looked at it long enough. In any case, you were going to wear it, so you had better learn to like it.
>You tap your foot against the ground, uneasy.
>You hadn't seen Thora since before the King had offered you her hand, and you really wanted to talk to her about this whole thing. Sadly though, similar to your own nations' traditions, it wasn't customary for a groom to meet with his bride before the big day.
>Sighing, you stand up a bit, stretching.
>You still had more lessons to go through, and you were going to need some rest if you wanted any hope if you wanted to make it through them without passing out from boredom.
>Minutes later, you were in bed, staring out the uncurtained window as moonlight spills over you. It was snowing, the fat flakes of snow casting shadows as what they passed in front of the old window.
>It doesn't take long for you to fall asleep.
