>Two short, curvy cats are faced with a dilemma:
>They've heard that humans only like tall cat women.
>But, one of them has an epiphany after watching some human media. One purchase of an XL trench coat later, and the two wily cats are on their way.
>There's just one problem...
>The one on the bottom is a bit more forward than her friend.
>Imagine their unsuspecting date's shock when he feels someone unzip his fly and start licking his cock while his date is still sitting across from him and chatting away.

>After scaring off their first date, the two get into a heated discussion as to what to do next time.
>Decide to swap positions.
>Problem with that is... the previous "face" isn't as strong as her pervy friend.
>Their new date is convinced that "she's" drunk, as the duo sway and nearly topple multiple times.
>Everything goes pretty well; the new face is more openly flirty and suggestive than the other, but this human seems receptive.
>Everything goes great until the human gets a little handsy...
>He reaches up under the coat and freaks out when his hand touches fangs.
>The two promptly fall over when he runs away screaming.

>After that incident, the two agree that it's probably best to swap out positions depending on the situation.
>Lucy is the stronger of the two, but also more prone to shameless teasing and getting a bit too forward with their dates.
>Meanwhile, Lily is more understated, getting easily flustered at any suggestive implications. However, she's the more personable of the two, and was the one to come up with the trenchcoat disguise in the first place.
>Tonight, they were to meet another human for dancing. Which presented another problem...
>Lucy is by far the better of the two at moving around while carrying the other...
>But her dancing is godawful. She herself once described it as "like a ragdoll being put through a blender that's being put into a bigger blender."
>Lily, however, is far more graceful on her feet... but is nearly incapable of carrying Lucy without stumbling around.
>They're stumped as to what to do...
>Too late to cancel now. Lily reluctantly takes up the lower position as they head off to meet their date.
>Immediately, he seems impressed by their height... well, two 4' women standing on each other's shoulders would probably be pretty impressive to a 6' man.
>Unfortunately, he's less impressed by their wobbling, uncoordinated moves. Lily tries her best to dance with the coat obscuring her eyes and Lucy's weight bearing down...
>But alas, she falls down, with her friend landing on her back roughly.
>Naturally, seeing his date halve in size worries the human into calling an ambulance.
>The Trenchcats end up having to scramble out of the nightclub, with Lucy shredding a nearby woman's top to serve as a distraction.
>...unfortunately, the single shewolf's now-bare chest catches their date's wandering eyes in more ways than one.
>Back at their shared apartment, Lucy and Lily shake their heads and sigh as the news reporters talk about a man arrested for sucking on a shewolf's breasts in public.
>Better luck next time, ladies.
