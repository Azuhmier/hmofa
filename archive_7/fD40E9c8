>”hey, how’s it goin’? haven’t hung out in a while, huh?”
>she sounds like she’s trying to mask physical pain 
>greet her and ask her how she’s been
>”uh, i’ve been alright, kinda”
>you walk into her house and holy shit it’s hot in here
>with it being in the middle of winter, you’d imagine she’d have her house fairly heated
>but you didn’t think it’d be this hot
>”heh, sorry for the temperature. been keeping my windows open and I haven’t had the motivation to leave my room”
>uh-huh

>that’s more than all previous sessions combined 
>odd, but you’re not complaining 
>you end the next game with a brutality
>you pop off, that’s the first time you’ve gotten one on her
>she congratulates you, but she looked less and less interested in the game as it goes on
>she’s distracted by something 
>”can we take a break? i need to recharge so I can stop losing”
>uh-huh 
>you recline against the wall on her bed
>she suddenly climbs on top of you and lays down
>what is she doing
>”shh... just let me enjoy this”
>kinda weird... kinda cute
>she’s making small, barely audible whimpers as she cuddles against you
>the whimpers slowly get more and more loud as she crawls closer to your face
>uhh
>at first it was cute, but now it’s starting to get weird
>with how hot it is in here, you’re sweating a lot
>and she not helping 
>with her intense cuddling and body heat 
>it’s kinda hot, in a sexual way
>you start to get hard
>fuck, this is awkward
>”aren’t you hot in this getup? c’mon, cool down a little”
>yeah you are actually
>you can loose the jacket
>and maybe roll up your sleeves
>”you must be hot in those pants too”
>ok what the fuck
>your best friend is now cuddling up against you, while you’re in your boxers
>in a hot room, while sweating profusely
>she’s not even trying to hide it now
>those short shorts are pressed against your erection
>her breasts are pressed against your chest
>fuck, you better say something
>uhh
>uhh
>uhh
>what do you say?
>reject her? talk dirty?
>rejecting her could end this all and likely preserve the friendship, but this is the closest you’ve been to sex
>talking dirty could enhance the mood
>c’mon, think anon, think!
>your rambling thoughts are interrupted by her whispering something to you
>”i need you, anon”
>fuuuuck
>she’s grinding against you now
>porn never prepared you for this
>>let me your wheel, angel
>...
>”...what?” 
>FUCK
>you had one chance you say something and you fucked it up
>you tried saying four different pickup lines at once
>her confident and lusty visage is broken by your awful line
>you stutter out a few incoherent sounds before she shushes you
>”shh it’s okay. I’ll take the lead, i guess”
>you ruined the mood
>now, even as she’s pulling your boxers down and grasping your cock, you can’t get back into the it
>you could’ve tried kissing
>that was actually a good idea
>fuck, why didn’t you think of that
>she gave your member a long lick
>it feels good
>...yeah
>she’s giving you a blowjob now, or what she interprets as one
>she’s taking barely any of it, and teeth are kind of painful
>what do you even say
>it’s so quiet in here
>all you have hear is her trying to suck you off
>after a while, she stops
>she crawls closer to you and hovers her cooch over your cock
>she has a look of uncertainty on her face
>”here goes...” 
>your cock enters her
>you did it
>you’re not a virgin anymore, but at what cost?
>your friendship?
>your dignity?
>a chance at a relationship with her? 
>she’s slowly inserting it into herself
>fuck it’s tight
>her visage of an experienced fox is long gone
>you’re unsure of what to do now
>hug her? is that what you do during sex?
>you raise your hands and place them on her hips as she shakily continues to lower herself
>she’s moaning and whimpering, but you can’t help but stay completely quiet
>eventually she stops and puts a concerned look on her face
>”everything alright, anon? do you want me to stop?”
>you stutter as you try to explain how it’s your first time and you’re anxious
>her face changes from a concerned look to a soft smile
>as you continue stuttering, she places a finger over your mouth and makes a shushing sound
>”it’s alright we don’t need to rush things. i’m a virgin as well, so you don’t need to feel obliged to do anything more”
>she removes herself from your cock and cuddles up to you
>”i may be in heat, but i haven’t lost self-control. i can wait a few more hours”
>she moves up to your lips for a kiss
>you make an honest-to-god attempt at not fucking it up this time
>her lips meet yours
>her wet nose brushes against your face as you two meet lips
>you don’t want this to end
>her tongue prods at your mouth, waiting to enter
>you oblige, letting her take control
>your tongues wrestle for dominance
>you lose, not that you’re upset about it
>her tongue explores every crevice of your mouth as you submit to her strength
>eventually she pulls away, leaving a trail of saliva as she does
>you both sit and stare at each other in silence
>but this time, it isn’t awkward
>it feels like this is an embrace 
>like her eyes are pulling you into a warm hug
>she smiles 
>”c’mon. let’s go try something else, we can save this for later”
>but isn’t she still in heat?
>”yea, and it burns, but i’ll save myself for when you’re ready” 
>you both clothe yourselves and sit back on her bed
>”sorry if i rushed things. i couldn’t take the heat anymore, and sorry if i forced myself upon you” 
>you tell her it’s alright, at least the friendship wasn’t ruined
