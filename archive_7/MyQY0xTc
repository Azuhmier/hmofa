>The world is dead
>Everyone is
>Well you aren't
>But you should be
>You survived because you're a coward
>But being brave got all those courageous men and women and the beasts humanity created killed
>No one remembers how the war started or even who ended it
>Just how it ended
>Someone somewhere unleashed a virus that infected and killed humans
>Most humans anyway
>What was once a population of over 7 billion is reduced to less than 50000 worldwide
>At least, that's what they said before the radios shut off
>You survived because you dodged the draft and won the genetic lottery
>The disease that killed all of humanity gave you the worst flu like symptoms ever
>But you survived
>You were Anon, now a wanderer
>The last human you met was 2 years ago
>A man and his 2 sons
>They were headed to the human colony in Florida
>You told them not to but they didn't listen
>You had been there
>A swarm of Anthro locusts was there
>You learned Anthro locusts were omnivorous 
>You survived because you ran
>You ran and ran and ran
>The screams of those being eaten alive ringing in your ears
>You were in what should be Washington State now
>You've met Anthros along the way
>Some were openly hostile to you
>Some tried to eat you
>Most looked at you with pity
>You knew it was because you were probably the last human they were ever going to meet
>You should be dead, your family all died around you, your fiancé died in your arms
>And yet here you were, doomed to live and too cowardly to end it yourself
>You had tried
>Now you just wandered
>You couldn't settle in an Anthro community. 
>How could you look them in the face after what humanity did to them
>Bred them and poked at them until humans had a disposable fighting force 
>And in the end they were immune to the virus
>This world was theirs now and you were just living on borrowed time until you died of whatever or you just gave up and let them eat you
>You needed to catch something to eat
>You could smell a winter snowstorm on the horizon
>It's amazing what you can smell without pollution
>You set up a snare trap and bait it
>You had seen deer tracks around here
>Easy plan, catch a deer, kill it, and then find some shelter to wait out the storm
>You had your basic gear with you
>Your leather armor, creased and stained from the years of use
>Your crossbow; rifle ammunition was hard to find 
>And a spear you had made with a long sharp point you forged and a shaft of ironwood
>Along with various tools for killing, skinning, and sharpening
>A water canteen
>And some food that would last if you didn't catch a deer but still you would rather not waste your reserve of dried insects, peanut butter packets and Various jerky from several different animals
>You hide under a pine tree and totally bury yourself in the needles
>Better catch a nap while you can
~~~~
>You awoke with a start
>Your Snare went off and that means food
>But you hear something more
>Shouting?
>SHOUTING! 
>People!
>You get up and rush to your trap 
>Your heart sinks at what you caught
>An Anthro wolverine is dangling upside down by one footpaw, waving a stone axe and throwing a string of curses that don't make sense
>"CUNTSTAINEDPISSFUCKERASSDIGGERTWATWAFFLEMUFIINMAN"
>It spots you
>"GODDAMMIT I SURVIVE FOR YEARS ALONE AND GET TO GET KILLED BY A GODDAMNED HUMAN COME HERE I'LL CHOP YA LEGS OFF”
>You find your voice
>It’s been at least 10 months since you've had to use it
>"Look man, I didn't mean --"
>"MAN?!?! THE FIRST FUCKER I MET IN YEARS AND THEY THINK I’M A GODDAMN MAN! FUCK ME SIDEWAYS"
>You step back and look at...Her with better attention
>You can now clearly see that she is indeed a female, you can now see she had what would be amounted to rags covering her Orange sized breasts and a loincloth (flipped because she’s upside down)
>And she’s small
>Like 3 and a half feet tall
>"Looks please calm down Miss. I wasn't trying to catch you, I saw deer tracks and wanted to catch one before the storm" you says trying to calm her
>She stops swinging her stone ax around for a second
>"How didja know a storm is coming? I smelled something weird and wanted to investigate and possibly eat it, turns out it was you"
>"I can smell it, anyway let me get you down"
>You hesitate
>"You aren't going to chop my legs off like you said right?" you ask, raising an eyebrow at her
>"Nah just let me down, it's my own fault for stepping into a fuckin obvious trap" she snaps at you
>You walk over the trap line and slowly lower her down
>As she sets down she tried furiously to undo the knot around her leg
>"Whoa whoa you're just gonna make it worse, let me" you say as you kneel next to her working on the knot
>"Ah so my eyes were not tricking me, you are a human. I haven't seen one of your kind since...” she rambles off
>"Yea. Just me now I reckon" you say solemnly
>"Yea probably" she says scratching her muzzle
>"My name is Anon by the way"
>"Zahrah" she spits out simply
>"Look I'm sorry I-"
>"I told ya I wandered into it without thinking don't apologize for setting a good trap I'm just mad tha- " She freezes mid-sentence, her ears flat and her tail rigid
>"What is it" you recognize her action immediately and try to lower yourself
> "I can smell deer"
>Deer! Thank god 
>"Where?"
>She points northwest ward
>You unsling your crossbow and load it
>She on all fours
>"Follow me anon, let’s see if you're any good with that toy of yours"
>You follow, years of hiding have honed your skill at walking silently
>After about 10 minutes of walking she points
>"I can't see too well at distances. What do you see?" she says to you
>A herd, at least 15 individuals all grazing
>"Deer" you say simply
>"How many can you get?"
>We'll see 
>You shoulder your crossbow and aim down the sights
>You hold your breath and aim at one at the outside of the group
>A doe
>There is a slight "Thwip" and it collapses you bolt went right through its head you guess
>"One down"
>She shudders, that must be exciting
>"God damn I can’t use those projectiles, my eyes..." 
>You reload
>Take aim 
>The buck is there, at least 250 lbs. of meat in addition to the 100 from the doe
>"Thwip" 
>It crumples 
>It makes a "Mehhhhhh" as it falls and that spooks the rest
>Goddammit
>"So how many?" 
>"2" you answer
>"Just 2? And here I thought you were use-"
>"I got the buck" you cut her off
>"A big un?" she says looking up at you. 
> "At least 200 pounds" you say
>"Hm maybe you are useful"
>You go to the buck, the bolt is buried in its skull
>You pull it out and wipe it on your pants
>Stained leather
>Zahrah is at the doe
>"I can't see your bolt anon"
>You glance at the tree line and see it lodged in a tree
>"Well Zahrah, it's been a pleasure working with you" you say as you pull it out and put it in its quiver
>"Wait" she says grabbing your arm
>When did she get next to you?
>"A storms coming, you ain’t got nowhere to go, might as well shack up with me for the time being" she says matter of factly
>You smile
>You were starved for interaction
>Even though you were an introvert before it all went to shit you valued at least some interaction
>You felt recently like T.Hanks from castaway talking to yourself 
>She's surprisingly strong
>You hefted the buck in a fireman's carry and she lifted the doe with no issue 
>You followed her for a while until you found yourself and an old cabin
>How did she?
>"I've lived here my whole life" she says reading your mind
>You both unload and get to work, you gut, carve and skin the deer
>"Hey I want those intestines" she says
>"Fine, I want the heart" 
>"Deal"
>You're trading body parts, great
>"Come on, I’ve got a smoker over here" she says 
>You move the not lighter deer corpse to the smokers each bit of flesh hanging to be preserved
>"Come on then" she goes inside beckoning you
>"Alright. The beds over there, the fireplace is there and the kitchen is there, the outhouse is outside, you want fresh water you gotta go pump it out now"
>Oh man fresh well water. You know that running water from streams is supposed to help with bacteria that can cause illnesses
>But that's not 100%
>Catching rainwater or boiling works but that's usually a hassle
>But now that you weren't hunting or trading body parts you could get a good look at your hostess
>Again she was short, like 3 and a half foot tops
Her fur was black on the back, her stomach and chest had like brown fur and on her head she had a white streak down the middle 
>It reminded you of a Mohawk
>She was curvy for being short and that surprised you 
>"You got a problem there?" she caught you staring
>"Oh s-sorry, I just haven't seen an Anthro wolverine before" you say as you look down.
>"Well at least ya could tell I’m a wolverine and not a goddamn badger" she says with a laugh
>"If we're gonna be studying each other come 'ere let me get a good look at cha" 
>You walk closer to her
>"My eyesight ain't so good, so get closer"
>What was it you read about wolverines long ago?
>Small, strong, ferocious for their size, able to take down full grown deer, males can hold miles of territory and often fight wolves
>If she wanted she could have killed you at any time
>You shiver
>"What cha shivering for? Ya cold?" she says as she walks small circles around you
>"You're so goddam lanky, but you're good with that crossbow of yer's" she looks at your spear
>"Now where didja get that spear?" she says eyeing it with envy
>"Oh-I uh -- I made it" you say 
>No need to lie
>"You made it? How?" she says looking up at you
>"Uh... Before the war I was learning how to blacksmith as a hobby for Ren fairs..."
>"Wotsa Ren fair?" she asks
>"Oh it was a kinda festival were people would dress in suits of armor and swords and pretend it was the medieval times" you explain
>"Uh huh...When were those again?" 
>Right, she probably didn't have much education
>Few Anthros did, after all they were cannon fodder during the war....
>"It was a long time ago before the war." you say
"Sounds stupid" she says bluntly "but making metal  ...that is useful....
>"Anyway you hungry? We can cook up some of that deer we got" she asks
>"Sure I could go for some food. Also thanks for letting me shack up while the storm passes"
>She waves you off
>"Is nothing'" she says and she throws a 3 lb. slab of deer meat onto a metal grate above the fire "you helped get us some deer meat easier than I could have alone, usually I have to settle on squirrel or something the wolves killed"
>Right wolverines were mainly scavengers....
>You smile "that was mutually beneficial, after all you found them with your nose"
>"Yea but I can't see for shit, never could, and there ain't a place to get glasses anymore"
>She's right you could maybe scavenge reading glasses but it sounded like she needed a serious prescription
>You are silent for a while both looking at the meat cook and the fire (Survival TV)
>Finally she breaks the silence "how do ya take your meat? Well done?" she says, cutting about 2 lbs. of meat away from the slab
>Its rare and somewhat bloody still
>You guess that's her portion
>"Medium rare actually"
>She looks at you, "Oh? An adventurous human, my lucky day"
>She pokes the meat
>"It'll be a minute or two then"
>"Can't be that lucky of a day, after all you did get caught in a trap and then exposed to a total stranger" you say with a short laugh
>"Fuck" she says "Ya saw everythin' didn't cha?"
> "I mean I did but I was more focused on the small wolverine lady swinging an ax at me and swearing so much a sailor would blush"
>She laughs at that.
>"I missed this kinda stuff" she says
>"Hm? What stuff?"
>"Talkin', the only things I’ve met fer a while tried to kill me outright"
>"Hm... I thought wolverines enjoyed solitude mostly" you say rubbing your chin, your beard was coming in again
>No need to shave in the apocalypse except grooming
>"We are but I’m no feral, I live in the woods by myself and not in some goddam colony" she says calmly "But I still enjoy talking to someone, solitude and loneliness are sometimes one and the same"
>You couldn't argue
>The world ended but for you...
>No more job to worry about, no mortgage, no SJWs no nothing...just you living.
>But at times when sleep was just outside your grasp
>You felt it. The feeling everyone feels late at night, the loneliness, the existential dread of everything everywhere
>Humans are....Were social creatures
>Even the most outcast person wanted companionship 
>You think of hugging her but decide against it
>Hugging a total stranger is weird
>Take off your leather face mask and sigh
>You usually wear a leather face mask that covers your mouth and nose
>Keeps your breath hidden due to all the various blood and animal whatnot that have covered it
>Deer and some predators can smell human breath, at least you heard they can.
>You saw a video once of a hunter spraying himself with elk piss to cover his scent then spraying it INTO his mouth
>You weren’t Bear Grylls, you weren't drinking piss
>"Ah the face of the human" Zahrah says with a chuckle "it’s weird seeing a beard below a face cover" 
>"I’ve been all over. Most places don't have green forests like this anymore, I needed the mask to not breathe in the dust and sand" you say
>"You've been wandering awhile haven't you anon"
>"Needed to"
>She pulls your slab on meat of the fire pit
>"Why?" she asks handing it to you on a wooden plate
>She starts eating her own chunk of deer now
>"Humans are dead, the last colony I was at got over run" you explain
>"By what?" she asks
>"Locusts"
>"Oh....."
>They were one of the wars worst creations
>An unending swarm that ate everything 
>They couldn't be controlled, couldn't be tamed, and couldn’t be stopped
>"Then why not an Anthro colony? I’m sure one would accept an amateur blacksmith"
>"After all humans did to Anthros, how could I"
>You sigh
>You were afraid on most Anthros
>Humanity created them to fight so humans lives would be spared
>They were literally born to die
>You were ashamed for all of mankind
>"H-how could I find a place when I never even fought? When the draft came I fled to Canada, then when the sickness came no one even cared I came back because they were all dying"
>She's looking at you 
>You take a bite of your own deer streak
>It's warm and it’s good, 
>If only you had seasoning
>"Sorry... Shat got pretty serious" you say ashamed
>"Don't be sorry, that's some serious shit to keep inside" she’s already eaten half her deep portion
>You both finish your meals in silence
>"Hey ah Ze, you don't mind if I call you Ze right?" you ask
>"Naw, I don't mind but what's up?"
>"We should bring in some more firewood, if this storm is going to be so serious that I can smell it then we should have plenty more" 
>She looks at her pile of wood in the corner and frowns slightly
>"Yea yer probably right"
>You get up and walk to the door
>You open it and already it's beginning to snow 
>For about 15 minutes you and Zahrah bring in wood
>She chopped all this with an ax made of stone?
>You were impressed
>You sit down next to the fire now and Zahrah sits close to you
>You stay like this for about an hour
>You're tired, the well water was going to have to wait
>Besides if you needed water you had a constant fire to attend to and boiling water would be easier here
>You're nodding off
>You snap awake as Ze speaks
>"Geez Anon, if your that tired let’s just go to bed"
>She's getting up and moving to the bed
>"Get out of them leather bullshits you're wearing, I ain't having any of that kinda mess in my bed" she says eyeing you
>"Oh uhh okay" is all you say
>You strip down to just undergarments
>It felt good to not have to wear all that gear
>You never really took it off when travelling
>Better keep it on in case you had to run
>But you didn't need to run anywhere now.
>"There's only one bed so we are gonna hafta share" she says "keep yer mitts to yerself or ill bite your fuckin dick off"
>You cringed thinking about that
>You climb into the bed and Zahrah follows suit
>You sleep on your back generally because it easier to get up faster
>You pull the covers, a few animal skins, over both you and Zahrah
>She turns onto her side and faces away from you
>You don't mind 
>You fall asleep in a bed for the first time in a long time
~~~
>You wake up and you're warm
>The furs from the random animals must be doing their job keeping you warm
>But still really warm
>And ...Heavy?
>You lift up the covers and peek under to find Zahrah asleep on top of you, face buried in her claws
>You weren't complaining about having a short stack wolverine sleeping on you but you didn't want her to get the wrong idea
>You try shifting her slightly
>"Noooo comfy" she whines softly as you try
>Well this is your life now
>You are a living space heater
>You decide to stay put for the time being anyway
>The bed is comfy and warm and you had affection for the first time since your fiancé died from the sickness
>Plus you can sleep in, a quick look out a window showed the storm hit hard
>You were both snowed in
>So you drift back you sleep, placing your arms around Zahrah getting a soft sigh from her
>You guess she hasn't had this for a while, or might not have ever
>You fall back to sleep smiling
~~~~
>"Oi fucker wake up" 
>You awake with a start
>Zahrah has thrown off the blankets and is stomping around the cabin
>"What’s up?" you ask groggily
>"I need to piss and can't get outside" she says bluntly
>"Why did you need me then?" you ask as you pull on your leathers and mask
>"I needja to wade through the snow so I have a path to the outhouse!"
>God you missed indoor plumbing
>You look out the window 
>If the snow storm was Germany, it would be a fucking blitzkrieg
>Still it was better than having Zahrah wet herself, plus it would make things easier for you later when you needed to go
>"Alright, let's do this then" 
>You open the door and the winds push it open wide, the warm air sucked out by the cold
>The snow is waist deep to you but that's close to shoulder level for Zahrah
>No wonder she needed your help
>You push through with her close behind you, using you as a windshield
>You push through the snow slowly
>Trudging through the cold and snow.
>At least Zahrah had closed the door of the cabin behind her
>You finally reach the outhouse and push the snow out of the doors way
>She scampers inside
>God this sucked, your leathers were soaked and starting to freeze
>You needed to get back inside to strip down and let them dry but you couldn't just leave Zahrah
>You instead huddle by the side of the outhouse, protected from the wind
>She finally comes out
>"Anon?"
>"Right here" you say stepping out
>God, that wind sucks
>"Let's get back inside, we need to dry off" she says
>You nod and push back to the cabin 
>The snow made the 50 feet or so feel like miles
>You push open the cabin door finally and you both spill through
>"I'll chuck some wood on the fire" Zahrah says "get out of those cloths or you'll get hypothermia"
>You start to strip out of your soaked clothes and hang them near the fire
>You look at her
>She’s shivering, even though you made a path as best you could she still got a ton of snow caked into her fur
>You grab the blankets 
>"Come 'ere we need to warm you up Ze."
>You drape the blankets over your shoulders and sit down cross legged near the fire and invite her into your lap
>She walks over slowly and sits into you
>You shiver from the cold water on her but still keep the blankets open pointed towards the fire
>This causes the heat to funnel to you and her
>"It's been a long time since anyone cared about me" She says
>You look down; what caused this?
>She's looking into the fire as she talks, she's not talking to you, just talking, needing someone to listen
>"I’ve been out here almost my whole life, when I was born the humans who created me wanted to kill me cuz of my vision" she says absentmindedly
>"One human, a janitor or something, his job was to get rid of the unwanted like me. I guess he felt something for me because instead of killing me he brought me here and showed me how to survive" She continues
>"He died with the rest of your kind, I never got to say goodbye, he just said he had to go and....." she is just staring at the fire "He never came back"
>You sit there digesting everything she said
>"What about you Anon?" she's looking up at you, you notice she has deep hazel eyes
>Your turn to unload baggage you guess
>"I-I... I was born into a military family, everyone in my family served since World War 1, I was supposed to keep it going and when the draft came, and my parents were overjoyed..." You ramble
>"but... I ran... I never wanted to serve and it seemed unfair that I would have to fight for a cause I didn't believe in....I came back when the sickness hit. They all died... my friends... my family... my fiancée... everyone I ever knew and didn't know"
>tears are welling in your eyes
>"I tried to survive with everyone else; rebuild they said!" you're staring into the fire "the locusts came, I ran. I’ve been wandering ever since. I figured I was going to die alone so I headed to the last forest I knew of, might as well die surrounded by trees"
>"Why not try to find other humans? You could rebuild"
>"Humanity is dead. No need to sugar coat it, I could be the last or I could be a forgotten soul in the continued history, but either way I would rather just disappear like the ghost I’ve always been"
>You reflect on this statement
>You graduated high school, no one came to congratulate you
>College, you were a face in the crowd
>You always were no one, just another person dying inside
>And even now, after you left this place only one person, one thing would ever remember you
>A lone wolverine
>Your tears were flowing freely, you didn't even notice before.
>"I don’t think you’re no one Anon" 
>You're startled from your thoughts, you almost forgot she was there
>"You drop in from nowhere, trap me, free me, help me get more food than I would have in a season, help me stay warm, help me go piss....keep me warm during a blizzard..."
>You're looking at the fire, focusing on yourself and on the small bundle of fur in your lap
>This was the most welcome you had been in a long time
>Even those Anthro colonies or cities or whatever you wanted to call them just tolerated you
>The last human they would see
>The pity was tangible, they were so grossly trying to make sure you were comfortable, making sure that you had all you could want before the last remnant for humanity died
>But you refused every time, never staying long
>You helped them rebuild. Showed them metal working, at least the little you knew and moved on
>You felt like Mad Max in a way but you were not courageous
>You planned to reach the coast and set up, live until cancer or whatever came and killed you
>You didn't deserve such a peaceful death. You deserved the same as every other human
>Coughing up blood and choking on your own bile
>You snap back to reality. 
>She's cuddled into you
>You wrap your arms and the furs covering them around you both
>You're both looking at the fire, they call it survival TV for a reason
>The shape and forms it takes... They never really mean anything but...
>After a while they form what you think of.
>A forgotten memory
>A person you tired desperately not to forget the face of...
>You stomach growls breaking the trance between you both
>"Oh... we should eat“ She says calmly "I have more of that deer but I also have some quail and eggs from said quail"
>"Quail and eggs sounds good." 
>She gets out of your lap and stretches
>She pauses and turns to you
>"You aren’t no one Anon" she puts a clawed paw to your face
>"You helped everyone along the way. You taught them all you knew of how to make metal and even if your name and face is forgotten, they will remember the lone human that taught them."
>"But enough of that emotional shit! Let’s get some breakfast"
>You smile, food would be good. Even though it's only morning it's tough to focus
>Snow, darkness penetrated by only a fire, an inviting bed and company
>You were starved for anything social
>Its odd how before you thought you would be ok on your own
>Even before the war, you thought "even if the world ended tomorrow any only I survived I would be okay"
>Wandering the wastes of civilization, seeing the now crumbling skyscrapers
>You wouldn't be ok on your own, Zahrah had proven that
>But you were a guest, only here because you helped her find food
>She’s cooking now. The food she's making smelling great
>Well, let’s just enjoy it all for now

~~~ 

>It's been a few days the storm passed
>The snow isn't melting but still the winds have died down and the world is quiet again
>You and Zahrah have gotten to know each other pretty well
>After all there wasn't much to do besides talk to each other during the blizzard
>She wasn't used to company, but welcomed your talking and inputs on various things
>You dreaded the day you would have to go 
>So, you kept yourself busy
>hHlping Zahrah outside, staining your leathers black since you had time now 
>Pen ink and melted snow
>You didn't ask why Zahrah had a drawer full of pens 
>You go outside and look around 
>You can see the mountains to the north, a valley to the west, you had come from the east and nothing was that way
>You’ve chosen the path you'll go when you have to leave, back to wandering 
>Westward, follow the sun until your reach the ocean. Then wing it
>right now though, you're sharpening your spear on a whet stone
>Zahrah had taken an interest in your metal working
>You wished you could use the skill to help her, but how could you? 
>You had no scrap metal, no forge, and no anvil
>"A....Anon..." 
>You turn to her
>"I was wondering if you could.... make me some tools before you go" she says nervously, twisting one footpaw into the snow while looking down
>"I would love to Ze but I don't have any supplies here to do that" you say 
>You hated that you had to let her down
>"We can fix that!" she says with a short bounce
>She replied so suddenly it startled you a bit
>"Shere's a few abandoned towns around! I’m sure we could find what we need!" 
>"If you knew there were abandoned towns around why didn't you go scavenge them?” You say looking at her
>"Never needed to"
>She had a point
>"Well ok, fuck we can do that. We need something to load supplies into like a wagon" 
>"OH!" 
>She leads you around the backside of the cabin, you had never looked over here and never needed to 
>There's an old metal cart partly rusted but the tires look in good enough shape 
>It's only about 3 feet by 3 feet and waist high on you but it’s better than nothing
>"Alright then Zahrah, looks like your stuck with me till the snow melts away"
>She smiles at you, wiggling her ears gently
>"I’m ok with that" 
>You are as well, 
>You both head into the cabin 
>You are going to need to make a list of what you need
>Spring is here. The snow melted away, 
>You've been living with Zahrah for about a month now
>Or was it 2? You didn't really count the days
>You and Zahrah had gotten close
>Between her snuggling onto you every night (not that you were complaining) and her being close to nude most of the time, you were noticing her curves more and more
>Still you couldn't push that boundary
>Last thing you wanted is to ruin this
>You check your gear
>You can travel a lot lighter since you can leave most of your tools behind at the cabin
>Spear check
>Crossbow check,
>Compass check (Zahrah claimed you didn't need it because she could find her way back without it)
>Hunting knife, check
>It was time to get moving
>Apparently "Close by" meant the closest Town was about 10 miles away and the other about 5 or so miles from there
>It would take you almost the whole day to get there, so you had some furs and other items for setting up a camp
>"Ready?" you ask Zahrah
>"Ready!"
>You set off pulling the cart along behind you
>The sun was just beginning to rise
>It would take maybe 5 hours to get there, and you had plans to set up a camp before scavenging meaning you needed to make use of the daylight
>There were things you wanted to grab as well. 
>Things that would make living easier. Flashlights, batteries, lighters matches, little things you don't miss until you need them
>Zahrah is leading the way leaving you to pull the cart 
>She's chatty today as well 
>"I’ve never been to a human town before, I just never needed to and it wasn't like I was welcome" she was saying
>"And I don't like the idea of living near Anthros, I think that I would make the prey Anthros uncomfortable because I can only eat meat"
>You're just nodding and pulling along
>She suddenly stops. You look up past her and see the outskirts of the town, a weathered sign says "Sunnyvale"
>"I-I I’m scared Anon"
>You're taken aback, did she say she was scared? Of an empty town?
>You look at her
>"What’s up Ze?" you say as you walk up to her
>"The only humans I’ve met besides you and father tried to kill me, granted I’ve not met many"
>"And here's a place where they lived" she says looking up at you
>"Yea, but that's over now" 
>You reach around her and pull her close, her head at your stomach level
>"Let's find a building to set up in" you say rubbing her shoulder
>"Okay"
>You both are walking through the main street
>Grocery stores, cloths stores, restaurants, and the bank
>A bank would work, they are generally pretty secure and have heavy doors
>You point it out to Zahrah
>"Hmm ok, but if I smell anything funky we aren't staying there"
>You open the front doors to the bank, its cool inside and dark
>"Can you see Zahrah?" 
>"Yea my night vision is pretty good" she says walking into the dark
>You wait a bit for your eyes to get used to the darkness and then survey the scene
>A basic bank, you can see the counters and a few desks
>Zahrah is in the walk in safe
>"What's all this paper stuff?" she’s asks holding up a bunch of dollar bills
>"Money, we humans used to use it to get stuff" you explain
>"You traded paper for things?" she looks at you confused her tail swishing slightly
>"Yea, you would work a job and they would give you money that you could buy stuff with"
>She thinks a moment
>"That’s dumb" she says finally
>"Yea but its good kindling now" 
>You set up your sleeping mat behind the counter and set up a small fire pit in the safe 
>Hopefully it will radiate the heat outwards
>"Alright where to first Anon?"
>Tough question, scavenge food? Scavenge tools? Clothes? Raid houses? 
>"Let’s go to the local department store" 
>"What's that?" 
>"A store where they have all sorts of things"
>You both leave the bank and look around 
>This town wasn't a small town but still was big enough to get lost in 
>You needed to get a lay of the land and the internet wasn't a thing anymore for looking up maps
>"Let’s get on the roof to look around" you say to Ze
>She looks at you
>"Nope, I don’t do heights"
>Fair enough
>You walk back inside and look around, eventually you find the Storage closet with roof access
>You climb up and have to hit the hatch a few times before you can push it open with a sad defeated creak
>You look over the edge and see Zahrah looking up at you
>You wave
>Why did you wave you idiot?
>She laughs at your waving and just says "hi Anon" like she would be talking to a child
>Dammit
>You shake yourself out if that stupidity and look around
>You see a hardware store to the north and a Walmart to the west
>Ok west first 
>You climb back down and meet back with Zahrah outside
>"We're heading west" you say to her as you begin the walk, pulling the cart behind you
>It's about a mile or 2 to the store
>"Anon what are those" and "Anon what is this" 
>That's all you're hearing from Zahrah as you walk
>You explain everything along the way 
>After about an 45 minutes you reach the Walmart
>"You smell anything Ze?"
>She sniffs around a bit
>"Nah" she says
>Let's do this thing 
>You force open the sliding doors and walk in
>Again, you have to wait as your eyes get used to the dark
>You needed a light
>Signs
>The camping section
>You stumble around to the camping area and find a lantern and the batteries that go with it
>Let there be light
>You can see now 
>Zahrah is next to you looking at the lantern
>"What the fuck" she whispers staring at the light
>"What you've never seen electric lamps" you look at her 
>"No, I’ve lived my whole life in that cabin" she's still staring at the light
>You grab a shopping cart and start throwing every battery in reach into it, as well as a few flashlights
>You head to the gardening section.
>"Hey, why would I forge you tools when we can get them here?" you ask Zahrah
>"They have those?"
>Wow she has been sheltered or something like that
>You grab an Ax and hand it to her
>"Voila metal ax"
>"What the FUCK! You mean this stuff was here all along?!?" she says looking at her new tool
>"Well yea, what did you think humans did? Make stuff from hand?" you ask
>"You made that spear!" She yells at you!
>"People don't usually carry spears" you retort
>"Well, fuck me then" She says
>"Is that an invitation?" you ask
>"Shut up!" she punches your leg
>"Huh, come on, let's get you some actual clothes" 
>You go over to the kid’s cloths section and start picking through things
>"Why are you looking in the kids section?"
>"Cuz you're short"
>"And you're lanky, ya dumb fuck"
>"I like this" she says picking up a batman Shirt
>"Try it on then"
>She pulls off the cloth that is wrapped around her chest
>It was falling apart anyway
>She pulls on the batman shirt and it fits
>Barely
>Her breasts are pushing against the fabric and you can clearly see her nipples
>"I LIKE IT"! She says flicking her short tail around
>You grab some more shirts in that size
>You go over to the woman's underwear section
>She can’t wear pants cuz of her tail but you could probably get her to wear underwear 
>Her ass is big enough to fill normal underwear
>"Pick some out you like Zahrah" 
>She snoops around and grabs some underwear
>She then drops her loincloth and pulls them on
>They seem a bit small
>"Try a larger size"
>She picks another and pulls them on
>Perfect
>You grab more in that size
>You look at her
>She's adorable
>I mean how could you not like a short stack wolverine in a batman shirt and Panties?
>Alright, let's get you some cloths
>You grab some underwear and some shirts and a few pairs of shorts
>3 towels, some soap, you find crossbow bolts in the gun section
>No guns though but plenty of ammo
>You leave the Walmart, it's almost 3 judging by the suns position
>"Let's get to the hardware store" you say to her
>She nods and have her new ax over her shoulder like a lumberjack
>You pull your cart, now filled with goodies to the home Depot
>It’s a mile or so and it takes about 20 minutes
>You push the doors open and go inside 
>Ah home depot, so many useful things
>You grab a shovel and a hatchet 
>"What else do we need here Zahrah?" you ask her.
>"We should grab those things to sharpen our tools"
>You find the grinders and sharpening tools 
>You also grab a hand saw and several lengths of rope
>"Let’s head back to the bank and cook up some dinner" you say to Zahrah
>"Yea let’s go" she says happily
>You both head out and head back to the bank 
>It's nearly dark when you get there 
>Pulling the cart slows you down a bit
>Still it's a good haul
>You pull out one of the lighters you got from Walmart, and light up a pile of money and get the fire going
>"This is going to make our lives a lot easier" Zahrah Says to you looking into the fire
>"Yea it is, we can get good tools and supplies from the town"
>Wait did she say our lives?
>You look at her
>"A-anon, I want you to stay with me, life has been so much better with you around and--"She snaps to attention
>You know that look.
>You pull your crossbow off your back
>"What is it"
>"Wolves"
>"Fuck"
>You can't see them you turn the lantern on 
>You have the advantage
>You can shoot them with your crossbow and they should get bottlenecked through the door
>You get up and close one of the doors and wedge it shut
>Even if you closed both though, they would wait for you
>"How far are they" you ask her
>"Dunno" she has her ax ready
>You can hear them now stalking slowly
>You see the light reflect off eyes
>You aim and fire a bolt and are rewarded with a sharp Whimper and a soft thud
>One down
>You hear snarls and you reload 
>Suddenly 2 rush through the door and pounce at Zahrah
>She brings her ax down into one's head but the other is on her
>"FUCK YOUYOUFUCKIN WOLVES FUCKYOURMOMAND-" 
>You run over and impale the wolf with your spear 
>"Goddammit I just got this shirt!" 
>No time to mourn it
>You hear another and raise your crossbow
>You aim and fire another bolt and hear another whimper
>You hear scratches and the sound over nails on concrete
>They are running away 
>Maybe killing 3 of their pack made them think again
>Zahrah is still swearing about her shirt
>You look at her
>"Zahrah, you're bleeding!" you rush over to her
>"What? I am? Oh I am...” 
>Her shoulder has a deep slash in it
>Ok ok, you know how to fix this
>You think about your surroundings 
>There was a grocery store around the block
>That would have first aid stuff 
>Could you risk it? Zahrah was bleeding badly 
>You pull her shirt off her and press it into the wound
>You want to admire her body, but no time for that
>"Hold that there, I'm going to get some first aid stuff" you say to her "I saw a store around the block, I’ll be right back"
>"Will you be ok?" She says looking at you sadly
>"I'll be fine" you says as you pull your spear out of the wolf "I survived for a while alone"
>You pull her ax out of the other wolf and set it next to her
>You grab a flashlight and load it up with batteries
>You click it on and look out the door 
>There were no signs of the wolves other than the 1 that was dead with a crossbow in it 
>The other was whimpering and laying on the ground a bolt straight into the side of its neck
>Better put it out of its misery
>You stab your spear into the back of its neck and twist it 
>Its whimpers stop and its lays still
>Alright, to the store now
>You head in the direction you saw it 
>You find it shortly and try the door. 
>Locked. Fuck it
>You swing your spear like an ax and shatter the window of the storefront
>You climb through and head to the first aid section
>Neosporin, bandages, gauze, hydrogen peroxide, sewing kit, 
>You also grab a box of razors and shaving cream
>You go to the alcohol aisle and grab vodka as well
>You head back to the bank and are relieved to see Zahrah is still conscious
>"Ok this part is gonna hurt, and probably suck a lot" you say as you pull out the bottle of vodka
>You unscrew the lid and hand the bottle to her
>"Take a swig of this and let's get this started"
>"What is this" she says sniffing it and making a sour face
>"Drink it, it'll take some of the edge off" you say as you thread the needle 
>She takes a quick swig of it and retches "Oh god that shit burns! What the hell Anon!"
>"Its alcohol, don't worry" you shake the can of shaving cream
>Ok here we go
>You pull the shirt away from the wound slowly
>"This is gonna hurt a little bit" 
>You pour hydrogen peroxide into the gash and she winces slightly
>You then wipe it down with one of the towels 
>Then you spray shaving cream around it and shave the area around the gash
>"Hey what're you doin that for?" good the alcohol it kicking it a bit
>"I’m going to need to stitch this shut and your fur is going to get in the way" you tell her calmly
>Breathe
>Don't let your hands shake, she is depending on you
>You start sewing slowly, she's wincing but not complaining
>You finish up. 4 long inches of stitching
>You then put some Neosporin on it and place some gauze over it and tape it down
>"Alright, we're good to go Ze"
>"Thanks anon" 
>"Ze catch some sleep, I’m gonna stay up and keep watch as well as gut and skin those wolves we killed"
>She nods at you
>You grab one of her new shirts "arms up" she raises her arms slowly
>You pull her shirt down on her and walk her to the "bed"
>You tuck her in and bundle her up
>"I’m not going anywhere Ze, I’ll stay with you as long as you want me to" you say
>She smiles and nods drunkenly "s'good"
>Geez how big of a drink did she take?
>You look at the bottle
>Nearly 1/4th of it is gone
>What the fuck
>Whatever, you go and drag the 2 wolf bodies in the bank and get to work skinning and gutting them
>By the time you finish with all 4 the sun is coming up
>Zahrah Stirs gently in the bedding
>"Anon?" 
>"Yea" 
>"Let's go home"
>You smile at her and get to packing everything
>She's moving her arm around and feels the gauze with her paw
>"Didja have to shave me" She asks with a frown
>"Yes, I needed to so that I could close the wound up" you say and you throw some stuff in the cart
>"Hmpf fine"
>You both begin the walk back to the cabin
>"Hey Anon, let's grab more of that alcohol stuff" she says as you walk past the store
>you've created a monster
>"Ok let's grab some then we should get going" you say calmly, climbing through the window
>You reach over and pick her up and bring her into the store with you
>"Watch the hands" she says playfully
>"No"
>You go over and grab some more bottles of alcohol and head back to the cart 
>Pulling the cart is rough, you have over 300 Lbs. of wolf meat, a shit ton of tools and clothes as well as other random shit
>You both have to pull it to get it where it needs to go
>When you finally get to the cabin it’s almost nightfall
>You're tired
>You've been up all night, fought off wolves, got a bunch of gear, sewn up a short stack wolverine, and pulled a cart over 20 miles
>As soon as you park the cart, you start unloading it
>"Go rest Anon, I’ll handle this" Zahrah says putting a paw on your arm
>"No you won’t, you're going to tear your stitches and reopen that wound" you say as you pull the shovel and sharpeners off
>"But you can help me by getting the wolf meat out and cooking some up" 
>She huffs at you
>She's wearing a hello kitty shirt and red panties
>You smile.
>She starts unloading the meat and you finish putting away the tools then start carrying the clothes into the cabin
>After about an hour everything is put away and the wolf meat is ready
>The new skins are outside being stretched for tanning
>"Here ya go" she brings you a platter and sets into her own piece of meat
>You smile and start eating
>"You promise you're gonna stay Anon?" she says
>"I said I would"
>She smiles and you finish your food
>You strip down and hang your road leathers up
>Time to sleep
>You get into bed 
>God you're tired
>Zahrah gets in and snuggles up to you
>You smile and pull her close 
>"You're a great snuggle buddy" you say to her
>"So are you"
>You put your arms around her and then kiss her gently
>She seems surprised at first then kisses back
>You pull away and smile
>Her ears are flicking gently and he tail is wagging slightly
>"Goodnight Zahrah" 
>"Foodnight Anon"
>You both fall asleep in each other’s arms
~~~~
>You awake slowly, you're groggy still but you have to piss 
>You lay in bed, rubbing Zahrah, gently debating whether you should get up and pee or just stay in bed longer
>Your hands are creeping down Zahrah’s back and you rub her tail and ass gently
>You get a happy sigh from her
>Eventually you need to get up and go
>You gently shift her off your chest getting a soft "nooooo"
>You throw on some shoes and go outside.
>Fuck it you aren't going to the outhouse
>You stomp over to the nearest tree and relieve yourself 
>You shiver a bit from the cool morning air 
>You finish up and head to the cabin
>Zahrah is up now and is cooking 
>"What's cooking?" you ask walking over to her
>"Some deer meat, we need to go hunting again" 
>"But we just got those wolves" 
>"Yea but we should stockpile while its spring, that winter storm we had last season was pretty mild compared to previous years"
>You couldn't argue with that logic, besides she was more used to this mountain living
>"Hey Ze, I'm gonna pump in some water for a bath, alright?"
>"You don't need my permission stupid"
>You laugh and head to the water pump and begin pumping in water
>It's freezing cold, so it has to go into the boiler and get warm and that will take a while, you'll probably have to wait till the end of the day for it to be ready
>You pump in water for about 40 minutes and light the fire under the boiler and stoke it
>Zahrah opens a window "Hey food's ready"
>You head inside and eat with her
>"Zahrah lets go set some traps we should be able to catch some small game"
>"Ok, while we're at it we can look for deer or moose"
>You haven't had moose before but you were willing to try anything
>You get into your clothes and grab your crossbow and spear as well as rope and other trapping gear
>Zahrah just grabs her ax
>"How did you hunt with only that ax?"
>"I usually just would sneak up on animals and give them a good whack" she says while making a swinging motion
>You both head out and set up some traps on known deer trails and well as along trees for squirrels
>Then you hear it
>A motor 
>Zahrah hears it too and is sniffing the air.
>You crouch down 
>"What direction" you whisper
>"Northeast"
>You pull out and load your Crossbow 
>It's getting closer
>Then suddenly an ATV bursts through the brush. You reel back and pull Zahrah with you 
>An Anthro fox is sitting on the ATV Looking stunned
>"Whoa" he says simply 
>Zahrah is up and pissed "WHOA? WHOA?!? THAT’S ALL YA CAN FUCKIN SAY AFTER NEARLY FUCKIN RUNNING US OVER YA CUNT!"
>He shrinks back from the verbal onslaught 
"Uh uh sorry, I didn't know anyone lived out here the nearest colony is like 40 miles away"
>He looks at you
>"And you're a human! There are humans there too!" 
>What
>"That's all well and good" you say "But what are you doing here? We’ve been setting traps for hours and you could have just scared off all our game"
>"Oh yea uhh sorry?" he says shrinking back ears folded flat
>You were more interested in the ATV he was riding though
>"Where didja get that ATV?" you ask him
>"Oh this? We found some old beat up ones in a town and restored them! Well I mean we just put batteries in them and changed the fluids"
>You could use an ATV that would make your and Zahrah’s lives easier
>"We?" Zahrah says
>You might be able to get her glasses at the colony
>"Me and my buddies! Oh I'm Herald by the way"
>"I’m Anon and this is Zahrah" you say 
>"Cool, I’ll take you to our camp!"
>He leads the way, after about 20 minutes you hear more voices
>People laughing and joking
>"Hey guys! I met some people who live up here! One of them is a human" Herald calls out
>You come out of the tree line to a clearing where a small RV is parked
>There are 3 Anthros around a small fire
>A rat, a dog and another fox
>"Oh neat, ask them where we can get some beer!"
>You frown
>The first people you meet that have vehicles are frat boys
>"Hey she's pretty cute!" the rat says looking at Zahrah
>"Look we just wanna know where we can get an ATV and where the Colony is" You say
>"What will you give us for that info then" snickers the fox
>Zahrah growls "We could just kill you and take your ATVs"
>God dammit, she can be intimidating even though she so small
>The grin disappears from the foxes face and he looks like he wet himself
>Their eyes go from her to you, to your spear, to your loaded crossbow
>"Of course, We don't want that" you say with a shrug "We just asked a simple question and you gave a stupid answer" 
>The rat clears his throat, "Ahem well uhh, we don't know where you could get an ATV, we found ours in an abandoned house...Sir..."
>The fox spoke up next "The colony is about 40 or 50 miles south of here"
>He goes into the RV and comes out with a folded map
>He points it out for you
>"Hm... Mind if I take this map?" you ask politely
>"Uhh yea sure"
>"Well then gentlemen, we will take our leave" you say "Oh and there's a town east of here with a few liquor stores, you'll find beer there" 
>You turn away from them and walk away
>Zahrah follows you 
>"See ya herald" you say as you walk past him
>You head home
>"Anon we should go to the town again tomorrow and try to find one of those vehicles! We might be able to get a generator here and have power!" 
>Her ears are flicking excitedly
>You smile at her
>"Yea, but we have to find one first"
>"We'll head there tomorrow at sunup and pack for a few night stay"
>The sun is starting to set
>Oh man your bath will be ready
>You head inside and start the water going in the tub, the water steams gently
>You strip down and ease your way into the water
>Ooo this felt good on your tired bones
>"Make room for me" Zahrah opens the door and climbs in
>"H-hey! Come on Ze!"
>"Hush you! I deserve a good soak too!"
>You sigh
>She's naked and sitting between your legs, her little tail swishing in the water
>You grab the shampoo and get to washing her fur
>"Ahhh" she groans happily
>You work your fingers into her fur, massaging gently
>She's snuggles up onto you 
>You grab a small cup and pour warm water over her head and wash her head and muzzle gently
>She's washing her legs and arms
>You reach around her and start washing her stomach 
>"Mmmm higher Anon"
>You put your hands on her breasts and give them a quick squeeze before washing her gently
>"Mmmm yea that's it" she says 
>"Now down there" She directs you
>You move your hand down her fur starts getting thinner 
>You slide a finger past her lips and rub gently
>"Mmmm yea Anon just like that"
>You rub a little harder and search for her clit
>You find it and rub in a circular motion
>She’s pushing her ass onto you and is grinding on you
>You in turn, rub faster than push a finger into her pussy making her gasp slightly
>Your right hand is fingering her and you left starts squeezing and groping her breasts
>Shivers and gasps
>"Ohh god Anon harder"
>You don't need another invitation
>You push a second finger into her and use your thumb on her clit 
>She shudders and kicks her legs slightly
>She pants
>"H-holy hell, anon that was the best o-orgasm I’ve had"
>She shudders more looking up into your eyes
>She's still grinding on you and smiling
>She lifts herself gently and positions your member against her and slowly slides herself down onto you
>Her pussy feels better than anything you've felt before, warmer than the hot water around you and slightly pulsing with spasms 
>She gasps and shudders and sits still on you for a moment
>"It's bigger than I thought it would be" she says as she grinds side to side 
>Her walls wrap around your member and are tight
>So so tight
>You grab her around the waist gently and start moving her up and down, getting a cascade of soft moans from her
>She helps now, moving herself and using the side of the tub as leverage 
>She's moving slowly, savoring the feeling of you in her 
>You savor being in her just as much 
>Neither of you has had release for a while
>The slow build up from her moving is intoxicating
>You put your hands back on her ample waist and assist her moving
>You slowly speed up 
>She Gasps and shudders looking up at you
>Her insides tighten quickly as her legs go straight and twitch slightly
>You keep pumping into her and feel close
>"Do it inside me Anon, Kiss me" she moans
>You force her down hard onto your cock and you buck upwards and you explode into her
>You lean down and kiss her as you continue to spurt in her
>"That was amazing Zahrah" you say as you wrap your arms around her
>"If you think that was fun wait till I go into heat this summer" she says has she slowly lifts herself off of you, your now half flaccid cock slides out 
>Oh boy
>You relax back and she leans into you, both of you relax in the afterglow and the warm water
>After a bit the water starts to get cold and she climbs out of the tub and you follow
>You wrap a towel around her and grab another for yourself 
>You dry off much quicker than she does, so you throw a few logs onto the fire and usher her by it so she can dry quicker
>You let her sit by the fire and pull out a few steaks for dinner
>You throw them on the stove, she likes her rare, you prefer medium
>You pull hers off and put it on a plate for her and bring it to her 
>She's been watching you and smiling the whole time
>"Lucky me, I got the human that cares about a little wolverine like me" she says as you set the steak next you her 
>You smile and give her a kiss
>"Lucky me, I caught a wolverine in a trap and she still loves me" you respond with a smirk
>"Shut up!" she playfully punches you
>You go get your food and sit next to her
>You both eat quietly, enjoying the company 
>You finish your meal and put a hand on her paw
>"I’m glad you asked me to stay Zahrah, but even before you asked, I didn't want to leave" you confess to her "I was only going to leave if you wanted me to"
>"I didn't want you to, and I never want you to anon" she responds looking into your eyes
>"Well now you're stuck with me" you say playfully as you squeeze her paw gently
>"Now let's get to bed, we have a long day tomorrow and will need the energy"
>You get up and offer her a hand to help her up, which she gladly takes
>You get into the bed and lay on your back
>She takes her usual position of laying on your chest, snuggling her muzzle into your neck and letting out a content sigh
>You pull the covers over you both and wrap your arms around her and you both drift off to sleep
Next day
>The preparation to go town this time around was quicker, and you can get there much faster because you aren't pulling a cart
>The walk was only a bit slow because Zahrah can't walk at the same you can
>"Quit walking so fast ya lanky fuck!"
>"This is how I normally walk you munchkin!"
>"You and your goddamn trees for legs!"
>This was the whole walk, filed with friendly insults and bickering 
>You still arrive to the town after a little over 3 hours
>You need to find the residential areas 
>After about 20 minutes, Zahrah gets your attention
>"Hey, anon, what are those" she points
>There were graves covering what was easily 50 acres on a mountain
>You weren't able to see them before because of a hill that was in front of it and your lower elevation
>"Those are Graves Ze" you say solemnly
>"Graves? You mean each of those are a person?" She asks
>"Maybe more to save space" 
>She looks at you wide eyed "but there are so many"
>You nod
>"Billions died" you say to her, still looking at the graves
>You’re pulled from your trance as she hugs you around the waist
>"I’m glad you didn’t" she says
>"Me too" you say with a smile
>About 20 minutes later you find some houses
>Ok time to have to look in the garages and scavenge more
>The first few houses give nothing
>You bash through the door of one and Zahrah recoils
>"What's wrong"
>"Something died in here"
>You're pretty sure you knew what 
>You had already felt this and knew what to expect
>You walk in and Zahrah reluctantly follows
>You walk up the stairs and into a room
>There they were
>Looks like a couple decided to end it themselves
>You see the pills and booze they took 
>They died in each other’s arms
>You grab a blanket and cover them, so it looks like they are tucked in
>"You've seen this before?" Zahrah asks
>"A few times yea" you answer
>"The sickness came and everyone got sick, almost everyone died but some decided to just end it rather than suffer"
>She looks at you
>"You caught it?"
>"Yea, instead of killing me, it just made me sick for a few days" you look down "I watched everyone I ever knew die, while I just kinda sat there watching"
> You leave the room and close the door behind you
>"I hope whatever religion you believed in is true and you're together" you say placing a hand on the door
>"A-anon? Did you have a human mate?" Zahrah asks you
>"Why do you ask Ze?" 
>"I never had a mate before you and I'm curious, I want to know your past"
>" I did, before it all went to hell, she… She died with everyone else"
>You go to the garage and spot a gun rack
>You never bothered with a gun before but you knew how to clean and maintain them
>You find a SRM 1216 revolving shotgun
>Score! These things were like 1200 bucks and could hold like 16 rounds
>You also find a Glock 40 and stash it 
>You would (hopefully) be able to get Zahrah some glasses and then teach her to shoot
>"Anon there's a shed thing in the back" 
>You follow to where you heard Zahrah and there is indeed a shed and a trailer used to transport vehicles
>Hm it’s locked, whatever
>You can just smash the connectors
>You go back to the garage hoping that they have a good tool for it
>There's a sledgehammer in the corner
>Why do they have a sledgehammer? Maybe ice buildup?
>You don't care but you thanked the dead man inside the house for his outdoorsiness and hoped he kept an ATV stashed in this shed
>You Bring up the Hammer and swing and smash the lock connectors
>After a minute of intense work the metal plates are mangled and torn from the door
>The walls were so flimsy that you could have just go through them like the fucking Kool-Aid man
>But you opened it and you had to thank the dead man once again
>There is was an ATV
>Dusty and forgotten for years, but it was there and had been protected from the weather
>Zahrah jumps excitedly
>"We found one!" she says swishing her tail
>"Yea, this couple gave use a ton of good stuff."
>Zahrah looks at you "Do you think we should bury them anon?"
>You think for a moment
>What would you have wanted
>"No" you say distantly lost in thought "They chose to die where they are, together and in each other’s arms, to disturb them would be..."
>"Wrong" Zahrah finishes the sentence for you
>You nod.
>Enough sad shit
>You go to the fence and smash the wooden frame that had a lock on it
>"Alright then Love, let's get to pushing this thing to that Walmart"
>Zahrah smiles and flicks her ears and you 
>"Aww you called me love" 
>You roll your eyes 
>"Come on, don’t get all mushy yet"
>You go in the house and look around 
>Key rings, you needed keyrings
>There was a key rack by the door so you grab them all
>You keep checking keys till you find one that fits and give it a turn
>Nothing
>You weren't surprised
>"Oi munchkin, get up here and steer while I push"
>"Fuck you Anon!" is her response
>"Seriously though I need you to steer" you say as you shift it to neutral
>"You know I can see for shit Anon"
>"Yea well, we'll be going at the speed of Anon pushing a 500 lb. machine, I’m sure you can handle the high speeds"
>"Fine"
>She get on the ATV and you take the chance to squeeze that glorious ass
>She squeaks in surprise and looks back at you
>"Don't start what you can't finish" 
>"Oh I can finish it better than Dio tried to finish Jojo"
>"What?"
>Godammit Jojo memes
>"Nothing just steer"
>"Ok, what way am I going?"
>After about an hour of pushing you reach the front of the Walmart 
>Another half hour to get the ATV inside
>You are laid out tired
>Zahrah is setting up a room in one of the manager offices for you both to sleep in
>You take a swig of water and rub your face
>Ok so you had it here pull the battery, flush the fluids, fill the tires and get fuel. Easy right?
> "Ok anon we are all set!" she's cooking a few pieces of meat over the fire
>"Hey Zahrah do you like seafood?"
>"What?"
>"Like fish and stuff" 
>"Never had it"
> You were going to have to change that, seafood was awesome
>But you were too tired right now, your body screamed at you for pushing that ATV so far and so long
>You manage a quick bite of food Zahrah prepared before she put out the fire at your request
>You didn't want to risk burning down the building.
>So you were going to have to share warmth together under the covers with Zahrah
>You snuggle into the makeshift bed and she snuggles into you
>You have one arm around her and one hand on her ass and she snuggles into your chest and neck
>You remember a song by the Gorillaz
>"If heaven has a VIP, this is it"
>The rest of the song or words don't matter
>The next few days are spent opening up the ATV, Clearing lines, replacing fluids
>You walk to the local gas station with a few gas canisters, Zahrah following you closely
>"Why do we need this stuff?"
>"It’s a combustion engine" you explain
>"This gasoline we are going to get is combustible and acts as the catalyst"
>You didn't know much about how cars work but you knew enough of them to know how to replace parts and such
>You arrive at the gas station and go to one of the manholes in the parking lot
>You open it with a wrench and are hit with the smell of gasoline
>You always enjoyed that smell
>But this part is going to suck
>Literally
>You get a piece of hose and drop it into the fuel and bring the other side to you lips
>You starts to siphon it up and after a few second the fuel reaches your mouth and sprays in a bit
>you cough and spit out the liquid 
>You put the now flowing fuel into one of the gas canisters
>Ugh that was disgusting
>You look at Zahrah
>"I am not kissing you till you get rid of that smell in your mouth" she says
>You smile and head to the gas station 
>Mouthwash, it would have mouthwash in the convenience store
>You open the door and search around
>You find some and take a swig and rub some on your lips
>Minty fresh
>You go back out and swap the containers for fuel
>"Much better" Zahrah says to you as she walks over and snuggles into you
>You hug her and sit down, she sits into your lap 
>"Hey Anon why is all this stuff open? Or everything just laying around? Or just you know, here? Don’t humans care about stuff?”
>"It's all open because no one was here to close it up or pick up anything. A few Major cities were taken by Anthros and colonies were built up around towns but in these town everyone is just dead"
>"We were sure we were all going to die, so we just left it for Anthros" you say
>She puts a paw to your face and kisses you
>"I’m glad you aren't dead"
>"Me too" you smile 
>The containers are full so you close them
>"Let's get back to the ATV, it should be good to go" you say to Zahrah
>"You mean it works!?" she says bouncing on her feet
>"Probably"
>You arrive at the Walmart and fill up the ATV with fuel
>Moment of truth
>You turn the key and are greeted with a RRRRRRRRRR as it tries to start
>You punch they gas while it’s going and it starts up
>Victory!
>Zahrah Is Overjoyed and quickly jumps on "I’m driving!"
>"No you're not, you blind midget, you don't even know how!"
>She grumbles and scoots back to let you on 
>"Nope you're sitting in front of me"
>You get on with her between your legs, the back of her head on your chest
>"Ahhh I like this" she says
>You hit the gas and do a quick lap around the building
>Zahrah is laughing "We're so fast!"
>You pull back into the building.
>"Come on babe, lets load up and head home, we need to build a shed or something at home to house this too"
>She gets off and you grab her gently and give her a big hug
>You then grab her ass and kiss her
>"Hey now why the mushy stuff?" 
>"I appreciate you and am glad I'm here with you, that's all"
>You break from the hug and get to packing
>Doesn't take long you pack everything onto the ATV and get driving
>Fuck you missed driving!
>The trip that would normally take hours of walking took about 20 minutes to get to the cabin
>"Fucking hell this is awesome" Zahrah says snuggling back into you
>"Yea it is" you say as you park the ATV and start unloading it
>"Come here I need to change those bandages and look at your wound" you beckon her over
>She sighs and walks over
>She's wearing rainbow panties and a nirvana shirt
>You tried to convince her to wear pants but she refuses saying they feel weird on her fur
>"Ok arms up" she lifts her arms and you pull her shirt off her exposing her Breasts and the bandages on her shoulder
>God she's adorable. you resist groping her though
>You peel the bandages off her wound
>Her cut isn't infected and is healing well, although it'll leave a scar covered by her fur
>"I think we can leave the bandages off now" you say to her with a slight kiss
>She puts her hands on her hips and shakes herself a little causing her breasts to jiggle
>She enjoys teasing you
>"Don't start what you can't finish" you say as you watch her boobs jiggle in front of you
>She then kisses you and starts pushing you into the cabin 
>She's strong as fuck for her size
>She then literally picks you up and throws you on the bed
>She's on you now waving her rainbow panties in your face
>"Get these out of my way" she play growls at you, pulling your pants 
>You take them off and she pulls off your undergarments
>"Ooo I always forget how big it gets" she whispers and rubs your member with her paw
>You can feel her hot breath on you 
>She's wagging her tail slightly
>She begins to lick your cock and breathes heavily
>She then takes you into her mouth and begins sucking your member,
>She wraps her tongue around you as she sucks gently 
>Not to be outdone you grab her ass and pull her pussy to your mouth
>She gasps as your tongue hits her panties and licks her through them
>You pull the panties off her and get back too licking her wetness
>She's gasping and moaning on your cock , too overstimulated to do anything but gently rub it with her paw
>You lick her clit in a circular motion getting moans and shivers
>You can see her asshole quivering with each shiver
>She sits up onto your face and is rubbing the your chest, your mouth is buried in her wetness as she rocks back in forth on you
>You can't see much beyond her back and her tail swishing 
>She starts shivering widely and shuddering before her legs clamp down on your head 
>Her claws dig into your chest 
>You continue lick and prodding her with your tongue before she gasps out a quick "ahhh"
>"A-Anon stop stop" she gasps
>You relent and she rolls herself off you
>She's breathing heavily
>"How...How did you do that with your tongue? That was amazing" She pants out 
>You shrug and sit up admiring her small body
>She grabs your arm 
>"We aren't done yet" she says eyeing your full erection
>She slides herself over to the side of the bed 
>"Get over here"
>You obey and stand on the ground facing her, 
>She's on her back on the bed looking up at you eagerly
>You smile and lean over her and give her a deep kiss, tracing your tongue along her fangs and wrestling with her tongue
>Still kissing, you position your member against her slit and push in slowly
>She moans into your mouth 
>You stand back up and pull out of her slightly
>Then thrust back in 
>You continue thrusting feeling her tight walls quiver
>You bring her legs together and place them against your chest
>She’s shivering and panting, her eyes rolled back slightly and her tongue drooping out of her open mouth
>You grab her wrists and start pulling her into your thrusts reaching deeper into her 
>"Ze you're amazing" you stammer, pounding hard against her
>Her walls clench down hard on you and you feel her legs shivering against your chest
>She’s orgasming hard on you and that pushes you to the edge as well
>With one last thrust you push deep into her womb and erupt
>You hold yourself there in her for a minute or so before gently pulling out
>You then lay on the bed next to her
>She's still quivering slightly and has her eyes closed
>"Ho...Holy fuck....What...Where did that come from anon" she stammers, rolling onto your chest and looking into your eyes
>"You're sexy as fuck and we've been so focused on getting the ATV running, we haven't had time to have any real fun"
>She's snuggled against you, you hold her tight
>You bask in the glow and fall asleep together
~~~
>The next day you hook up the cart to the ATV and Drive back to Walmart and grab all the ammo you can 
>You don't know what currency they use but assume it isn't bottle caps
>So, you would trade whatever ammo you couldn't use for anything you might want to keep. 
>You kept the 12 gauge and solid slugs for your new shotgun and the .40 rounds for the glock 40
>Everything else was fair game 
>As far as you knew, they wouldn't be totally hostile to a human and a small wolverine riding into town on and ATV looking like a goddamn bloodborne hunter
>But you weren't going without your spear and you weren't going without the shotty
>"This all we need anon?" Zahrah looks at the ammo in the cart
>"I think so, I don't know what money they use at the colony and I’m sure they need ammo. We can at least trade for whatever"
>You hop on the ATV and Zahrah climbs on top
>You rev the engine and get going
>You drive at a quick but leisurely pace to the area on the map the Fox had shown you 
>Zahrah holds the map and you drive
>After about 2 hours of driving you can see the outskirts of the colony
>It's basically a small town that some Anthros decided to settle into
>As you rode down the middle of the street, you're getting all sorts of stares
>You chuckle
>"We must look like a circus sideshow" you say to Zahrah
>"A what?" 
>"Never mind"
>You head to what looks like the town market hoping to find someone you can talk to
>They find you instead
>"Whoa there Human" a tough looking grizzly Anthro is walking up to you
>"We don’t mind your kind around here, but a Human riding into town with enough ammo to arm a militia is a cause for concern" he says looking down on you
>"Hey we can come into town and trade, can’t we?" Zahrah days before you even had a chance to respond
>The Bear seems startled "I didn't know humans raised Anthros anymore"
>"I’m full grown fuckface!" Zahrah snaps at him
>He cringes, realizing his faux pas 
>"Sorry there little lady, I didn't mean offense" He extends a paw to you "I'm Hank, the closest thing we have to a sheriff"
>You shake his Paw 
>"I’m Anon and this is Zahrah" you introduce yourself
>"We heard there was a colony here and figured we could trade ammo since we don't have money" you explain
>"Well I don't know about trading but I’m sure "the gun rack" over there will buy it from you" he points out a small building with a hand painted sign
>"As for things you need I might be able to point you in the right direction, least I can do for newcomers"
>"She needs glasses" you say, "Can anyone around here can do that?"
>"Hmmm I think the doc can help with that, he's one of the other humans around" Hank says thoughtfully, scratching his chin "you can find him in that building there" 
>He points to what looks like it used to be an old mall. 
>Nice
>You thank him and pull up to the gun rack
>Zahrah stays on the ATV 
>You head inside
>A small bell rings and you hear a gruff “I’ll be right there" from the back of the building
>A male hyena walks out, he's about 7 ft. tall 
>He stops when he sees you and rubs his eyes
>"Another goddam human, great" he scowls at you
>Typical
>"I got pointed this direction by Hank" you explain "I have ammo to sell and he said I should stop here"
>"Fuckin Hank" he spits "Fine let's get this over with, how much you got? a box? A few shells?"
>"Actually more like a lot of everything, it’s outside on my ATV" you say heading to the door
>He notices your shotgun 
>"That’s a nice gun ya got there, looking to trade?" 
>"The shotgun ain’t for sale this is" you open the door and show him the ammo haul
>His mouth drops open "where didja get all this?" 
>"Found it" Zahrah says 
>His eyes snap to her and then to you
>"Yer together?" he asks her
>"Yep got a problem with that" she asks her eyes narrowed
>"Uhmm, naw...." he says finally
>"How much you want for all this" he asks finally
>"Uh...” you hadn't thought about this 
>You knew nothing of conversion rates 
>You didn't even know what the currency was called
>Luckily Hank walks over 
>"You treating those folks well Zedd?" he asks
>"Yea, he is Hank" you answer for him "but I'm unsure of how much I can get for all this, this you can give me a hand?"
>"I'd be happy to Anon now I'm pretty sure all this is worth at least 500 units
>Zedd’s ears go flat "That's more than I make in a month" he says 
>you sigh "look I don’t need credits or units or whatever you call them" 
>"I just want enough to get glasses"
>Zedd perks up a bit
>"For really good ones you only need like 50 units" he says 
>"Fine, I’ll sell you 75 units worth for 50, as a measure of good faith" you say to him
>Hank seems to approve of this
>Zedd grabs about 10 boxes of 9mm ammo and 10 boxes of rifle ammo (you don't know rifle calibers)
> You follow him into the store and he pulls out a stack of papers
>"Paper money?" you ask taking the stack
>"We couldn't figure out a good way to make a currency so we just stuck with what you humans did" he explains
>Hm cool
>"If I ever need to sell more ammo I’ll come to you then Zedd"
>He smiles "good business for me then"
>"See ya then" 
>You leave the store 
>Zahrah is talking to Hank about the cabin and where you came from
>You hate to interrupt
>Eventually Zahrah notices you and gives you a quick hug
>Hank smiles
>"Thanks for the Help Hank" you thank him extending your hand
>"No problem Anon, stay out of trouble"
> You now head to the strip mall and drive inside
>You find "the doc" easily enough
>He's the only other human
>"Doc?" you say walking up to him
>He looks over and smiles 
>"My word, another human" he shuffles over and grabs your hand shaking vigorously 
>He’s old, Very old
>Well into his 70s at least
>"Been too long since we had a new human in the colony"
>"Ah well we aren't staying. We heard you can make glasses" you say
>"Ah yes I can, do you need glasses young man?" he asks shuffling over to a store in the mall
>"I don't but she does" you say gesturing to Zahrah
>"My what a cute little wolverine" he says shuffling over and adjusting his glasses
>He’s studying her face 
>"Hm yes I can do that, rare to find a fully mature wolverine Anthro around" he says shuffling to an eye tester
>Zahrah looks confused
>"Why is it rare to find Wolverines?" she asks
>"Aside from the fact that your kind is reclusive, Sit here dear" he says pointing to a chair
>She climbs up
>"As well, they were used as berserkers in the war, very good fighters" he continues
>"Most just stayed there after humanity died"
>He’s clicking think and asking if she can see this, read the letter
>This goes on for an hour or so
>"Dear dear, you're extremely nearsighted" 
>"The glasses will take about a week or so and cost 40 units", he looks at you "Do you need time to get the money together? I know 40 is a lot to ask for"
>"Nope, here" you hand him the stack of notes 
>Se looks shocked for a moment 
>"Ah very good then" he shuffles to a desk and puts the notes away
>"Come back in a week or so, they will be ready then"
>You hop onto the ATV and Zahrah climbs on
>"That went well" she says 
>"It did" you agree
>Head back the the cabin now
~~~
>It's been a year since Zahrah got her glasses
>She hated them at first, but you convinced her to wear them
>You gotten a windmill hooked to the house for power
>An electric water heater small thing you missed
>But all you needed was Zahrah
>And all she needed was you
>You both are happy together and that meant more than anything in the world
>Humanity might be dead but you weren’t and you weren't going anywhere
