> Be Anon.
> Going to a family wedding, the bride is your cousin and you are one of the few relations on her side attending.
> Raining outside so mood is poor.
> Its an outside service...
> Losing will to live, until...
> Bride rocks up in a horse drawn carriage.
> Its being pulled by an anthro mare, she's one of the bridesmaids and is wearing a tight-fitting teal dress.
> She suggested it as a joke, but is now regretting the offer since she's been soaked in the rain.
> Everyone is fussing around the bride, making sure her dress is ok etc, but bridesmaid is ignored, left still strapped into carriage.
> Being the gentleman you are, you head on over and offer to help.
> She's a mix of hot and sweaty, wet and chilly, and now flustered.
> You take your sweet time unstrapping her, allowing your fingers to linger just long enough to make her shiver slightly, but not long enough to be gropey.
> She's taller than you, more solidly built than you, and could easily make you stop... but she doesn't.
> She instead bites her lower lip, and squirms slightly against your touch, but doesn't pull away.
> Soon you are finished, leaving her free, and blushing furiously.
> Her absence has finally been noticed and the bride calls for her maid.
> With a wink, she jogs off, leaving you with the lingering sensation of her on your fingertips, and the subtle hint of her perfume on the breeze.
> You are now looking forward to the reception, far more than you were earlier...

> The service went a little better than planned, with the venue setting up some gazebos over the lawn where the party was set up.
> The bride and groom knelt in front of the priest, the parents wept, the kiddies bawled...
> You however, only had eyes for one particular bridesmaid.
> Someone had sorted her with a towel, some hair care products and a brush, but her dress was still wet.
> She stood dutifully behind the bride, fulfilling her role despite her soggy disadvantage.
> Yet her eyes kept darting away from their assigned place, and scanning the crowd around her.
> Scanning for you.
> When her nervous gaze met yours, the blush returned.
> Even as she looked away, and back again a second later, your eyes never faltered.
> She did her best to stay composed, but you could see she was nervous.
> Her long chestnut tail, braided silk, stopping but an inch from the ground, twitched and swayed.
> Her rippling flank was beaded with moisture, giving the impression of still being wet from the rain.
> But you knew better.
> As the couple exchanged their vows proper, the ceremony ended, and the cars arrived to take everyone to the reception.
> You were in one of the bum cars, with the nobodys and randoms.
> But as you walked past the car carrying the bridal procession, you saw her waiting.
> You winked this time, and granted her a knowing smile.
> She blushed in response, and flicked her tail.
> With only a quick glance around for witnesses, she bent over and began climbing into the car.
> To your happy surprise, her skirt hitched up, and quite deliberately too, revealing a notable lack of panties.
> Before she disappeared into the car, she winked at you again, but not with her eyes...
> The reception now beckoned like the flame to the moth, and you practically skipped to the old banger full of uncles and nobodies.
> There was a very special wedding celebration waiting...

> The reception had been booked for a fancy hotel function room, random waist-coated guys serving booze and canapés...
> Yet you had a different treat in mind.
> It wasn't to be though.
> The bride and her entourage sat at the front, while everyone else made do with their assigned seating arrangements.
> The bridesmaid even had a change of clothes.
> You sat through speeches and more, family members congratulating the happy couple and themselves for paying the way...
> What window had been available for you to close in on your mare seemed to be non existent...
> Until you had been asked to lend a hand with something...

> The booze had started to run dry, family and friends, previously catching up and getting on, had started to turn on one another.
> One of the fitter bridal party members had been asked to go find another crate but not returned...
> So you headed to the basement to find them...

> Down below you found a fine sight.
> A certain someone had tried to pull a crate of wine from a stack and gotten trapped, an overhanging shelf having fallen and trapping her in place.
> It was the mare bridesmaid, her front trapped with the crate, while her rear sat sticking into the dank air of the basement.
> It only took a moment for you to make yourself known.
> "My, my, what a predicament you seem to be in my dear... Is there something I can do to help?"
> She recognized your voice immediately.
> "W-well... could you try pushing and pulling a bit? Just until I can pry myself loose?"
> With a smile, you set about following her request.
> Her wide flank shuddered under your grasp, your hands sinking slightly into the toned muscle displayed before you.
> It wouldn't be possible to help her properly without a proper anchor point, but thankfully she had already provided.
> You hitch up her pretty dress and expose your prize.
> Under her twitching tail, you found her uncovered pussy, dripping wet and waiting for you.
> You consider taking things slowly, of having a bit of fun teasing her now that she was truly at your mercy. 
> But you could hear the hubbub upstairs from here, and you knew it wouldn't be long until another search party was sent in search of the booze...
> So you free your rock hard erection from your pants and place the tip firmly up against her waiting slit, giving her fair warning of your intent.
> She shudders once more, and you hear her voice drift up from among the boxes shakily.
> "B-be gentle... I-it's my first time..."
> This is something of a surprise considering how forward she's been with you, but...
> You lean forward and whisper your response, just loud enough for her to hear.
> "No, sorry."
> Then without waiting for a response, you slap her quivering rump solidly and plunge yourself deep inside of her.
> She let out a surprised whinny as you hilted yourself, your hips slapping against her moistened flank wetly.
> You stood there for a moment, enjoying the strange sensation of your first mare pussy.
> It was hotter than you expected, and her quivering folds seemed to grip at your length, hungrily trying to pull as much of you in as they could.
> Your helpless bridesmaid was struggling to keep her footing, her hooved feet clattering against the stone floor as she adjusted to you.
> This wasn't a time for peaceful contemplation though.
> You slowly pull back, savoring how her snatch seemed to only reluctantly release your length inch by suckling inch.
> You feel her hold her breath as you pause with only your tip inside... and then hear her moan heartily as you thrust back home.
> The urge to just start pumping was hard to resist, but this whole situation was something you had dreamed about, and something you didn't want to waste.
> You work into a rhythm, testing which parts of her reacted more notably to your probing.
> You had almost built a suitable mental map of her peaks and valleys when she called out.
> "A-are you d-done yet?"
> It takes a moment for you to work out why she would ask such a question so soon.
> The average stallion had a member large enough to put most other races to shame, but they were notoriously lacking in the endurance category.
> A popular nickname online for them was 'two pump chump'.
> If her only experience was anthro horse sex-ed, then she would've only been taught to expect as such.
> While she was unaware of your capabilities however, you had been reading up on that of a mare...
> "Done?" you respond silkily.
> "I'm only just getting started my dear..."
> You give her rump a rough squeeze and resume your movements, making sure to hit her soft spots with more force than before.
> As you start moving against a more deliberate set of targets, you try remember what you had read about mares...
> Despite the length of the average horse dick, a typical mare was more sensitive at the shallower parts of her anatomy.
> Your manhood wasn't a match in size to a horse, but it was certainly more than enough to send this girl over the edge, and that was exactly what you planned to do.
> As she bucked and moaned under your escalating assault however, you hit an unexpected snag.
> Her tail kept flipping about and slapping into your face.
> It wasn't something you could ignore for long, so you grabbed it and pulled it to the side, admittedly a bit rougher than intended.
> It had a surprising effect on her.
> As you pulled, her walls clamped down tighter on you, and she let out a yelp of shocked arousal.
> You slow your pace, and give her another squeeze to get her attention.
> "Did you like that?"
> "Yeah... I d-did..."
> You smile.
> "Do you want me to do it again?"
> She twitches, her tail attempting to flick within your grasp.
> "Y-yes..."
> "Then ask me."
> She doesn't take long to get your meaning.
> "Please... p-pull my... tail..."
> You happily oblige, giving the braided plume of horsehair an experimental tug.
> She once more clenched almost painfully around you and moaned.
> You pick up the pace again, hitting the spots inside you knew got the biggest reaction, and held her tail tight.
> But you didn't pull.
> As she gasped and groaned, she struggled to form the words.
> But they managed to slip from her lips.
> "Again... please..."
> You time your next tug with your next thrust, causing her to lose her footing completely and fall to her knees.
> You didn't stop though.
> She spoke again.
> "Harder... pull harder...
> You comply, eliciting a full throated moan this time.
> You keep at it, thrusting and pulling, the only legible words escaping her now being "Harder!".
> When she finally reached her limit you weren't quite as prepared for the results as you thought.
> Her cries reached a crescendo as her slit caught you in a death grip...
> And she squirted a veritable torrent of juices from her orgasming snatch, soaking your crotch thoroughly.
> You felt her relax as she slowly succumbed to the awaiting afterglow.
> A sharp slap to her flank brought her attention back though.
> "Ow! Why did you-"
> You lean as far forward as you can, and whisper something she hadn't been expecting.
> "I'm still not done yet, almost..."
> You felt her tense up again.
> "You're still not done!?!" she whimpered.
> It was time to let loose, with your personal goal achieved there was only the last part now...
> To fill her up with your seed and claim her as yours.
> Another slap to the flank elicits a yelp, as you then start going at her properly, and without restraint.
> She started to moan again as you pounded her still sensitive pussy with the power and intent of a man possessed.
> You deliberately position yourself to get as much of your length inside with each thrust, hitting as many of her weak points as possible as you plunge in and out.
> You can hear her gibber something but there's no stopping now.
> You feel it coming, bubbling up in expectation as you get closer and closer...
> Then, with a final pull of her tail as you thrust, you reach the end of the line.
> You feel her shudder and buck as your thick cum paints her inner sanctum white, the sensation of you gushing against her sensitive folds dragging another orgasm from her.
> Even as you are finally spent, you feel her snatch still rippling and sucking on your drained member hungrily, eagerly milking every last drop.
> With your work done, you pull out, and place a gentle kiss on her shaking flank.

> It doesn't take you long to extract her from the collapsed boxes and shelves.
> She's a mess, but her long face is flushed and content.
> As she tries to straighten out her dress, you hand her a slip of paper.
> "My number." you explain.
> "I like you, so if you want to spend more time together then give me a ring."
> You then pick up one of the boxes of booze not soiled by her juices and head back up to the party.
> You don't need to look back or take her number, you saw it in her eyes already.
> She was yours, she would call, and you'd be riding her again before the week was out.

> Once you had left, she took a few minutes to compose herself.
> She tidied her hair, adjusted her dress and carefully bagged your number.
> As she strode up the stairs and back out into the crowd, it was impossible to tell what had just happened.
> Apart from the thin line of human seed slowly running down her inner thigh and towards her ankle...
