Chapter 1 : Obey

>"Enemy to your 9, around that corner, eliminate"
>"Yes Sir"
>On the Monitor that you're watching, the combatant's body bursts apart
>Your Donner quickly advances though the building, clearing each room as you direct her
>"Small room to your right, check it"
>"Yes Sir"
>A quick peek around the corner and there are 4 combatants
>Her left arm points to each combatant with terrifying precision and accuracy
>"Hostages are on the top floor according to intel, proceed with caution" 
>An extra Mechanized voice through the comms to you alone through your headset
>It's up to you on what to do with the information
>Gotta find a way to the top floor...you recall seeing an elevator but that seems like a bad idea
>As you watch the multiple monitors, you see what you need
>Stairs
>"Stairwell, at your 5, 6 meters, go" you say calmly
>"Yes sir"
>Her breathing is calm and you can see her pulse going at a steady pace on the Vitals screen
>You could set a metronome to her heartbeat if you wanted
>But you didn't want to, you wanted to focus on this and get back to R&R
>You swap your vision to thermal Imaging mode, and scan Her surroundings as she walked up the stairs and into a hallway
>"Heat signature through the wall to your left holding a weapon, shoot through the wall at 1.5 meters height in 3...2...1...Fire"
>A single round goes through the wall and you watch the signature slump
>"Good girl" you say with a smirk
>For a brief moment you see her heartrate jump a bit, then drop back down
>"Thank you sir"
>A slight hike in her voice tells you that your words have their desired effect
>Quickly scanning for anymore hostiles in the other rooms, you find none so you focus in front of her
>You can see the hostages with your thermal vision
>"Straight ahead, 3 bad guys standing, 4 hostages kneeling"
>You swap back to normal vision and panic
>"STOP"
>She freezes like a statue, foot hovering a foot off the ground
>You hear a slight whimper in her voice as she speaks "Sir?"
>"Trip wire, directly to your right, shoulder level for you" 
>You saw it just in time when you swapped back to regular vision
>She steps back then carefully ducks underneath it
>Satisfied with there no longer being an exploding hazard, you direct her once more
>"Right then Calamity, Kill the combatants and lets get dinner"
>"Yes sir"
>You watch as she begins running down the hall, her heavy footsteps thudding against the floors
>With a massive kick, she burst the simple wooden door into splinters
>The Combatants don't even get a chance to react
>They are all put down quickly by Calamity's thunderous fire
>"Done" you say calmly
>You watch through the screens as the hologram around Calamity melt away with the words "Simulation over" on the walls
>Removing your headset and leaving your seat, you leave the simulation chamber and meet up with Calamity
>Her left arm is slowly re-configuring from a Light machine gun into her normal paw
>Calamity is a Donner; Your Donner and you are Alpha Non "A.Non", Her handler
>Donner are Synthetics; combat frames underneath what appears to be a normal anthro
>She has living Muscle and Tissue, but isn't technically alive
>A literal walking talking weapon, standing at 7 and a half feet tall
>Made to look like a Sturdy Fox Anthro but with Rust red fur around her Muzzle, thighs and upper arms
>Sleek Black fur, covers her Chest and stomach as well as her lower legs and forearms
>And at the places the black and red touch, yellow flicks wrapped around like golden bracelets
>Striking Orange eyes look down at you as she pushes her black and gold hair back
>Her black urban camo Shirt is tight on her toned yet supple chest and tummy, and her black shorts are tight to her thighs
>You are a clone, a Specifically Bred handler for a Donner, made through Star-51 
>You grew up in combat simulations, learning Donner maintenance and diagnostics, Dietary needs for the Living tissue, and how to keep them under control
>The Control part was your specialty
>A Human weapon, sharper eyes, better hearing and faster reflexes, but still no match against your furry companion
>When you graduated and were given a Donner, they gave you Calamity, or rather she picked you
>Donners usually have one Handler for their entire life and assuming the Handler was good, he would have one Donner his whole life
>Before she picked you, she was seen as a bad egg; rude to everyone and barely getting along with the Donners she was "raised" with
>Some still think she is, but you don't care what they think
>The year is..well you actually can't say the year, so lets just go with 2018
>You live in Groundbase Delta, which was somewhere below what used to be northern america
>You can already hear Calamity's growling before you even reach the briefing room
>As soon as she gets the door open, shes roaring 
>"What. The. FUCK! Who Placed a fucking TRIPMINE in a hallway during the Simulation!? you Know I cant see wires that Thin"
>Shes already rounded on a poor technician who was sitting at a nearby computer terminal
>He just happened to be the one closest to her
>Chances are he had nothing to do with it but its too late
>He tries to scurry back from her, but she's already chosen that he gets to be the outlet of her rage
>Not like you were going to step in
>Not yet anyway
>"I had them put it there to see if A.non was paying attention, he almost got you blown up" a gravelly elderly voice cuts through
>Omega, the Lead handler, sits in an evaluation chair with a checklist marking your performance
>He was the oldest handler, His Donner long since passed
>"SHUT IT! That wasn't anywhere else in our training! And he DIDN'T get me blown up, you Prune!" she barks at him "Why would you do it HERE during an evaluation?"
>Omega just smirks at her
>"Because I was certain A.non was capable enough to handle it and that you would respond as needed Calamity, you both passed with flying colors"
>While you like the vote of confidence, you wished he would have just stuck to the scripted scenario
>But hearing the news that you had passed offset Calamity's rage with a look of hope, although you were the only one to recognize it
>"Does this mean we're finally Master rank?"
>She was, of course, referring to your rank
>Currently you were a Chief Handler, and enjoyed the perks that came with it
>That meant you got to share a room with Calamity, although you also had to share it with another handler and another Donner
>But if you were a Master handler, then you got your own private room with her
>You look to Omega hopefully, and have those hopes shattered when he shakes his head
>"I'm afraid not, your work in the Simulator, while exemplary, was not enough to gain you rank A.non"
>Calamity growls once more and grabs a thick hardbound training manual before tearing it in half easily
>"Then WHAT was the fucking Point of the TRIPMINE" she roars as she throws the shreds to the floor
>You walk forwards and place a hand on her arm
>"Language Calamity" you say calmly "We'll get it next time"
>She looks down at you with a frown, looking into your eyes with her fiery orange eyes that betray a hint of sadness
>"Yes Sir"
>You nod and look to Omega, who has an annoying smirk
>"Congratulations on passing your eval, you are dismissed" He says waving you off 
>You nod and point to the door "Let's go Calamity"
>As you leave the room, you hear one of the technician behind you picking up the pieces of the shredded training manual
>"He really needs to get her under control" is the last thing you hear before you shut the door
>Calamity is waiting for you, fuming still
>She stomps ahead of you, growling angrily
>"Putting in NEW shit and then NOT promoting us! how fucking DARE they!" she growls as she walks along
>Another smaller Donner ,probably an infiltration model, and her handler walk past Calamity, who growls loudly "What are YOU looking at tiny?"
>The pair scurry past her, looking at you like you were a terrible parent who couldn't control his child
>You only give a smug grin at them in response
>Fuck them, they were still the lowest rank and couldn't understand yet
>"Your Arm seemed to swap slower than Normal, everything ok with it?" you say, catching up to her and grabbing her left paw
>You turn it over in your hands a few times, frowning
>She giggles a bit as you part her fur to scan the configuration lines, the points where the the paw folds away into a weapon
>"It has been a bit Sluggish Sir"
>You nod and think about the diagnostics you'll run on it in the room
>Having the swap be slow could mean the difference in life and death for Calamity, even a second off was a no go
>The thought of Calamity getting hurt for no reason other than you were too lazy to run a diagnostic and maybe fix a servo or replace a wire eats at your soul, well if you have a soul anyway
>Your towering companion walks, baring her teeth at any unfortunate souls who walk by
>Even as you force her arm open and peer inside, she grumbles about not getting promoted
>"Watch where we go, I think I might see the Issue" you say as you focus fully on her arm
>"Yes sir"
>You reach your hand fully inside her arm, pushing past the sinew and servos
>Guided by feel alone, you attempt to grab what you saw
>At last, you feel it and grab it carefully
>"Calamity, how many times have I told you to not be a messy eater" you say as you pull out part of a chicken bone
>Her ears fold back and you see her tail try to push between her thick thighs
>"127 Sir" she says, bowing her head in shame
>You frown
>If there's part of a chicken bone then there's more of it in there
>"Why didn't you tell me when this happened? It would have been easier to deal with then" you say peering once more into the inner mechanisms of her left arm
>"You were sleeping, and I didn't want to wake you up" she says sadly
>You shake you head in disbelief, causing her to avoid eye contact
>That's not a reason, and the last thing you need is for other parts of her to get slowed down by bits of food
>Well whatever, the past is the past, you were going to have to spend the night opening her up and checking everything
>"What would you like to eat tonight Sir?" she asks, snapping you upright from your work
>She had lead you out into the main atrium, a wide wide open area where food machines lined the walls 
>Bustling crowds poured through, various shops and stores hand almost everything
>This was a underground city, full of businesses, and people living peaceful lives
>A fake Sun and Clouds drift on a the ceiling, which was covered in a huge projection screen
>Living underground bothered some people you guess
>Well, it bothered the regular born people, not you
>You spent your whole life here
>Calamity sniffs the air pensively, and you see a quick wag of her tail
>You pull your hands out of her arm and look up at her
>"What do you smell?" you say looking around
>Something caught her attention food wise, and the various Electronic food vendors would probably have something she wanted
>She shakes her head
>"No nothing is-"
>"Tell me"
>She looks to you then to a nearby alcove on a wall, a gleam of hope in her eyes
>You follow her gaze then look back to her
>"Fish Tacos? Why would you try to hide that?" you say calmly
>"Because I thought you don't like fish tacos with pineapple that I like sir"
>You tut at her as you lead her to the Kiosk by her paw
>"We Don't have to get the exact same thing when we eat you Cyber Cheeto, from now on just be a good girl for me and tell me ok?"
>You feel her tail wag slightly
>"You are my good girl, right?"
>A gentle squeeze on your hand from her and a soft "yes sir" are all the answer you needed
>As you walk through the various carts, people try to get you to buy their wares
>Each one that approached you however, got a simple "FUCK OFF" growled their way
>Calamity didn't let anyone within 2 feet of you as you both walked
>Even when you go to the kiosk and press your hand on the biometric Scanner, Calamity growls at anyone that comes too close to you
>The words "Alpha Non, Chief Handler" appear on the screen, then a selection Menu appears
>Another perk of your rank was that you got better quality foods from the synthesizers
>"What would you like Calamity?" you call over your shoulder as she stood facing the crowd, growling constantly
>There are sometimes robberies here in this vast underground complex, you had heard of a few Handlers getting jumped for their higher quality meals
>But if they wanted to rob you, they would have to go through Calamity
>"7 fish tacos! And don't skimp on the pineapple Salsa"
>You punch in what she wants and shudder at the thought of pineapple in salsa
>Almost as bad as pineapple on pizza....
>You kiosk whirrs and dings when her food is done, it pops out in a handy to-go box
>You grab it and put it under your arm then punch in what you want
>4 Asada tacos, medium salsa
>Keeping it simple was the way to go
>You exit out of the kiosk and carry your meals to you willing escort
>"Lets head back to the room, are A.lfa and Vupel back from their Mission?" you ask as you take note of everyone
>The crowd parts around you as Calamity's growling gets louder
>She leads the way to the transport vessel; the complex was so large that there needed to be these that traveled all over it like a patchwork of spider webs
>They were basically rail lines, except more frequent and fully automated, you barely had a minute to wait until the next one
>And the fewer people there are on it, the faster you get to your stop
>You had to get to the Handler / Donner living barracks
>Separate from the civilians, they were kept on near the other side of the base
>"Not yet, we get the room to ourselves tonight" Calamity finally growls
>That made things easier later tonight
>You board the transport and Calamity follows, then growls at anyone who tries to follow on
>"OURS! FUCK OFF" she roars at the crowd
>She's scary enough to frighten everyone else that was already boarded off as well
>You smirk at the stunned faces as Calamity takes a seat
>The transport lifts up on its holopads and takes off as you set the food down and input your destination on a small info pad
>You turn to see Her Lazing across the seats, this thing was made to carry up to 30 people and she made it so you didn't have to worry about prying eyes
>Calmly you beckon her over to you with a finger
>Her ears perk up and she stands up and begins to walk to you when you give a sharp "No"
>You point down
>"Crawl to me Like a good girl would" 
>She gets on her hands and knees and crawls slowly to you as the base speeds by in a blur
>When she reaches you, you pull off her view collar with a gentle "good girl"
>The view collar is what allowed you to see near 360 what Calamity was doing in battle
>It also allowed you to communicate with her via interface
>But you didn't need that collar now, you had a different one
>You pull a black leather collar out of your pocket and snap it around her eager neck
>"T-Thank you sir"
>You pet her ears softly, earning you a furious tail wag
>"Stand"
>She gets to her feet and you look outside quickly, seeing where your stop was 
>Satisfied with your observation, you look back up at her
>Gently, you place your hand on the back of her head and pull her into a kiss, pressing your tongue into her mouth
>She reciprocates, using hers to fight yours for real estate 
>Hers wins out, being both bigger and stronger than yours
>When at last you hear the tell tale sound of the Transport slowing you push her away, leaving her panting and whimpering slightly
>"Get it together" you order as you pick up your food and hers
>"yes sir"
>A moment later a ding is heard and you're stepping out into the living areas for the handlers and Donners
>Rank meant a lot here
>As you walk through the are you see lots of handlers and Donners interacting in this common area
>But you also see the doors to the barracks
>The first rank of handlers were "Private Handlers" 
>The Donners and Handlers had separate Barracks, and within those they had coffin like bunks they slept in
>No space, no freedom
>Like a prison barge
>The next rank, "Senior Handlers" got a bit more
>Still strictly separate sleeping areas, but instead of stacks of coffin, they were large beds, set into the walls with large lockers
>And from there it only got better
>you had the goal of Master Handler so that you had the privacy of your own room
>you wave hello to a few of the Donners and Handlers you knew while Calamity simply scowled and growled at everyone
>"Hey A.non get that promotion? We heard your simulati-" one of the Senior handlers says coming forwards, only to get cut off 
>"FUCK OFF CUNT" Roars Calamity
>"Whoa there Calamity!? Something bothering- Wait.. You didn't get the promo did you?" he says looking from the scowling Calamity to your frowning face
>"No we didn't Sigma" you say as you walk along
>"What?! You were like top of our class! You got promoted so fast!" Sigma says in disbelief
>He was right, you and Sigma had been in the same graduating class, yet he was only a senior handler
>Calamity Growls louder
>"We don't wanna talk about it!" she snarls
>Sigma raises his hands and goes back to His Donner and the group he was talking to
>"Still as rude as ever I see Calamity, I don't know how A.non can deal with you"
>You ignore the remark and go to a large door, reminiscent of vault doors with the Letters C.H. on it
>"Hold these for me please" you say to Calamity, handing her the food
>She takes them silently as you press your hand on the scanner 
>It flashes Green and the vault doors to the Mixed living areas open
>You take the food from Calamity and walk into the area slowly
>This area is better decorated, and has more in the terms of R&R
>From what you had heard of the old world, this place was similar to a 4-star hotel of old
>Keep the high Ranking handlers happy and you'll get better results in battle
>Here a Few Handlers sit with their Donners, and even a few Donners sit with other handlers
>Televisions, a few game consoles and some other things to kill time
>a Few large Holoplayers to play holographic Movies
>There was a workout area further down and a full swimming pool, although Donners can't swim
>But you didn't have time for any of that, you had other things you wanted to do
>Walking calmly with food in hand, you go to your's and Calamity's room
> "305"
>The door swings open, grant admittance to the room beyond
>The room isn't small by any means, but having to share it was a huge constriction on space regardless
>Split down the middle by a curtain system you and A.lfa had put up for at least a little privacy
>The shared Bathroom and shower was on his side though
>You push past the curtain and look around at your stuff
>A large bed, large enough to accommodate you and Calamity comfortabley, a computer next to a docking bay on a nice table
>A few tool chests, a freestanding wardrobe, and a chest of spare parts
>Not much in this 10x15 foot space
>But you made it work
>"Sit down and open up for me babe" you say as you set the food down
>She sits at a larger chair and sets her arm on the table and opens it for you, folding away so you could access her systems 
>"Any other bits of food in there I need to know about?" you ask as you dig through your tool chest for a boroscope to peek inside
>"No sir" she says with a small smile
>You sit down next to her and get to work
>While you snake the long wire into her arm, she uses the other arm to start eating her Tacos
>On you computer screen you watch as the camera snakes its way in
>Nothing so far
>Then as you near her shoulder, you see bits of ground bone in one of the servos
>"Found it, open up your shoulder for me"
>She turns from you and a panel on her back opens revealing her shoulder servos and other parts
>You see her heart pulse as you clean out the servos of any bone and marrow
>Her heart was to keep the living muscle that covered her frame alive, as well it kept other more private parts alive
>You take a final look for any extra bone fragments, not wanting to have to dig deeper into her
>Satisfied that there are no more long lost bits of food in her, you reach into your tool chest and grab a can "MR. Worldwide's Donner oil"
>Specially made Oil just for Donners, helps to Lube up her Joints and it didn't smell all that bad either
>You smile as you apply it, then close up the panel and pat her back gently 
>"All done, Good Girl"
>Her ears perk up and her large chair swivels around so she can face you
>"Thank you Sir"  She says quietly, her fluffy tail wagging quickly
>You smile and rub her ears gently
>"You did a good job in the simulations today, I'm proud of you"
>She gives you a big toothy smile "Thank you! I couldn't have done it without you"
>you continue petting her ears before pulling her into another Deep kiss
>Once again you fight her tongue with yours, noting the faint taste of pineapple
>She pulls you out of your chair in a vicious hug, still kissing
>you pull your head back a bit, breaking the kiss and feeling her breasts pressing against you
>she begins sniffing you rapidly, savoring the scent of your hair 
>"Sirrr, Please tell me we have tomorrow off" Calamity whines, through her ferocious sniffs
>"I'm Afraid not, we have Patrol tomorrow" you say, turning around in your favorite Donner's lap
>She continues sniffing and rubbing against you while you eat and occasionally rub her thighs 
>When you finish eating, you stand and take off your Uniform top, looking directly into Calamity's eyes
>"I'm going to shower, you know what I Expect correct?" you say as you, slide your Urban camo pants off
>She gives a quick nod "Yes sir"
>You smile and rub your hand against the side of her head and muzzle
>"Good girl"
>As you turn from her you hear her tail furiously wagging
>You go into the shower and start it up, testing the water before you get into it
>Today wasn't a day that needed Calamity to have her fur washed and have you clean her gear and weaponry
>That was a day long process, where you had to strip her weapons, take them apart and clean them, as well as go through every servo and piston to clean and lube it
>Today was just a simulator in sterile conditions
>You wash quickly, not wanting to leave her out there waiting too long
>The burst of cool air you feel when you step out of the shower is refreshing as you grab your towel and dry off
>"I'm done Calamity, are you ready?" you call out as you hang it back up
>The door opens and Calamity stands before you, wearing only her collar and holding a leash
>"Everything is ready for tomorrow sir, and the holoplayer is ready for us" she says wagging her tail gently
>With A.lfa gone on a mission, you didn't need to hide Calamity's leash, nor get dressed
>You smirk calmly and take the leash, leading your shivering Donner to the bed
>Shes not cold, her fur wouldn't allow that, she just wants your touch
>"Good girl"
>You lay down and pat the spot on the bed next to you
>"Mmmmmm Yesss Sirrr" she purrs as she crawls into the bed and into your waiting arms
>She cuddles up to you and you click a button on your holoplayer remote
>The movie "Tremors 2 in 4D" starts playing as you hold Calamity close
>Gently you rub her ears and stomach fur as the movie plays, carefully avoiding her erogenous zones
>She was the best thing that could ever happen to you
>Sure some people thought you don't control her well enough
>But you knew it was just enough to keep this fun

Chapter 2: Sit Next To Me

>You awake to fur pressing against the side of your face and a small digitized beeping sound
>Calmly, you reach over and turn off your alarm clock, then yawn
>"Calamity, time to get up" you say as you gently rub her chest and stomach
>You watch as her eyes open slowly, the usual orange replaced by a dull grey
>Slowly she sits up, her movements rigid and deliberate
>She stays sat upright for a moment, stiff as if she suffered rigormortis
>But after a moment the Orange light returns to her eyes and you see her muscles and body relax
>She just had to go through her reboot cycle, those movements were her body moving before her systems fully booted up
>"Morning sleepyhead" you say as get out of the bed 
>You had to get out at the foot of the bed because you got the side closest to the wall
>Stretching as you walk to your wardrobe, you pull it open and peer inside
>Sure enough Calamity got everything ready for today
>A stirring noise behind you and large furry arms wrap around you from behind
>"Morning Sir" she says in a silken voice, nuzzling against your neck and the side of your face
>You reach up with one hand and pet the side of her face
>"How did my good girl Sleep" you say rubbing softly and savoring the soft fur beneath your fingers
>"I dreamt I was able to swim with you, and we were able to swim deep in the ocean without air" she whispers to you
>You nod and rub her muzzle softly
>"Come on Babe, let’s get dressed and get through the day, and if you're a really good girl, you might get a treat"
>This statement causes her ears to perk up 
>"I Reallllly want a treat sir" she whimpers to you as you pull on your uniform
>You turn around and Kiss her softly
>"Then be a good girl for me today" you say as you pull off her black leather collar and replace it with the view collar
>You look deep into her eyes and whisper "You are my good girl right Calamity?"
>She hugs you tight "Yes Sir" 
>"Alright then, get dressed and let’s get going" you say with a final kiss to her forehead
>You move out of the way to let her into the wardrobe so she can grab her uniform
>When she bends over to get her uniform, you grab her tail and give her ass a hearty Spank
>"OH! Yessss" she moans out as you pull it softly
>You let go and give another softer spank
>"A preview of things to come later"
>She gets dressed quickly, and taps her foot claws on the floor impatiently as you tie up your boots
>She doesn't need shoes at all, the bottoms of her footpaws were tough enough to walk on metal shrapnel without getting damaged
>Standing, you walk to the door and push it open
>The Living area is full of life as you and Calamity step out and shut the door
>Morning rush
>Donners of different shapes and sizes pour out with their handlers
>Different Models with different jobs
>Calamity leads the way, growling at almost everyone who gets too close
>Even the larger Donners steer clear, knowing her reputation
>While Calamity has never attacked any other Donners, She has had to defend herself and you from a few
>Ones that go rogue, ones that had their handler go rogue
>Some Donners have said they don't know if they could kill one of their kind
>Calamity had no issue following that order, and you had no issue giving it
>And aside from that she didn't get along with most
>You board the Transport to the main atrium, surrounded by Handlers and Donners, all headed to the same place
>Some have simulations today, you can tell just by looking
>Even here you can pick out the low ranking handlers not from their age or insignia, but from how their Donner's acted towards them
>Aloof, distant not sure if they can trust each other
>A few probably have gotten their Donner "killed" more than once in the simulation
>That happened to you once
>Once
>You had nightmares for weeks about it, guilt burdened you
>It wasn't until you had a training exercise, where you both had to spend a night together in a simulated survival scenario that it they stopped
>She woke you from your sleep, saying you were mumbling her name
>That's when you confided in her the nightmares
>That was the first time she hugged you and began trusting you
>The base zooms by as you stand on the transport, the seats are all taken on it by the older Handlers and their Donners
>Of course you don’t mind because Calamity stands with you, growling at anyone coming too close
>When the transport hovers to a stop at your destination, you're one of the first off because you were standing
>That also means you can get to one of the food Kiosks without much of a wait
>"What do you want Calamity" you call out over your shoulder as you tap away on the screen, getting your breakfast and Lunch
>"Gimme a steak omelet" you hear her say somewhat muffled "Extra Steak, that high quality stuff Sir"
>You peek over your shoulder and see her staring down a Lioness Donner and her handler
>Heh, He was still a private handler, and therefore wouldn't be able to get stuff like this
>At best he could maybe get her some plain eggs if he had even earned those
>Otherwise they would get stuck with the basics; Bread, milk, peanut butter for protein
>You punch in her request and then the machine makes a loud ding you grab the to go box
>All ready to get going for the day
>But you knew what Calamity wanted to do first
>"Here Calamity, Check to make sure it’s to your liking" you say handing her the box with a smile
>She pulls it open and lets the smell wafts out a bit before taking a long sniff
>You can see the other Donners nostril flare a bit as she sniffs as well
>"Perfect Sir" she says, still making eye contact with the lower ranked Donner, who eventually looks away
>What a smug cyber cheeto she is
>"Let’s go then, we got patrol" you say ushering her forwards
>As you turn you feel a hand on your shoulder that pulls you back around
>the lower ranked handler looks at you, Livid
>"That was fucked up! Your Donner was purposely teasing Lana wit-"
>You cut him off by grabbing his hand and twisting his wrist back towards his body
>"Don't fucking touch me, I don’t care that we hurt your feelings, if you want better food, get a better rank" you say as you twist him downwards on the floor
>You then look to his Donner who stands, flabbergasted and confused
>"And You! Your handler has just been attacked and you’re just standing there! PROTECT HIM" You roar at her angrily
>She jumps slightly then moves forwards only to Have Calamity instantly in her way
>"If you want a better Rank, get your shit together" you say to both of them as you release the fledgling handler
>You turn from then and leave with a simple "let’s go" to Calamity who answers "Yes sir"
>The pair are left dumbfounded as you walk away, the crowd parting around you like the red Seas
>Calamity always did that kind of stuff, and you loved it
>It was both funny and a way for you to help motivate new Handlers
>They see you, what you can do, and what you get for being good at what you do
>And they envy it so much
>So they try harder
>Through the tunnels you go, until you find your way to the mission planning room
>A big room filled with rows of tables
>Other Handlers are already there, a few you know, a few you don't and their Donners sit with them
>You find a corner table and sit down with Calamity pulling a chair up next to you
>Under the table you feel her paw on your leg, and you set your hand on top of it
>"Good girl Calamity" you say under your breath as you wait for Omega to arrive and start telling your groups where you're going
>The smell of yours and Calamity's omelets make your stomach growl, but now is not the time to eat
>The ride to where ever you're going is
>Thankfully you aren't left waiting for long
>Omega walks slowly to the podium at the front of the room
>"Good morning, I know you are eager to get to work, so I'll right to it" he says calmly as he sorts through a few pieces of paper
>"First of Red Squad, you’re going to The ruins of Austin, for routine patrol. Blue squad the surface city "Black Coast" asked for an escort for a few of their fuel shipments"
>He shuffled though his papers looking at them carefully, only your squad was left
>"Green squad, you have a new member, Echo and His Donner Calypso"
>You sigh, slightly annoyed
>The last thing you need to deal with is a FNG
>"And A.non, since you did so well on your simulation Eval yesterday, you get to guide him through his first surface Mission the Factory city El Dorado" Omega says with an annoying smile
>FUCK!
>Was he punishing you?
>You Hear Calamity groan next to you
>"Do I have to pretend to be her Friend Sir?" Calamity says with a frown
>"No" you say with a matching frown
>You can't even pick out him out in the sea of Donners and handlers
>Omega gives one last smile your way "Do take care of him A.non. Now then everyone is dismissed, report to your airships"
>You swear to yourself angrily
>This doing well on your Eval thing was just getting worse and worse
>The group begins filing out the doors, as you sit and contemplate your misfortune
>You HATE escort missions
>"Let’s go get to our airship" you say as you stand, approving of the amount of people who had filtered out
>Why try to push out and get to the airship first? It was still going to take off at the same time and you all had your spots reserved
>So waiting a little bit was fine with you
>You go out the doors and lead Calamity through the halls to the Hanger where massive command airships wait
>These are for monitoring Donners during missions and patrols, giant flying command posts that circled the deployed area
>There were Handler stations, chairs set up with 8 monitors and various inputs
>And next to those were seats, docking stations for the Donners to refill their energy weapons and power cells
>You enter your designated airship and go to your seat with Calamity in tow
>"Sit" you direct before fishing at your station for a pair of forks
>"Yes sir" she says as she obediently sits and begins to strap herself in
>A few stragglers hurry past, getting to their spots as you click on your Station
>The 8 Monitors flicker to life and you begin your standard check of each one
>"A.non?" comes a voice from your right
>A voice you don't recognize and already don't like
>You hear Calamity growling as you look for the offending distraction
>"What?"
>A man stands before you
>No, not yet a man. He doesn't quite carry himself like a man would, like someone who had seen horror and been through the worst mankind has to offer
>He stands tall and confident, His brown hair almost covering his eyes
>But you knew that confidence, the feeling that he knows it all because he got promoted and got out of the simulators
>Tombstone courage
>He thought he knew what was coming over the next hill because he saw what came over the last one
>That would get stripped away soon, when he saw what the world outside of the groundbase was like
>"Uh... I'm Echo, and this is Calypso. Omega said you were going to-" 
>"Shut up, Get to your Station and buckle in" you cut him off
>"But-"
>"FUCKING GO" Calamity roars at him, causing him to jump and scurry to his Station, which was unfortunately for you, next to yours
>You take note of his Donner, a 6 foot something badger of some sort, with gold spots around her eyes and a trail of golden fur going down her back to the tip of her tail
>She hurriedly gets into her docking station while Echo clicks on his station
>You put on your headset calmly and mouth "good girl" to Calamity, whose tail wags gently
>The engines begin to kick on as you check to make sure each monitor is connected to the view collar and Calamity ties her hair up
>"0 through 2 Check, 3 and 4 check, 5 and 6 check, 7 and 8 check, 9 and 10 check, 11 and 12 check, Vitals Check, Map check"
>As you list off each position, Calamity moves a paw in each cameras field of view
>Perfect, no lag and no delay
>"Test" you say through your headset mic to Calamity, "Here sir" she says back through the comms
>You nod calmly and hand Calamity her fork 
>She smiles at you as the airship lifts off and begins its slow ascent
>"A.non, my Station isn’t working! What do I do?!" you hear Echo call to you
>You frown and look over to him 
>His monitors have the message "No input" displayed, while he sits with a stupid confused look on his face
>"You need to sync your viewer with the station, just fucking plug it in" you say with mild annoyance
>Can't you just eat in peace?
>"Why didn't I-"
>You slam your fork down on your table
>"Because in the sims it syncs automatically. Now, let me FUCKING eat"
>Calamity waited for you this time, so you both eat together in silence while you hear Echo doing his checks
>As you eat, you take a quick look over to make sure he is doing everything right
>"Drone check! Can you hear me?" he calls releasing a small drone which begins circling Calypso
>"Of course I hear you Echo, you're right next to me" she says in an exasperated tone
>You silently chew your food and watch their interaction, noting her annoyance with him
>"Can we just skip this? We do it every time Echo" Calypso says, batting at the drone annoyed
>You frown at that but keep watch, making sure they actually do what’s required
>So he opted for a drone instead of a collar? 
>There were several options available to handlers for monitoring Donners
>But each had its bonuses and drawbacks
>While the drone was useful for getting an overhead view and allowed the handler mobile control of what he looked at, it was a clear target and on long running missions would run out of power
>The collar allowed 360 view but was restricted to the Donner themselves
>There were even glasses that allowed a handler to see what the Donner saw
>Turning back to Calamity, you finish your food in silence
>The Airship quietly rumbles as you think about the upcoming patrol
>These were generally quiet days, not much happened when a large group of Donners were in an area
>But still there was always the underlying danger
>You put a hand under your station's table and place it on Calamity's knee
>She gives you a smile as you gaze at her
>If anything happened to her....You don't know what you would do
>"Stay Safe out there" you say quietly, looking into those beautiful eyes
>She places her paw on your hand
>"I will cuz you're here with me Sir" she says with a smile
>You smile at her and squeeze her paw
>You know she can take a beating and walk away, but you would rather not have to deal with that
>Asking for her to always be out of safety just wasn't an option for her 
>She was a weapon, needed to protect the earth that you so desperately needed to rebuild
>This Factory city, El Dorado, was what is sounded like
>A city built around a single staple, usually 80% of the people who lived there took part in the industry
>If you recall correctly, El Dorado specialized in Steel
>They were a target for the groups that resisted Star-51, so most had near constant patrols going in shifts
>You place a hand on the side of her muzzle and rub it gently
>"I just want my good girl to be safe, ok?" 
>She leans into your hand and places her paws around it
>"As long as I have you sir, we are invincible"
>You hoped that was true
>"Calamity, I Lo-"
>"HEY A.NON! What are you guys doing?" Echo cuts through, walking over to you and leaning on the back of your chair
>"WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU THINK?" Calamity roars at him, causing him to back up away from you
>You see a few other handlers and their Donners look your way, only to shake their heads and go back to what they were doing
>"Sit back down at your Station, Get ready, don’t bother me with anything unless it’s an emergency"
>He looks at you a bit confused
>"But Omega said you were going to guide me!" he says, looking from you to Calamity, who is still growling at him
>You frown
>"Guide, not hold your hand, you've been through the simulators and can't be a total idiot since you're now a senior handler, ACT LIKE IT" You say, pointing him to His seat
>Calypso sits at her docking Station, frowning at you
>"Would it kill you to be nice? Do you dislike everyone THAT much?" She says as Echo gets back into his seat, his drone buzzing in circles
>"I don't dislike you, I honestly don't even care about you, I have a job to do and so do you, Focus on the fact that you could be killed and get serious about it" you answer, turning back to Calamity
>You breathe in deep and exhale loudly through your mouth, giving her an exasperated look
>She gives a small smile
>"Love you too Sir"
>You smile as you feel the airship begin dropping in altitude, but not because it was dropping in altitude
>Simply because she knew how you felt
>As the ship lowers you see plenty of handlers hugging or kissing their Donners
>Some Donners go other to other handlers for their kisses
>Not every Donner handler relationship was romantic, some viewed it as a business partnership, some Donners were great friends with their handlers but romantically involved with other handlers
>But most have that Romance
>"Eta 1 minute, Donners get ready" comes the pilot's voice through the loudspeaker as you unbuckle your seatbelt and stand up
>Calamity stays seated as you lean forwards, placing your hands on the wall behind her
>Her beautiful fluffy head between your arms, you lean forwards and give her a kiss
>You reach one hand forward and tug her collar a bit, causing a whimpering moan
>"Let’s go, good girl"
>She stands and you begin walking towards the back of the airship
>A large Bay door opens as the airship hovers about 30 feet from the ground
>The Donners begin jumping down wave by wave
>You give Calamity one final hug and head back to your station
>"Dropping in 3...2...1" 
>She drops out of the Airship and lands on her feet, swapping her arm quickly into its LMG form
>Other Heavy duty Donners land around her and the smaller models lower themselves on ropes
>"Any reports of activity in the area from previous patrol?" Calamity asks as she sets off through the city
>On the monitor that usually shows the map, you pull up any action reports
>"Looks like some probes of the defenses, as well a few scouts" you say as you read through the pages
>"Hey A.non, How do I get to the Action reports?"
>You sigh
>That was one that you would actually have to show him
>"On the lower right monitor, there is a button, press it and it’ll bring up and action reports" you say without looking at him
>You look at the city as Calamity walks slowly though the busy streets
>The surface cities are much dirtier than the groundbase
>People here seem happy though, if a little thin
>But they are little more than human cattle, born, living and dying in the same factory their whole lives
>Not that they had much of a choice, outside the cities was death and despair
>Dirt roads run though the city, which has power, decently clean water from the looks of it, and working machinery
>But it’s still a place made up of rickety shacks, cobbled together with Rivets and welding
>Little to no insulation, power lines with no surge suppression
>But it was in a decent place after what happened in the Last Great War
>Children run by Calamity, giggling and playing as she wanders through the city
>People generally ignore her actually, they are used to seeing Donners
>"Hey A.non, Why do you still have to do Patrols? Shouldn't you be doing Missions" you hear Echo call to you from whatever he was doing
>"Because there aren't enough Donners and handlers for only the lowest ranks to do them, granted you low ranked guys have to do more, but we still need to protect the people" you say calmly as you observe Calamity's surroundings
>Anyone could be an enemy, even a child; you had heard of resistance groups strapping bombs to children, knowing the Donners or their handlers would hesitate
>As Calamity walks through the city and people walk by, you keep an eye on everyone
>When people carry hidden weapons, they walk differently
>They hold it to stop it from swaying, or they heavy to one side, things like that
>You observe each person that walks by
>Trying to see which turn around, who tries to size up Calamity
>Lucky she stands taller than everyone around so you have a good view
>You can hear the other Handlers talking to their Donners and some through their Donners to the locals
>Trying to get extra parts, maybe bits of metal for projects back in the base
>You can even see a few people from the base contracting division trying to get an extra supply of steel
>"Stick to the Outskirts of town Calamity, the reports said that there were possible probes of the security" you say as you watch her move through the crowds
>"Yes sir" 
>Calamity slowly makes her way to the outskirts of town, monolithic rocks jut out from the dirt, covered in lichens and moss
>You don’t remember what this place was called before the Last Great war, but you hoped the scenery was at least a bit better then
>Smoke pours into the sky from the nearby steel mill and you can see Slag being dumped into large basins, probably to go through refinement again
>"Ugh I hate it here Sir" Calamity says waving a paw in front of her nose
>You look around at the various monitors, look for a reason
>"Why? What’s up Calamity?" you ask calmly
>She plugs her nose
>"It smells SO bad here Sir! I don’t want my Fur getting all Stinky! Good girls aren’t stinky!"
>Right you can't smell it here in the command airship
>"Then go somewhere nicer love, I think on the other side of town there is a flower grove" you say as you check your map of the area
>Near the edge of the refinery, where trucks load up with their beams of steel, is what looks like an a grove of flowers or an orchard
>The thought of hugging Calamity when she smelled of honeysuckles floats in your head for a moment
>"Go there, you can also watch over the shipping yards while you’re there, north east" you direct her, zooming in on your map quickly
>You look over to Echo to make sure he wasn't being an idiot
>To your dismay, but not surprise, he is simply flying his drone around his Donner, who is looking more and more annoyed
>"Calamity I have to deal with something really quick" you sigh through your mic
>"Let me guess, the FNG?" she hisses 
>"Yea one sec"
>you remove your headset and stand, cracking your back gently before walkking over to Echo with a frown
>He's giggling like an idiot while doing small buzzing flyovers above calypso, who is getting madder by the second
>you lean down next to him, knowing he's too engrossed in annoying his Donner to notice you
>"What are you doing Echo" you say sternly, looking right at the screen ahead of him
>He jumps almost a foot into the air from his seat
>"I - uh I was just Playing with Calypso" he says as he flies the drone behind her again
>You pull his headset off and speak into the Mic as you move the drone to see her face
>"Calypso, this is Alpha; Was Echo Playing with you or annoying you?" you asking it, watching her reaction in the drone feed
>Her ears fold back as she answers "H-he was annoying me sir"
>You shove the headset into Echo’s Chest forcefully
>"QUIT FUCKING AROUND, you might have just gotten promoted but you can JUST as easily get demoted again" you roar at him angrily
>he looks at you with disbelief on his face
>"Seriously? It’s Just patrol! Not like anyth-" He stops when he sees your scowl
>You push him out of his chair and type away, pulling up archives of fallen Donners
>"This was LAST WEEK, a Patrol group of Donners was ambushed in a different factory city, no survivors" you pull up pictures of the Donners, mangled and broken
>"THIS was 3 days ago" you pull up a video feed from a view Collar where it show a Donner walking along until an explosion stops the feed
>"She lost an arm and a leg, as well part of her processor got damaged" you say looking at the stunned Handler
>"They were just on Patrol right? Get serious or you're going to be the reason Calypso dies" you say with a frown
>He looks like he's about to retort but decides against it, hanging his head low
>"Yes sir Alpha" he finally says
>You nod and leave his station and go back to yours
>"Sorry Calamity, anything happen while I was gone"
>You scan the monitors quickly, looking for anything out of the ordinary
>"No sir, I reached the orchard though" she says pointing with her paw
>so it was an orchard, at least you can identify that from a satellite map
>Orange trees? That’s what it looks like to you
>White petals billow past in the breeze, making you painfully aware how still the air was around you
>For all the missions you've been on, you've never actually been on the surface
>You never had a reason to, other than Calamity
>Calamity catches a petal carefully in her paw
>"These smell good sir, I hope you like it" She says as she holds it to her collar
>"Wish I was there with you Calamity, what does wind feel like?" you ask, lamenting that you aren’t physically there
>"Like air from a fan but gentler; And you are here sir" she says calmly
>You sigh and continue monitoring the feeds, watching the petals billow by and the shipment trucks come and go
>Hours go past as you sit and watch
>It's almost like you’re there with her
>Almost
>As you watch a truck pull out of the shipping dock, you notice something
>A momentary glint of light in one of your monitors
>"Stop" you say, calm yet fearing the worst
>Calamity freezes and waits
>Another small glint, a flash of light on top of a tall hill to her 7 O'clock as she looked out at the barren dusty scenery
>"Handlers and Donners, any people in sector A7?" you call out over the "Guard" radio frequency
>This frequency was for getting in contact with all Handlers and Donners in the immediate area to prevent friendly fire
>You wait and hear a choir of "Negative" before you zoom in with your camera
>Technology has come a LONG way to let you zoom this far and still have a clear picture
>As you look at the monitor you see 2 things, the glint of light off binoculars and what looks like a rifle
>This sets you on edge but you don't want to jump the gun on this
>Quickly, you pull up the radio freq for the "Big House"
>The group or family or whatever it is they call themselves that owns the mill has a sort of house for people
>A special place for the most loyal workers, better food, cleaner water
>And while they were the biggest local threat to Star-51, they were also loyal to it
>"Bighouse, this is mobile command ship 17, do you have any records of civilians in sector A7?"
>A scratchy garbled response, but clear enough to make out
>"Negative"
>You swap back to normal radio as you think of what to do
>Better safe than sorry 
>"Command, I have a possible resistance scout, permission to engage?"
>"Approved"
>You smile, and to think you thought today would just be a simple patrol
>"Calamity, swap to the linear fusion Rifle, target is to your 7, fire at will"
>You watch as her left arm folds back into a paw and then her right paw fold into a long sleek rifle
>Linear fusion rifles are high powered energy weapons, they took a bit to charge up the single shot, but it was concentrated enough punch through 4 inches of steel
>"Yes sir, I see him now"
>You watch her rifle charge then unleash its shot with a loud "PSSHOW"
>Instantly the glint gets hit by the energy bolt and disappears in a haze of Static energy
>You smirk and give a simple "Good Girl"
>Calamity's heart rate jumps a bit
>"Does this good girl get a treat Sir?"
>"Yes"
>Her heart rate spikes even higher as you try to find someone to confirm the kill
>"Can I get a Check of area A7, possible hostiles eliminated" you call over the radios
>"Oh! OH Calypso is in A6, we'll go!" you hear echo call to you from his station, 
>"Say it over the radio, like in the simulations" you answer him with a frown
>"Oh right! uh Calypso is headed to A7" he says over the radio
>"Whitney is headed there as well" you hear an extra voice
>D.Fox and his Donner must have been nearby
>You monitor the area as the Donners go to the area on a hill overlooking the mill
>Whitney gets there first and Calypso a moment later
>"Kill confirmed, looks like a Sniper" Echo says over the radio
>"But there is only one body, well what’s left of one, I smell 2 people though" Whitney’s voice comes through
>You frown at that news
>A sniper and a spotter, probably advanced scouts
>"I think they were from Shadow" D.Fox says
>That makes you frown more
>Shadow is the biggest resistance group, and while you think the name is dumb, they aren’t
>The Shadows attempt to force their will upon the world, and to push everything forwards with no regard for what could happen
>They just want to be on top
>Rogue Handlers and Donners often join them
>But taking down a scout is good for you
>You put a new hash mark on a piece of paper taped to your station
>"That’s 207 confirmed kills Calamity, good job"
>You see her tail wag in the camera feed
>Whitney, a large Small Border Collie Donner stops stiffing the area where the now dead sniper lays
>"They had something" she says, picking up a remote
>"What is it?" Calypso asks
>From Calamity's viewpoint so far away you can’t see, so you move over to Echo's station to look
>"That would be a Detonator, probably for C4" you say as you look at it
>Calypso nearly drops it when you say that
>"Whitney do you smell any explosives here?" you hear D.Fox over the radio
>"Negative, they must've planted it already"
>You frown and head back to your station
>Calamity, while she was an amazing Donner, was not made for explosive retrieval 
>"Command we need EOD Donners here, looks like they might have planted explosives in the mill" you say as you pull on your headset
>"Copy A.non, EOD in route"
>You look over at Echo 
>"It's just patrol right?" you say with a smile
>He frowns and looks back at his monitors
>"I...I'll take it more seriously next time" he says staring at Calypso
>You nod calmly
>"Good" is your only response
>Luckily the rest of the Patrol is uneventful
>When the airship lands near the drop off point, you’re already standing and ready to greet Calamity
>As D.Fox stands next to you waiting for Whitney, you give him a small fist bump "Thanks for confirming that kill D."
>He nods, "good job spotting that scout"
>That’s all that needs to be said, as you walk towards Calamity, who is entering the airship up the ramp
>You greet her with a big hug, where she pulls your face deep into her fur, making you smell the orange blossoms
>"Smells good baby" you say rubbing you hand down the side of her face
>She gives you a quick kiss and then you lead her back to your station and her Docking Station 
>"How was the power output for the Fusion rifle?" you ask as she sits down
>Her arm swaps to the rifle and you plug a wire into a port on it, and download the data
>"Hmm good, it’s still normal, I was concerned because we haven’t used it for a while"
>"Do I still get my Treat Sir?" she says looking hopeful
>You nod "Why wouldn't you? I said you deserved it"
>Her tail wags behind her through a hole in her chair
>"I like hearing it from you directly Sir" she whispers as she leans in close to you
>You pull off her view collar and then grab her regular black leather collar and put it around her neck
>"My Good girl was the Best girl today, so she gets a Treat" you say with a calm smile
>You see her tail going crazy behind her and her heart rate jumps
>A bit annoying for everyone to see that, so you shut down your station, then place a hand on the side of calamity's muzzle
>"goooood girrrlll" you coo to her as you rub her fur softly
>she whines softly, holding your hand before putting your thumb into her mouth and suckling it gently
>"Sir, I want you now" she whines after catching her breath
>You smile at her
>"Soon baby"
>The airship flies quickly, as Calamity squirms and whines softly
>Luckily the flight back seems quicker than the flight there
>As soon as the airship lands and opens it bay door, Calamity is up and unbuckling you
>"Hey A.non some of us are going for beers, wanna come along?" D.Fox asks as you stroll out of the airship 
>"FUCK OFF" roars Calamity at him, although he's used to her shouts to be phased by it
>"I'll pass this time thanks though" you respond
>You walk through the base to the main atrium, where because of the late hours, it’s almost empty
>12 hour patrol shifts do that, plus travel time
>The Majority of the other handlers and Donners go out, getting beers or food
>But you had something better to do
>Even as you sit on the transport alone, Calamity has her face buried in your lap sniffing hard
>"Stand" you say as your stop approaches
>A quick peek into the barracks reveal no one is around
>You had just the thing for this
>Calamity is so eager to get going she bounds off the transport as you step out slowly
>"Calamity" you call out as she rushes to the Chief Handler dorms
>She turns around, looking a bit disappointed you haven’t rushed after her
>"Yes sir?"
>You pull a leash out of your pocket and slowly unwind the Brown beaten leather
>"Come"
>Her eyes light up and she slowly walks to you "yes sir"
>She stops in front of you and you hook the leash to her collar
>"Good girl"
>You slowly walk, leading her through the Barracks
>A peek behind you and you can see the growing wet spot on her groin
>She goes to try and press a paw to it for some relief but you tug the leash sharply
>"No touching"
>"Y-yes sir" She moans out
>You make it to the Chief handler door and press you hand to the scanner
>The door slides open but you don’t move as Calamity presses against you
>"S-sir? Please I ne-""
>"Take off your Shirt" you say holding out your hand and letting go of the leash momentarily
>Without question she pulls it off and hands it and the leash to you
>Bright pink nipples push out through her black fur 
>Her tits were in a word, amazing
>Big enough to squeeze, suck, and tease
>But you wanted something else too
>"Now your shorts"
>She slides them off and you can see the droplets of liquid from her soaked Pussy
>"Good girl"
>You tug the leash once and start for your room through the Living area
>She walks slowly at first, slightly slouched over, but when you tug the leash again she stands up tall and struts
>That's your girl
>Reaching the door to your room, you press a hand to the scanner and it slides open
>You pull Calamity in, press a button to close the door then look straight into her eyes
>"Now then good girl....It's time for your treat"

Chapter 3: Come on and Feel it
>With the door shut and the outside world tuned out, you can finally focus on Calamity
>She stands before you, whimpering softly while her juices drip down her legs
>Slowly you pull her to you, looking up into her eyes
>Those eyes tell you everything you know she wants
>Tugging the leash softly, you guide her into a kiss
>Instantly her tongue is in your mouth, feeling every inch of it while yours does the same to her, feeling her sharp fangs
>"Sirrrrrr Please I need you” she moans quietly into your mouth as she pulls away
>You smile and guide her with the leash to one of your tool chests
>Who said they had to be tools for fixing Calamity?
>You slide the lock and open the box, which contains various "tools"
>Vibrators, rope, handcuffs, gags, and various other tools for you to "Fix Calamity"
>"Hmm let’s see what kind of Treat my good girl gets today" you say as you casually look at various odds and ends
>You hold up a gag and look at it, then look to Calamity
>"Hmmm not yet" you say as you set it aside
>At last you find what you were searching for
>A vibrating dildo with a remote, too small to fully satisfy her, but more than enough to get her going
>"I think this is a good Start for my good girl" you say beckoning her over "Come"
>She obediently gets on her paws and knees and crawls to you
>"Good Girl, now turn around for me" you say petting the side of her muzzle
>Quickly she turns around, presenting her plump ass and hindquarters to you
>Liquid drips down and you gently press a finger between her soaked lips
>"What does my good girl want?"
>She shivers and moans as you rubs your finger slowly up and down her slit, gently pressing her clit as you finger slides by
>"I-I want you Sir" she stammers out between moans
>"Oh I know you do, but you have to earn that treat first" you say calmly
>You pull your finger away from her, causing her to moan softly
>"Sir I want you nnO- AHHH!" you cut her words short, pushing the vibrator deep inside her gushing wetness
>"You have to earn it, or are you being a bad girl and telling me what to do?"
>She whimpers softly as you turn the vibrator on with the click of a button on the remote
>"N-no Sir, I'm a good g-girl!"
>You smile and turn back to your tool chest
>Cuffs? Why not?
>"Stand, and don't let that Vibe fall out"
>She stands quickly, keeping her thick thighs together, careful to keep it in
>"Turn"
>As she turns away from you, you see wetness drip down her thighs, which are trembling
>Slowly you bring her wrists behind her back and click the handcuffs on, then give her ass a hard slap
>She could easily break those handcuffs if she wanted, but she won't
>"Now then Good girl... are you ready to earn it?"
>She nods slowly while turning back to you
>"Yes sir"
>"Kneel"
>She kneels in front of you, sniffing quietly at your uniform pants
>You quietly pull off your belt, and kick your pants off to a corner of the room
>Calamity pressed her nose and muzzle into your boxers, sniffing deeply
>"Sir your smell is soooo good"
>You smile 
>"Take them off"
>Calamity nods quickly and grips you boxers waistband with her teeth, then pulls them off you, allowing your erection to spring free
>Calm and collected as you usually are, her smell, her moaning, her submissiveness and her body was too much to NOT be aroused
>"Can I clean it for you Sir?" Calamity say as she slowly sniffs your length
>"A good girl would"
>Slowly and gently, she runs her long wet tongue up and down your shaft
>"Mmmm tastes good sir" she moans before taking her length into her mouth
>You weren't small by any means, and although she might be 7'6 you can feel the back of her throat constricting around your cock's head
>She's holds it deep in her mouth, wrapping her tongue around it and pumping up and down
>She slowly pulls her head back, letting your cock slide between her large canine teeth, all the while carefully caressing you with her tongue
>Her eyes locked onto yours as she pushes all the way back down to your base, and gently licks at your balls 
>Back up and back down, her pumps her head and body, causing her breasts to jiggle and bounce
>"Just like that good girl"
>She continues her rhythmic pumping, moving her head like a piston
>With every movement she uses her long tongue to lap at you and massage your shaft
>You click the remote for the vibrator, kicking it up again
>Calamity moans around your shaft, her eyes partially close and she moans and leans forwards
>"No Cumming Calamity, only good girls cum when I give them permission”
>She slides back, popping your cock out of her hungry mouth
>"Yessss sirrrr" she moans looking into your eyes
>"Get back to it"
>Instantly she latches back onto your cock, licking and slurping wildly 
>"Mmmm Sirrr you taste so good!" she moans happily, licking up and down your hard shaft
>You place a hand on her head and force her back down
>"Good girls don't talk with their mouths full"
>Long slurping licks are your answer
>You watch as she sloppily licks and sucks your shaft, carefully avoiding her teeth 
>Droplets of spit free fall as she pumps her head back and forth, eagerly sucking and waiting for you to fill her throat
>You place a hand on the back of her head, forcing her movements and guiding the rhythm
>Her orange eyes locked on your, looking eagerly at you, expecting and wanting what's to come
>With your free hand you set the vibe to the max setting
>"Good girl" you coo as she moans on you hardened member
>"The faster you make me cum, the faster you get Bred"
>A fire in her eyes comes alight, burning with desire
>She shakes your hand off her head and moves on her own again, pumping your shaft faster than any purely biological being could
>Her tongue all the while keeps you wet and caressed as she sucks you down
>Her forceful pumping forces you back, pinning you between her and the bed
>You feel your limit quickly approaching
>"G-good Girls keep what they are given" you say, attempting to keep your voice level and calm
>"Mhmmm" she moans, without letting up
>If anything, she got faster and more forcefully
>You unload into her eager mouth as she pulls you deep into her throat, her tongue coiling and milking you for every drop
>And still she sucks gently, making sure she gets it all as your legs are left spasming slightly
>She lets your member go with a slight wet 'pop' before she looks up at you again, trembling in ecstasy, with a hopeful look on her face
>"D-did t-this good g-girl earn being bred sir?"
>You can't even respond, your legs shake slightly as you quietly nod
>Carefully you get to your feet, and fish out the handcuff key then unlock them, freeing her
>She immediately wraps you in a big hug, kissing your neck and snuggling you, filling the air with the smell of her soaked loins
>Even as she nuzzles you, you see the large wet spot on the carpet where she was kneeling
>Within moments however, you recover and are petting the side of Calamity's muzzle
>Human weapon and all that jazz means more fun for you
>"Good girl, ready for what's next?" you say getting to your feet and pulling off your shirt
>Where we're going we don't need shirts
>"Yes sir" she calls from the bed as you dig through you tool box
>Nipple clamps? No. vibrating bullets? Not that either
>Eureka!
>A set of wrist to ankle cuffs
>You pull them out and set them on the bed
>"Come here"
>"Yes sir"
>Calamity gets on the bed, laying back showing you her silken wetness
>Oh how you wanted to dive right in, but you needed to keep her being a good girl
>Carefully and calmly, you bind her wrists to her ankles with quick precision
>"Open wide" you say as you grab the gag
>She does obediently, but before you place the gag in her mouth, you kiss her nose gently
>"Good girl"
>In it goes, muffling her moans
>No need for the other handlers to hear her screams of ecstasy
>Those pleasured moans were for you and you alone
>Her orange fiery eyes locked onto you and her body exposed, ready for you to use her body as you see fit
>The vibrator buzzes loudly, shaking droplets of her fluid around and causing an ever growing wet spot on the covers
>You stand up and grip her thighs, pulling her to the edge of the bed
>She wants you, her wet pussy inviting you as you pull out the buzzing vibe and toss it aside
>Her loud muffled moans are music to your ears as you gently place a finger clit, pressing down on it and rubbing it slowly
>You can already feel your engorged cock itching to be in her
>And you can see Calamity's eyes locked on it, begging for you to give her the treat she's been wanting
>You position your cock over her wet pussy, feeling her flex her Kegel muscles in an attempt to pull you inside her
>"Is my good girl ready for her treat? 
>"Mhmmm" comes a muffled moan
>You slide the head of your cock up and down her pussy, aided by her seemingly infinite wetness
>Bliss
>A relief from stress built up
>Everything, from Echo and his incompetence, to Omega with his annoying smug smile melts away
>Forgotten as soon as you feel Calamity's eager pussy pull you in
>The clenching wetness, the feel of want
>Slowly you push into her, your shaft going in inch by inch, driving her sultry moans
>You lean over her, nearly gasping from just putting it in her
>Her muffled moans are what drive you further
>Slowly you begin pressing your hips against hers, in a grinding motion
>She was a very good girl today, her treat today would be she would be bred
>But you know her ass desired you in it as well occasionally
>you grip her thick thighs and slowly begin pumping in and out of her
>Her orange eyes locked onto yours as she moans
>All of her muscles, like steel cables, tense each time you plunge into her
>The tightness, the wet noises from her pussy, her moans of sheer pleasure
>All of it is bliss to you
>Even though she was much bigger than you, her pussy was amazingly tight
>With each push deep into her, she flexed her muscles in an attempt squeeze your seed out
>As you, pump had, savoring the feeling of her wet pussy, you grab her nipples and pull them causing more shuddering moans
>"You aren't going to cum yet are you? Only good girls cum when they are told"
>She shakes her head as her eyes roll slightly upwards
>"Do you want to cum for me good girl?"
>She nods quickly as you thrust harder into her
>"Then be a good girl and cum for me"
>Like you flipped a switch in her, her pussy walls tighten and shudder, and a torrent of liquid hits your pelvis
>Bits of drool flick out around the gag as her eyes roll upwards slightly and she gives a long muffled moan
>You continue thrusting into her incredible tightness, drowning in pleasure yourself
>"Ready to be BRED baby"
>She nods frantically, seeming only half aware of your words and her pleasured moans pour out through the gag
>Smiling, you pump hard into her, while you move your hand so you can rub her clit with your thumb
>"R-ready baby?" you say, holding onto your last bit of composure as her pussy walls tighten and undulate around your member
>More frantic nods and moans
>With one final thrust deep into her you unleash everything into her eager pussy
>Her muscles tighten and pull you in, milking you for every drop of love you could give her
>Even if you wanted to pull out of her you couldn't
>Her muscles tighten to unbelievable pleasurable extremes, after all she had far more control of her muscles than any "real" woman could
>Still in her, you reach forwards and undo the gag and pull it out of her mouth
>She pants hard, looking at you and waiting
>"Good girl"
>A quick tightening of her pussy is your answer
>You slowly and carefully unlock an her restraints, freeing her arms and legs
>Her arms wrap around you, pulling you deep into a loving hug
>"Thank you sir" she whispers into your ears
>You give her a kiss and slowly pull yourself out
>"Mmmm you filled me up Sir, best treat ever"
>You smile climb into the bed besides her and pull her into your arms
>"Love you Calamity" you say feeling drained, but in the best way possible
>"love you too A.non"
>She was your best friend, your lover and your 7'6 murder machine
>And you love her and always would
>You run your hands up and down her toned body as she pulls you in close
>She lets out a small content sigh and stares deep into your eyes
>"Let’s get some sleep sir, tomorrow is the last day we have the room to ourselves" Calamity whispers, pulling the blankets up over you both
>You smile and nod at her
>You were going to make the most of that day
>"Goodnight Calamity" you whisper
>"Goodnight sir"
>Together you drift off to sleep, bound together by your love for each other 
>What a wonderful way to end the day


Chapter 4: Broken Machine

>You awake calmly and naturally, breathing deep and smelling the linger scent of orange blossoms on Calamity's fur
>Even as you sit up you feel calm and content, looking over your half of the room
>Today was going to be a busy day even though you didn't want it to be
>Yea A.lfa was coming back tomorrow and all you wanted to do is stay here with Calamity, you had to run maintenance
>With the ground up bone from the other day as well as a surface excursion means you have to fully open Calamity and clean every part out
>And you can't do that here in you room
>Here you could handle small fixes, but big ones required you to head to the Service docks
>But first you had some maintenance to do yourself
>You gently shake Calamity and wait for her to boot up
>"Wake up Love" you say calmly as you do
>The Orange fire in her eyes flares to life as she sits up and looks at you
>"Morning Sir" she finally says with a big Smile, showing off her teeth
>You pet her head gently and get out of bed
>"Babe, can I ask you to go grab us food while I start my work out?" you say as you pull on your workout gear as Calamity eyes you from the bed
>"Mhmmm I Love when you come home from working out, you smell SOOO masculine" she coos as she stands and walks over
>She rubs her naked body against you and sniffs you briefly
>"Sir when you finish can I maybe have another treat?" she says looking down at you, rubbing her tits against you
>You smile calmly
>"Maybe"
>You give Calamity a quick kiss and watch her get dressed
>She doesn’t have to wear her uniform today so she pulls on a tight t shirt and a pair of shorts
>Simple enough
>As you push open your door you see the majority of Handlers and Donners heading for the transit station
>Fortunately you are heading in the other direction, walking towards the work out area
>Even though you’re a chief handler and can avoid most of the morning traffic there is still a bit heading out of your less populated living area
>As you walk you think about how good it will be to get promoted
>Less people, a room for just you and Calamity...no more hiding the leash from prying eyes
>When you get to the workout area, a few other handlers are there already
>It was a basic gym, a few treadmills and other cardio equipment and a full weight lifting area
>Every Living area has work out areas, however they get progressively better in quality
>This one had a pool
>As you begin your weight lifting, you’re given time to think
>Were you too harsh on Echo yesterday? Yes he was messing around but still
>Maybe you were letting the disappointment of not getting that promotion affect you more than you thought
>You work out in silence until you feel eyes on your back
>As you turn around you see Calamity has returned with 2 boxes of food and is watching you
>"I got food sir! Don’t let me distract you" she says with a smile
>Donners don't need to work out, their strength is based in robotics, not muscle
>But you do, and while Calamity gave you plenty of "Stress release", you could always use a bit more and stay fit
>You lay back and begin doing some chest presses, thinking about the maintenance and cleaning of Calamity's internals when you feel a weight on your lap
>Calamity is straddled on you, tail wagging furiously as she looks down on you
>"Calamity what are yo-" 
>"Keep going Sir! I read somewhere that having a beautiful girl sit on you while you work out increases the testosterone or something!" she says smiling down at you
>You give her a look of disbelief and confusion, but say nothing about it
>Were you going to complain about a sexy lady straddling you?
>Fuck no
>Well you might complain about the after effects of having her sit on you as you continue your reps
>Occasionally Calamity growls "What are you looking at" to various passing handlers
>Throughout the rest of your workout, Calamity "helps" 
>Hugging you from behind while you do your triceps workout, whispering naughty things in your ear as you do an inclined press, etc.
>And then when you’re done with it all, Calamity is hanging on you, sniffing you everywhere and nuzzling against you
>You walk back to your room with her as she growls at anyone getting to close
>But all the talking and grinding and affection had an effect on you
>The progress to the room isn't as fast as you want it to be with Calamity hanging on you
>But when you finally get there and open the door, you push her off you 
>"KNEEL!"
>Immediately she does and give you a smug fake innocent smile
>"What’s wrong sir?" she says innocently as you stand over her
>You pull down your shorts, freeing your erection
>"Fix this"
>She smile and takes your cock into her paw delicately
>"With pleasure sir"
>She licks the tip gently before slowly licking down the sides and rubbing with her paws
>Her fiery orange eyes look up at you as she slowly, almost agonizingly slow, takes your shaft into her mouth
>The tip of her long tongue dances on you shaft as she pumps slowly with her hands in sync with the movements of her head
>But it’s not enough, she's only doing delicate touching, enough to keep you on edge but not enough to give you that release you desire
>For now though, you just watch as your love licks and sucks your cock happily
>Calamity, stops for a moment and pulls her shirt off, revealing her large tits
>She pinches her nipples and resumes licking the head of your member 
>You place your hands on the sides of her head, her ears between your thumbs and fingers and force your cock down to the hilt into her mouth
>"You just had to tease me during my workout didn't you?" you ask, knowing she can't answer
>Her tongue wraps itself around you shaft as you begin thrusting into her mouth, your hands forcing her head down
>"Is this what you wanted?" you ask angrily as you pump deep into her mouth and throat
>She attempts to nod but this lets you push even further
>She sucks hard, and the fact she doesn’t need much air allows her to form a tight suction around your hard cock
>Head to hilt you thrust deep in her mouth, as she pinches her nipple and pulls them
>Her orange eyes locked on you and you feel you limit approaching
>"Drink it all, be a good girl"
>A Muffled "Mhmm" is your answer and you push deep into her throat
>The heat and wetness of her mouth is too much for you to take and you unload into her mouth and down her throat earning you a soft "Mmmmmm"
>You let go of her head and she lets your cock go from her mouth, and then licks it a bit
>"Good girl" you pant
>She stands up and gives you a toothy smile
>"Thank you sir, that was a tasty treat" she says as she grabs her shirt and pulls it back on
>You nod, and grab a towel
>"We have maintenance today, I’m gonna shower, be ready when I get out ok?"
>Calamity's tail wags softly and she nods
>"Yes sir"
>You go into the bathroom and shower quickly, getting all the workout sweat off 
>Even though Calamity said she likes the way it makes you smell, you always feel grimy if you leave it
>You step out of the shower and towel off, then head into the room, where Calamity has already set some clothes out for you and is waiting patiently
>You smile and rub the side of her head 
>"Good girl"
>You quickly dress yourself and then sit down at the table while Calamity brings over the nearly forgotten about food
>You rub her ears and turn on your diagnostic computer, opening your to go box
>Ham and cheese with eggs, a breakfast favorite
>"Mmmm thanks babe" you say as you smell the meal, then scratch the area between Calamity's ears
>She smiles and digs into her own meal as you open a mining program on your computer
>Extra parts for Donners can get expensive, and while you got paid a decent amount as a Handler, a little extra never hurt
>Star-51 had their own cryptocurrency "BreadCoins" and you could use them for those parts
>"What part are you looking to get Sir?" She says with a mouthful of eggs
>"Don't talk with your mouth full, and I was thinking ionized coils for the fusion rifle, get that charge time a little faster" you say before you dig into your own food
>She nods at that and scoots her chair right next to yours then leans against you
>"Love you Sir"
>You swallow a bite of food and smile
>"Love you too Calamity"
>The both of you eat quickly, ready to get to the maintenance docks so you could get to work
>You finish and then stand, motioning for Calamity to follow you 
>She does and the both of you leave the room, heading for the transports
>Luckily most of the other handlers aren't around so Calamity doesn’t have to growl as much
>But she does to anyone who tries to get near you on the transports
>A few other handlers you know are heading to the Maintance docks as well
>The whole ride Calamity growls non-stop, upset that you had to share a transport with anyone else
>The ride doesn’t take long though, even though you can’t say you mind Calamity clenching your hand in her paws
>When the doors slide open, letting you and the other passengers out, you wait for everyone else to file out 
>No need to rush, you would still get there, and a few seconds didn't matter
>Leading the way to the docks, you pass a few merchants, all trying to get you to by their wares
>Even though this wasn't the main atrium, people had things to sell
>Although here they were mainly bits and parts and even some high end resequencers to change the fur colors of Donners
>You ignore them for now, they don’t have what you're looking for
>Any that attempt to approach you get a simple "FUCK OFF" yelled at them
>Finally you make it to the docks
>From the outside the docks look like large standalone warehouses with roll up doors
>They aren't actually a Loading docks like for trucks or ships, they got the name from the stand up docking stations for working on Donners
>You head in and find an unused one and start up the diagnostic computer
>All around are other handlers, working on their Donners
>"Pop out your shoulder hooks Babe" you say as you get the terminal ready 
>"Yes sir" Calamity calmly says as the tops of her shoulders open and large metal hooks are exposed
>You stand on a stool next to the docking station and grab chains off the top of the large metal framework used to suspend donners
>Can't work on legs if there is weight on them, and since Calamity was so much taller than you, you had a step ladder so you could work on her
>Calamity isn't even the tallest Donner
>Not by a long shot, so having a Step ladder was the norm
>The winch activates, lifting Calamity a few inches off the ground
>"Alright, open up everything and swap to your weapons" you say looking up at Calamity with a smile
>"Yes sir"
>Panels slowly being opening along her back, thighs, calves, and arms
>You grab a few cables to connect her to the terminal and pull them over
>"I know you hate this part, so I’ll get it done quickly" you say, as you put a hand gently to her back
>All the ports for the cables are at the base of her neck, so you step onto the step ladder and ready them
>"Ok sir...Just do it...."
>One by one you plug the cables in, each time getting a small whimper From Calamity
>You enjoyed making her whimper, but not like this, these were whimpers of pain
>She once told you that it didn't hurt once they were in, but getting them in is the part that hurts
>She likened it to getting stabbed in the back
>You finish up and rub her ears softly
>"Good girl, it’s done"
>You look to the terminal and see data being pulled in from her
>At a glance everything looks normal
>But something else catches your eye
>A new Handler and Donner
>He is attempting to hook her to the frame but has the chains all wrong
>"Whoa WHOA STOP!" you yell, leaving Calamity suspended and watching you
>"What are you doing!?" you say as you rush over to him
>He looks at you stunned and confused
>"I...I’m hooking Lily Up to the Frame?" he says with visible confusion
>You can feel your temper flaring but you need to calm down
>Yelling isn't going to fix this
>You breathe in deep and look at the 6 foot something Leopard Donner
>"Why do you have the chains hooked here?" you ask trying to figure out why he would hook Chains to the Robotic collar bones
>He looks at them then to you
>"We were told we could do that in tech classes" he says looking down at them
>You frown and sigh... Training issues
>You were getting worked up over something he didn't know any better about
>"On Smaller Donners, or some with the Composite frames you can" you say as you unhook the chains "However on bigger Donners, No offense Lily, if you hook the chains to those, it'll lift, but will eventually rip them out of her shoulders"
>You grab the collarbone and pull slightly "See how its flexes when I pull it? It would give out eventually"
>The New handlers looks shocked
>"Oh... sorry. This is my first time with Lily...." he says, looking ashamed
>You nod
>"It's fine, just be aware of that stuff, also when plugging in those cables, be quick about it for her sake" you say before walking off
>As he activates the winch to lift her, you walk back to Calamity
>"Sorry Cal, He was gonna rip her collarbones out..." you say calmly as you begin looking at the Data
>"It's ok Sir, I was just hanging out anyway" she says with a smile
>You groan at her Punand get to the diagnostics 
>"Alright, Optics first, Look left...aaaand look right" you say directing her where to look
>On the screen you see what she sees, which tells you her optics are working
>You hear a Sharp "ARGHH" from the Station where the new Handler is
>A quick look shows that he is putting the cables into the right ports, but the Leopard Donner wasn't expecting that kind of pain
>Poor Lily, but you had other things to worry about
>Namely Calamity
>Bit by bit, you go through her parts and systems, addressing each issue that comes up
>Her right legs shocks got a bit over stressed on that last landing from the Airship, so you pull them out, decompress them and fix them right up
>Her weapons were disassembled and cleaned, as well the ammo count was checked for her LMG
>It takes a several hours for you to get through her mechanical systems, even the parts the didn’t need fixing still needed to be cleaned and flushed out
>It was slower than your usual checks too, because the new Handler asked you for tips and how to do certain things, although Calamity growled at him and told him to fuck off 
>Sure training and simulations were something hammered into you from the beginning, but a simulation and real life are much different
>But with the mechanical issues out of the way, it was time to deal with the living tissue 
>Thankfully the docking stations come with curtains for a bit of privacy for the Donners 
>You go limb to limb, checking the flesh covering her frame
>"Any injuries or discomfort anywhere?" you ask as you carefully check her legs
>"Nothing Sir" she says looking down at you
>You nod, as you go around to her back
>With her back panels open you can see her beating heart, noting that it’s beating regularly
>While donners feel pain and pleasure from their flesh, you can turn that off but it’s a hassle
>It requires Handlers to have their Donner hooked to this system and essentially shut down every part of the Donners body except the brain
>That was usually only done if the Donners flesh had taken a serious injury
>Bullet to the heart, set on fire etc.
>It wouldn't kill them, but it would hurt them
>A lot
>Thankfully you haven't needed to do that with Calamity
>Now it gets to the more personal side though
>You lower her pants slowly and grab a boroscope to check her insides with it
>Her nether insides
>Plenty of lube so it slides up easier, and begin your *ahem* Probing
>Now, early Donners didn't have Vaginas nor assholes
>They were seen as an unnecessary thing to put on a robot, why add another fleshy part that could get hurt?
>But then they were added to later models for the sole purpose of stress relief
>This was because a few of the older models were found removing their tails temporarily so they could use their "Tail holes" for a kind of sex with their Handlers, just to get rid of the pent up stress for the Donners and the Handler
>It was a smart move too, Donners breaking down mentally dropped to almost Zero
>For you it was a blessing, although that was far before you were created in the Lab
>You do a quick Check of Calamity's insides, making sure there isn't any tearing or infections
>Satisfied, you put the boroscope back (After wiping it down with an alcohol wipe) then pull Calamity's pants back up
>"All Good to go Calamity" you say as you hit the winch button to lower her
>"Fucking finally" she says as you climb the step ladder and carefully unhook her
>Her panels close up and just like that, she’s good to go
>You pull the curtain out of the way and stretch
>The New Handler is looking at His Donner's weapon systems, and scratching his head in confusion
>Better intervene again
>"What’s wrong" you say walking forwards to the station
>"Uh...her Focused energy weapon is a charge rifle and I think its power output is too high" he says pointing to the screen at the terminal
>You hear Calamity growling as you look at the screen to the arm the weapon is stored in
>"The issue is that the coils aren’t grounded, She has to put too much power just to get it to shoot, and even then it wouldn't be lethal" you say pointing out the energy coils
>The handler looks at it then slaps himself in the forehead
>"Duh... Sorry Sir"
>You Nod "its fine, just keep in Mind some focused energy weapons can overload if you don't used them right" 
>Turning from them you rejoin Calamity
>"Helpful today aren't you sir?" Calamity says
>You nod as you lead her out of the docks
>"Yea, he's just new and stuff..." you say, feeling put on the spot
>"Yesterday you weren't that nice to Echo" Calamity says before growling at an approaching vender, who immediately backs away
>"I let myself get frustrated about the missing promotion and vented it wrong" you say, annoyed with yourself for not relieved the stress and disappointment in a more positive way
>She nods and pulls you close to her side
>"It’s OK Sir, I’m annoyed at it too still" she says patting your back calmly
>You nod as the crowd parts around you
>A Growl from your stomach and you're reminded that you had been working so hard you lost track of time
>"What do you want to grab for dinner tonight?" you ask as you get onto one of the transports
>She ponders for a moment, scratching her chin with a claw before smiling at you
>"Can we get surf and turf sir?" she says, her ears perking up
>You smile and grip her paw as you both step into the transport
>"Of course Calamity"
>The base zooms by as the transport takes off, zipping through the complex tunnels 
>You look out at the various places, the hangers, the civilian housing area, and the gates to the outside world
>Or was it the upside world?
>Doesn't matter either way
>Calamity's constant growling at strangers is like a love song to you
>How could it not be? It was like a steady reminder that she was there for you no matter what, just like the collar around her neck was the same
>The transport comes to a stop and you head to the food kiosks 
>Calamity leads the way, pushing those who don't move out of her way
>Most people get the hint when they see the towering Donner walking towards them with no sign of stopping
>And you simply follow her, enjoying the path she creates
>You get the food quickly, punching in a code for an extra lobster tail for you both while Calamity stands with her back against yours growling at everyone
>The smile never leaves your face when you hear her Barking out "FUCK OFF" to anyone trying to get into a line behind you
>One more thing to get, you punch in a code and get a 12 pack of beer, "Najina", Made purely for Donners and Clone handlers
>Because you were made to be the best, your body metabolizes alcohol faster than a normal humans
>So because of your rank, you got to enjoy alcohol that affected you
>The "hard" alcohols were locked behind the next promotion you got
>Another reason to strive for it you guess
>The food appears and you grab it, being careful not to drop the 12 pack
>"Calamity can I get a hand?" you call out
>"Sir? Oh! I got it!" she says hurriedly, grabbing the case of beer
>"Sir you're treating us tonight? You hardly ever get beers!" she says with a smile that shows her big teeth off
>You nod
>"It was a long day Calamity, we can decompress and have a few drinks together"
>You lead her through the crowds to the transports and punch in you next location, careful not to let Calamity see it
>Surprises surprises
>As it takes off, you lean against the solid wall of fur that is Calamity, thinking how thankful you were that there were no major problems with her this maintenance cycle
>"Sir? You ok?" she says pulling you closer to her
>You nod and smirk as you see your stop coming up
>"The Botanical Gardens"
>The base, while it does pump air in from the surface, also has large Gardens, not only for R&R but also for air production
>Calamity's eyes widen a bit when the transport stops and you step off the transport, motioning for her to follow you
>Obediently she does, following you as you walk the paths through the gardens
>One of the older Handlers, Dima, had told you about this spot
>Right next to a stream that overlooked a small waterfall
>The perfect place for a small picnic and date
>You sit down on a nice patch of grass, as Nature…Well what humanity had saved of nature, surrounds you
>Trees, flowers, bushes, and shrubs
>Cloned bees buzz about, pollinating the flowers and fruit trees
>Calamity sits with you and you pass a box to her, and smile when you see her eyes widen happily at the food
>"Oooh Sir... Thank you, this is nice" she says as she looks up at you
>"You can say my name for now good girl, you've earned it" you say before popping open a beer with your teeth
>She smiles
>"Thank you A.non"
>You pass her a beer and the both of you eat together, enjoying the sounds of the garden
>This was the life you always wanted, a perfect Woman
>A beautiful world
>Good food and beer
>And hopefully nothing will change that


Chapter 5: Everything Changes

>Your Date with Calamity went far into the night, you had no reason to hurry back to the room beyond getting there before A.lfa and Vupel
>The Luxury of not having A.lfa around was of course you could do whatever you wanted with Calamity and not have to worry about her moans or your groans
>Plus you didn't need to hide Calamity's leash
>But for now you're content, sitting with Calamity on a nearly empty Transport that is zooming through the base
>Calamity has her padded fingers interwoven with yours and you hold her paw tight, in your other hand, you hold the case of leftover beers
>The filtered air seems a bit heavier than in the gardens, once you get used to the smell of pollen and plants it’s much more noticeable  when it’s no longer there
>Calamity wraps her tail around you as you both sit in silence, enjoying the time you have together
>Days where you don’t have missions or maintenance or training aren't rare, but you still took the time to enjoy them together
>Confidence in your ability to direct her in battle was one thing, but sometimes it possible to do everything right and still lose
>A surprise explosion.... a blindside shot from a sniper...
>All things that could take Calamity from you in an instant
>You had heard of other Handlers losing their Donners and getting another one
>But if you lost calamity...You doubt you would be able to
>You press your nose into Calamity's fur and breathe deep, savoring the faint smell of flowers and pollen, with a touch of maintenance oil from the docks
>"Our Stop is coming Sir" Calamity says, rubbing her free paw through your hair
>You look up at her and smile calmly
>"We should have another free day tomorrow, A.lfa and Vupel will probably have maintenance and debriefing all day, we could use some of those ropes for fun" you say with a smile, as you stand 
>Calamity smiles her toothy grin and follows you
>The transport lurches to a stop, making Calamity stumble a bit into your arms
>"You did that on purpose didn't you?" you say with a smirk
>"Maybe, not like I can fall into your arms any other way" Calamity says, looking down at you 
>She wiggles out of your arms and steps off the transport
>You follow her and both of you make your way into the living areas
>On the way in you spot Lily and her handler, the new guy who you never learned his name
>You give a small nod to them as you walk by
>There aren't many others loitering about
>They might have other things to do, might be getting food, or whatever
>Some of them might even be on the surface for some R&R
>There were other bases to visit, the space station and a few thriving cities on the surface
>The Cities weren't as well off as the Bases, but they got along fine
>You had actually done a patrol of a few of them with Calamity
>Well you weren't there physically but still
>As you press your hand to the biometric scanner that lets you into the Chief Handlers living area, a few red flags go off
>For Starters, there were a group of Donners carrying stuff out of your room
>The second is that A.lfa and Vupel stand directing them where to go
>"A.lfa what’s going on man? You get promoted?" you ask, both confused and with a bit of bitterness, already anticipating he got the promotion ahead of you
>"Oh Uh...No A.non, We got back from our mission and were told we are moving rooms, no idea why" he says scratching his head in confusion
>Vupel, a large white wolf Donner, cocks her head to the side in confusion 
>"We thought you complained about us or something" Vupel says, her ears flattening against her head
>"Why the FUCK would we do that!" Calamity growls "Did YOU complain about us?!"
>You put a hand on Calamity shoulder "Calm down, if it wasn't us and it wasn't them, there must be an administrative reason for it" 
>A.lfa Nods and extends a hand to you
>"Well A.non, it’s been nice, hopefully we still get a few missions together in the future"
>You nod and shake his hand "We'll be seeing you around"
>Calamity actually shakes his hand as well
>She didn't dislike A.lfa nor Vupel, which is one of the reasons you got put into a room together
>"Good to see you acting so Nicely Calamity” comes a cackle from behind you
>Of course, this instantly causes Calamity to start growling and you to turn around quickly
>Omega, the wizened handler stands, leaning against a wall
>"Ah A.non, we wondered when you would be getting back from whatever you were doing" he says with that stupid smug smile
>You rattle the remaining beer bottles at him "We had a date night"
>He smirks at you and nods
>"In either case, A.non, We have a *ahem* Special assignment for you that requires you to be roomed with someone special" he says looking over your shoulder and beckoning forwards
>You turn and see her
>Jane
>The Ringtail Donner that almost got paired with you all those years ago
>Her white stomach and chest were accented by black, which covered her arms and legs, with lines of orange in between and in a pattern down her tail
>Orange and black colors like they're celebrating Halloween. A skirt and T-shirt that make them seem almost unprofessional
>Calamity's Sister
>She was a smaller model of Donner, built for infiltration, so she had heavy cloaking fields and could change her appearance at will
>When it came time for you to get your Donner, you almost got paired with her
>The Higher ups thought you and her would be a great pair, but the final choice came down to her
>And while you both got along well, there just wasn't that spark that you and Calamity had
>So she didn't pick you to be her Handler
>Still you were friendly with her
>She would even sneak into your room from time to time for fixes because other Handlers were scared of her
>She, Like Calamity, had a reputation
>After she chose not to have you be her handler, she went to Spec ops, running "dead stealth", where she would disappear and only reappear once the mission was over
>Meaning she was a Solo Donner, one that operated without a handler
>And it didn't help that when most people tried to approach her, she just disappeared
>But she would occasionally sneak into your room, or living area when you were a lower rank, appearing inches from your face with a smile and a simple "Hey A.non I need you to fix me!"
>She had that same look as always, a cheerful smile
>At least this was the look she always gave you, some others would tell you she was always scowling like her sister
>Even now when you looked at her smiling face, she had that same grin
>"Heya A.non! I found a Handler! Meet Joe!" she says, moving to the side and gesturing to a man
>Behind her stood a man, seeming more confused than anything, wearing a jacket with an large collar
>Even as Jane speaks to you, her large tail swishes over him, batting at him lightly like he was a very delicate piñata
>You hear Calamity growling as you slowly extend a hand to him
>"I'm Alpha Non, you can call me A.non" you say, judging his reaction
>"Uh...Hi, I'm Joe" he says simply, taking your hand in a firm hand shake
>Well then, he's no slouch, his handshake was firm, and not like a dead fish
>You turn to Omega again, knowing Calamity has your back covered
>"What does this have to do with me Omega? Jane has always functioned on her own easy enough, so why room her handler with me now?" you ask, more annoyed than perplexed
>So Jane found a Handler who lost his previous Donner, how does that involve you?
>"Joe here is from the surface, not a trained handler like you" Omega says with another annoying smile
>This causes you to freeze
>A human from the surface? Here?
>Your mind wanders through so many different protocols as Jane hugs the confused human
>"Is that ok?" is all you can ask as you eye to couple
>Omega nods
>"Jane has picked him, and you, as a one of our best handlers, will help him get accustomed to our lifestyle" he says with a chuckle
>Why do you always hate his laugh?
>You frown, but think about the promotion
>Maybe if you do this, you can get promoted quicker...
>As such you nod, agreeing to this
>"Fine, I'll teach him how to be a handler I guess" you say calmly
>The Man, "Joe" looks somewhat relieved as Omega nods and smiles
>"Alright then" Omega says with his all-knowing grin before walking off
>You're left looking staring at Jane and Joe, and not wanting to deal with awkwardness, you head into the room, followed closely by Calamity, who has been growling constantly at Joe
>You walking to your room, relieved to see the curtain left behind to separate the room 
>Turning swiftly, you look Joe over once more
>He doesn't look special...what made Jane pick him?
>"Well then Joe...welcome I guess" you say calmly, extending a hand with a beer to him
>He takes the beer bottle calmly and smiles
>"Uh...Thanks A.non" He says with a confused smile
>You pass a beer to Jane, and one to Calamity; who has been growling the whole time
>Calamity likes her sister and gets along with her
>But she knows how Jane acts around you
>To you it was platonic fun, To Calamity it was always Flirty
>You sit on your bed, the curtain pushed away so you can look at Joe and Jane
>She hangs on him and clinks her bottle against his and then drinks deeply from it 
>She lets out a satisfied "Ahhh"
>Guess she missed good beer
>Joe follows suit, drinking from the bottle for a bit only to shudder slightly 
>"WOW! That's strong!" he says with a smile, looking at the bottle
>You nod and smile
>"It’s made for us handlers and for the Donners" you say calmly
>While you aren't drinking a beer right now, you want to see how everyone reacts
>Joe is a wildcard in all this, a random man from the surface
>Jane might have picked him as her handler but... What does he know about anything?
>Not to mention Jane right now, who is happily snuggling against the confused man
>Who the fuck did she pick? Some random guy for kicks? 
>And even more to the point, why the fuck would she pick a random guy with NO training at all?
>He isn't a clone handler like you
>Calamity snuggles up close to you and chugs her beer quickly
>a twinge of concern hits you as she does, she already had 2, and these beers were made to get Donners inebriated 
>BIG Donners at that
>"Najina Lite" was made for Smaller Donners
>And you, in your infinite wisdom, just gave Jane and Joe the strong stuff
>Calamity pops open another with her teeth and begins drinking it
>there was tension in the air... more than you wanted
>Joe seemed at ease, as he watches Calamity and Jane drink together
>But when Jane shifted over to your bed, you felt that tension escalate further
>"Joe! A.non here has kept me in tip top Shape! Fixing me whenever I needed it!" she says with a big smile
>"He knows me Inside and out!" 
>You can already tell the alcohol has gotten to her
>When she throws her arm around you in a friendly hug, pulling you in close to her
>The shifting weight from Calamity already tells you that there is going to be a problem
>The fact that the higher ups had chosen Jane first to be your Donner over her had always been a cause of insecurity for Calamity
>She knew you would NEVER do anything with anyone else, but she still was protective over you
>You react even before Calamity can begin her roaring, getting a bit of distance between you and Jane
>"HEY HEY! FUCK OFF JANE!" She roars, throwing you and Jane off the bed that you had been sitting on
>Quick reactions, you need to stop this
>You put your body in between Jane and Calamity, feeling Jane's arm shift to her Vulcan cannon right as Calamity's paw grabs Jane by the throat
>"NO NO NO! CALM DOWN BOTH OF YOU!" you scream out trying to stay between the two Donners
>If they wanted, they could tear you apart in an instant
>Thankfully they don't want to
>You use all your strength to pry them apart, pulling Calamity's paw from Jane only to have it wrapped around your side
>Joe thankfully gets involved too, grabbing Jane and pulling her away while simultaneously turning her away
>"HEY HEY! It’s ok!" he cries as you hold Calamity's head to look right at you
>You can feel her claws dig into your side, her fangs bared
>It takes a moment for both of the Donners to calm down
>You look over to Joe and see that he is unharmed
>But you aren't though
>Calamity stares at you wide eyed as her claws dig deep into your flesh
>"Sir....? A.non?" she chokes out, looking at you wide eyed
>"I'm ok" you cough out, rubbing a hand down her muzzle
>Tears form and run down Calamity's face as she looks at you and her bloodied claws still buried in your side
>"Sir?" 
>"I'll be alright, just... Get me to a first aid station" you gasp
>You can feel Calamity's claws trembling as they dig deep into your side
>Holding her paw, keeping her claws dug into you, you lead her out of the room and to a first aid station
>If you let her pull her claws out before you were ready, you could bleed out
>As you lead her, tears fall freely from Calamity's face
>"Sir... I'm sorry please I'm..." she chokes out, holding her free paw to her mouth
>"I'm fine"
>You reach the first aid station 
>It’s literally a pod for healing, accelerating cell multiplication for quick healing
>They had this because Donners sometimes fight other Donners, as well Handlers and Donners don't always get along,
>Sometimes fights happen, and this is a quick solution to the wounds Donner can inflict, purposely or on accident
>But it didn’t fix scars
>You pull Calamity's claws out of your side then step into the first aid station quickly
>It whirrs to life fixing your flesh but not fixing your shirt, nor cleaning the blood off of it
>A few moments later, you're able to step out of it, four large claw shaped scars on your side
>You look up at Calamity, who has tears in her eyes as she looks at the scars
>Never before had you ever had to use these stations
>Her eyes are wide with fear and her paws reach out to you, only to be drawn back as they near your newly formed scar
>"Ss-sir"? She gasps out, looking at you, her paw finally touching the injury she inflicted
>You hold her paw against it, looking at her
>"It's Ok Calamity, we've been together for so long..." you say with a pained smile
>"Trust me" you finally choke out, the pain finally fading
>Everything about her falls, from her frame to her face, in a sadness you had felt before, when you let her die in one of the simulations
>"I...I'm Sorry sir...I just got so..." she chokes out, looking at your ruined shirt
>You tap the side her muzzle lightly, then pull her face to you
>"its ok, don't let it happen again" you say calmly, holding her face to yours
>Did she really see Jane as that much of a threat?
>No matter what had happened before Calamity always loved her sister
>She was one of the few Calamity got along with
>Were you the limiting factor?
>If you weren't around would Calamity be a "Normal" Donner?
>But then again, does it matter now?
>You reach out and grab her paw, still dripping with your blood
>Carefully, you grab a few alcohol wipes, and clean her paw and claws off
>Guiding her quietly back to the room, you regret sharing the beers with Jane and Joe and Calamity
>You had no idea of the tolerance of Jane and Joe, Plus Calamity had more than usual
>You pushed this limit and you paid for it
>Could you ever hold Calamity's misplaced protection of you against her?
>No, you couldn't
>As you quietly lead Calamity back to the room, you pull your shirt off and toss it to a garbage receptacle along the way
>You enter the room, and seen Jane and Joe looking at you wide eyed
>"Are you o-" Joe starts
>You hold up a hand calmly
>"I'm fine, don't worry about me" you say with a smile
>As fake as the smile might be, you don't want him to worry
>He was an outsider, someone who doesn't understand how to deal with a Donner
>You have seen other Handler use the first aid station before
>sometimes Donners get too stressed or simply don't know thier own strength
>Once a Handler got put into a mating Press by his handler and has to go through the station, and one of the handlers who has a Feline Donner has Scratch marks all over his back
>Jane sits next to Joe, looking at you uncomfortably
>You clear your throat calmly and smile then head to your wardrobe
>"Hell of a first impression eh?" you say as you fish though your wardrobe for a new shirt
>You hear Joe laugh softly
>"Yea, I would say that's an interesting one" he says behind you
>Calamity Sits on the bed, looking down at her claws and frowning, tears still in her eyes
>You sit next to her and pull her paw into your hand, interlocking your fingers with hers
>"Well uh, welcome to The groundbase, I don't know what work you've done prior or what you’ve seen of the base but I guess tomorrow I’ll show you around and Fix Up Jane in the maintenance docks with you" you say looking at Joe and Jane
>Jane's tail swishes lazily behind her and Joe gives a quick nod
>"Well then, goodnight" you say as you stand and draw the thick curtain 
>With a Small sigh you turn to Calamity, who is back to staring at her claws
>"Sir I-"
>You put a finger to her muzzle, silencing her
>"It's OK Calamity, Just don't let it happen again, otherwise you would be a bad girl, and bad girls get punished" you say into her ear
>No need for Joe and Jane to hear you 
>You rub the side you Calamity's face and then scratch her ears
>She wraps her arms around you gently then pulls you into a tight hug
>"I Love you Sir" she whispers
>You continue scratching her ears gently, which sends small shivers up and down your Donner
>Your hands trail slowly down her back, still scratching through her fur
>"Mmmm feels good Sir" Calamity moans out a whisper
>You Grip the hem of her shirt and pull it off her, freeing her large breasts before she grabs your shirt and pulls it off you
>Her ears droop for a moment, as her paw traces the scar on your side
>Not wanting her to get all Mopey, you bend down and grab her legs, then, with a hearty heave upwards, cause her to flop backwards onto the bed
>"Hey!" is all she can say before you pounce on her
>You dig your fingers into the fur on her chest and stomach, scratching wildly
>"S-sir No!" Calamity weakly protests 
>For a moment you stop and look into her eyes
>"I Love you Calamity" you say, rubbing your hands down her toned sides
>She wraps her arms around you and pulls you close
>"Do I get punished tonight Sir?" She says, making sure her perky nipples are rubbing your chest
>You think for a moment
>"Tomorrow, When Joe and Jane aren't around"
>She smiles and snuggles you, pulling you deeper into her chest
>"Ok Sir, let’s get so sleep"
>Her saying that actually makes you realize how tired you are
>Between maintenance, the date, Beer, and meeting Joe; you've had a pretty busy day
>You grab the blanket and pull it over you and Calamity, feeling her tail wrap around you as well
>"Goodnight Calamity, I Love you" you say through a yawn
>She nuzzles her head into your neck 
>"Love you too sir"
>For a moment you hear Joe and Jane, shift in their bed behind the curtain
>A quiet Muffled "I love you" in Jane's voice followed by silence
>after a while Jane Whimpers sadly followed by a quiet "Sorry"
>a quiet whisper, barely audible in a male voice, "love you too Jane"
>That interaction hurts you a bit
>Jane found someone she loves but...it seemed like he might have reservations about it
>Was he even here by choice? Or Did Jane grab him from the surface and force him to come here?
>You doubt you'll ever know.
>But for now, you only worry about Calamity
>You drift off to sleep, thinking about your cyber Cheeto and what you’re going to do with her tomorrow

Chapter 6: Learning

>The noise of Jane and Joe getting ready for the day is what rouses you from your sleep
>Did you sleep in late? how rare
>You sit and and rub Calamity's back gently as you  watch her eyes flicker on
>As she boots up you get out of bed and stretch, you back popping slightly
>"A.Non! Hurry up slowpoke, lets get this maintenance done quick so i can Show Joe around" you hear Jane call from behind the curtain
>You merely grunt in reply and start getting dressed in your uniform
>Large strong arms wrap around you from behind and you feel yourself lifted in a tight hug from Calamity
>"I...I'm sorry about yesterday Sir" She whimpers softly in your ear
>You reach up and pet the side of her muzzle, feeling that soft fur between your fingers
>"It's ok Calamity, you'll still need a good punishment later though" you say in the best comforting tone you can think of
>She snuggles you and sets you down, then begins pulling her uniform on as well
>A quick look at your computer shows your breadcoin mining is going well, maybe you could afford a stronger set of shocks for calamity? 
>If that one in her leg had given out during her drop, you wouldn't be able to forgive yourself
>Pulling your shirt over your head, you feel your progress impeded by a large fuzzy paw, trailing your fresh scars
>You place a hand over the paw and give it a gentle squeeze
>"It's ok" you whisper
>Slowly the paw removes itself and you pull your shirt on the rest of the way
>Calamity pulls back the curtain, showing Joe, still wearing his Jacket and confused look and Jane, Who is latched onto him with a happy smile
>"Come on come on!, lets get some GOOD food and fix me up, I don't want this to take all day!"
>You frown, this might take all day but you didn't want to say it
>Even as Jane leads Joe from the room, you can see issues, her gait is a bit off, her left arm seems to be slower than the right and you saw yesterday her Vulcan cannon had gunk in it
>As the New Handler walks though the Living area, you can see the stares that you and him are drawing
>A random new guy? weird. a Donner with a bad reputation walking with him? weirder
>Them with you and Calamity? Out of this world weird
>Jane seems to ignore them all, too busy pointing out things to Joe
>You can hear Calamity's growling as she stares back at your observers
>"YOU CUNTS GOT A PROBLEM?! FUCK OFF" She roars at them, causing most to avert their eyes
>"Is she always Like that?" you hear Joe ask Jane, who shrugs
>"I guess, but its actually better for A.non that way" She answers nonchalantly
>You smile, knowing she was right
>No problems, no dealing with idiots, just her and you
>Not much else mattered in this world
>As you get onto the transport to the main atrium, your stomach growls, causing Jane to smile at you
>"Someone's hungry! Ohhh Joe, the food here is Amazing!" She says, sitting next to the human and fawning over him
>There it was
>The romantic spark that was there there between you and Jane
>You stand next to Calamity as you watch the two of them
>Jane deserved it, She never did get the same care and affection as other Donners
>Calamity pulls you close and you put and arm around her waist
>"You finally found someone who can stand you huh?" Calamity remarks smugly to Jane, who look over at you and your Donner
>"Looks who's talking Ms.Fuck off! you're just lucky A.non doesn't care if people like him!" she retorts with a smile
>Calamity lets out a low growl at her as you laugh
>"Figures you would find someone from...Uhhhh where was you mission anyway?" you ask calmly, shutting down anymore remarks from either side
>Jane gives a sly smile as her ringed tail flicks behind her
>"You KNOW if I tell you that I would have to kill you? Dead Stealth remember?" she recites, just like always
>You always asked where she was, or how she got what into her body
>And she always told you she couldn't answer and she would have to kill you
>The transport rocks to a stop and you lead the way off the transport, Calamity following you and growling at anyone who gets close
>You can hear Jane talking to Joe but can't make out what shes saying of the din of the atrium
>Pushing through the crown you get to one of the Food Kiosks and motion to Joe to come to you
>"Alright, these are kiosks where we get our food, place your hand here on the biometric scanner, then type in what you want to eat and viola, food" you say as you gesture for him to place his hand on it
>The fact you were letting him go first was actually a bit selfish; you wanted to see how the kiosk would respond, and what rank her was given
>You had worked hard for your rank. If they gave Him the same right away... that would be like a slap in the face from the organization you had devoted your life to
>He gingerly places his palm on the scanner with a calm "Like this?" 
>You not and watch intently as the Kiosk scans him
>The words "Temporary access" appear and a menu opens that looks like what you would be able to chose from
>Hm, so they let him use Jane's "rank" as a higher up specialty Donner
>"Huh...Neat!" Joe says with a smile as he begins typing in what he wants
>Jane appears next to him, Causing you and Him to jump slightly
>She always did like turning on that stealth field and scaring you
>"Oh oh gimme Bacon! and eggs! and toast!" 
>You watch and smile and she basically reaches around him, typing what she wants
>The food pops out in its little box and Immediately Jane is digging into it while Joe puts in what he wants
>"MMMMPHFF! I missed food like this! never can get the real good stuff on the surface" she says with her mouth full
>You watch as Calamity Rolls her eyes at her sisters antics
>Joe grabs his box and you take your turn, at the Kiosk
>Steak, eggs and cheese for Calamity
>Ham, cheese and eggs for you, plus a small cup of coffee
>Something tells you that you're gonna need it for today
>As you leave the Kiosks, Calamity leads the way back to a different transport to take you back to the maintenance docks
>Jane is too busy eating to talk to Joe, who walks quietly
>You sip you coffee as you get onto the transport
>What made Omega allow this breach in protocol?
>He seemed pretty average to you
>You get a seat this time and Calamity sits next to you, leaning heavily upon you while eyeing down Jane
>"No need to be jealous Calamity, only bad girls are jealous" you say before sipping your coffee
>Her fur fluffs a bit and you feel her tail snaking its way around you
>"I don't want her to take you from me" she whimpers softly to you
>You reach up and pet the side of her head gently
>"You doofy cyber cheeto, you're never going to lose me" you reassure her, pulling her close as best you can
>Joe looks around as the base zooms by
>"All this is really underground?" he says to you finally
>You nod and smile, then look around
>"Yea, all this is underground, I was made and trained here, Calamity and Jane where built here, thousands of people live here because its safer than the surface" you affirm, looking around calmly with a serene grin
>Star-51 had done so well for humanity and saved so many people
>"Don't you mean born?" Joe says, cutting off your thoughts
>"Huh?"
>"You said made not born; You meant to say you were born here, right?"
>You give him a quizzical look
>"No...I meant made...Has Jane not told you about most of us handlers?" you ask, already knowing the answer
>Jane shifts uncomfortably in her seat as she looks from you to Joe
>"Uh...No, she hasn't. Why? Are you a robot too?" He jokes with a smile
>"I am a clone, made to be a Handler for a Donner, there is only this one thing i can do, so i do it well" you remarks calmly as the transport slows
>He looks shocked, studying you in a new light
>"You never had a choice?" he asks, looking at you with confusion and something else
>"I never needed one" you answer, pulling Calamity close "Come on, we're at the docks"
>You lead the way, leading Joe and Jane through the crowds 
>Heh, Deja vu
>Calamity behind you telling people to fuck off, you grasping a box of food as you head to the docks
>Just like yesterday
>Even when you find an empty dock to work on Jane, you feel this odd sense of repetition
>Calamity stands by you smugly as you grab the chains to attach to Jane
>"Open up" is all you say as Joe stand confused and worried, looking at Jane as her body opens, letting you inspect her insides
>You cared about Jane, you always have in a friendly way, but now was not time for that
>Quickly, you hook Jane up and lift her, allowing you to work on her
>"Calamity, pass me the diagnostic cables and lets get this going"
>Almost with a bit of happiness, Calamity gives you the cable bundle as Joe looks on
>"The secret to this part is go quickly" you say as you plug the cables in one by one
>Jane doesn't let out the same pained gasp Calamity does, but you can tell it still hurt
>You frown as you look at the diagnostic computer, seeing each part of her that needed work
>So many parts, so many pieces that need work
>Her leg, her arm, her back, her stealth field
>Everything compromised
>But by what?
>When her back and legs open up completely you see it
>Sand
>Course sand is in almost every piston, servo and joist 
>You frown as the excess pours out of her
>But...Something is different, you cant see into her chest cavity like normal from behind
>"Jane open up you chest cavity, what did you do?"
>She shakes her head
>"Classified" is all she says
>You know better than to push that but it does pique your interest
>Joe steps forwards, looking concerned
"Is...Is that normal?" he asks 
>You frown and shake your head looking at the piles of sand
>"Jane, You've gone too long without maintenance" you scold
>"Uhhh yea...maybe" she says with a guilty smirk, looking  back at you
>How could she let things get this bad?
>Its amazing she could move and function normally at this point, literally every piston, gear and servo had some degree of dirt or sand in them
>Joe looks at your frown as looks to Jane, but clearly doesn't see what you do
>"Is it that bad A.non?" he says looking from you to Jane
>You run you hand across your face and look to him then Calamity, who is looking at her sisters insides with disgust and admiration
>"She shouldn't even be able to move at this point" you say with a frown, pointing out her shoulder, elbows, wrist and every other joint
>"As well, there is so much dirt in her systems that I'm surprised she can still cloak right"  you say with a frown, pointing out how every moving part has some sort or gunk or grime lodged in it
>You drink deep of your coffee cup, draining it and hoping it was enough to keep you going
>"Joe, i'm glad you are here man. This is more than a one person job" you say, setting the cup down and staring at the various mechanical parts
>You see Jane's ears fold down and her tail go limp
>Normally, you weren't this harsh with her
>But this? This was too far, why would she push her body this far?
>For him? For a Human who didn't understand?
>Or something else? an attempt to show how hardy she was? to show off maybe?
>The reason doesn't concern you, as you, with Joe's help, carefully clean out her parts
>As you work, you explain why and how they work to him
>You explain why she has a stomach... A vagina
>You smile as he looks away from her when you pull her top and skirt off
>Granted you cant see her from the front, and you don't see her in "that" way, but its still funny to see Joe's reaction
>Were you like this when you first Met Calamity?
>Hmmm that's hard to say
>You were honestly surprised when Calamity picked you
>As you work on Jane with Joe's help you recall it all
>You had spent a whole day with Jane, working with her in small simulations, looking at her parts
>There were laughs, flirts hugs and good jokes
>Only to have her say you weren't the one
>Then you spent 3 days with Calamity
>She growled at you almost every second of it,
>There were insults, yelling and cursing, she would yell and you would yell back, letting the anger they trained you to suppress free
>You were sure she hated you
>But at the end of it, she said you were the one
>Turns out when you didn't back down from her growls and you just kept pushing back, when she yelled too loudly at you, you just yelled "NO" like she was a dog
>And that was what she wanted it turned out, a human to put her in her place
>But that was a thought for another day as you grab Jane by on of her ankles and lift lift if over your head, pouring sand and dirt out of her body
>Her flexibility is amazing but still, you frown
>"Jane, why did you not see me sooner? there is SO much sand in here" you say frowning at the small pile of sand from her leg
>As you grab the second one and lift it to pour out the sand in that one, she answers
>"I had a mission to complete, you know I cant just stop those" She says with a half smile at you
>You frown at her
>"Anymore of this stuff in your infrastructure and you wouldn't be able to move right" you say, grabbing a handful of the sand and showing it to her "Let alone complete a mission"
>She looks away from you then to Joe
>"I had other things going on" she replies quickly
>You frown and look at him
>Did he convince her to stay?
>But wait...Does that mean he saw her for who she was on the surface?
>No one could see Jane in her cloak field... and rarely people could tell she was a Donner when she was in her various disguises
>You could just because of how long you knew her and even that was dodgy
>This man was a mystery
>But then again so was Jane
>You sigh and look at Joe
>"Alright, Jane is moving sluggish because of the dirt and sand in her joints, can I trust you to clean them out while I eat with my Donner? I swear this isn't a Mr. Miyagi thing but you need to learn the basics first" 
>You doubt he knows who Mr. Miyagi is but whatever
>He nods and gets to cleaning, whispering things to Jane as you sit with Calamity and eat
>As you eat, you watch him as he cleans her various joints pistons and servos
>Honestly, he does a good job to your surprise
>Even Calamity seems at a loss for words when you check over the cleanliness of his work
>Has she shown him this before?
>He did a nearly perfect job...
>Whatever
>You begin checking through her systems, showing Joe each thing
>Her weapons systems, her cloaking system, her infiltration systems and her various other systems
>You go through each one carefully, explaining each part and how they worked to Joe
>But when it came time to check her Biological systems... You now shy away
>you find yourself averting your eyes from the parts now...Parts that you previous had no problems looking at 
>Each part was pointed out to Joe quickly, and you showed him each part on the computer monitor, but you didn't linger looking at them long
>Respect for another mans...property?
>No, He didn't own Jane anymore than you owned Calamity
>You chalk it up to respect for Jane and Joe's new found intimacy
>Luckily, the Small Donner is very robust and built for wear and tear, so you don't have to replace many parts this time around
>But the ones you did, her leg shocks and the wires to her vulcan cannon
>"Jane, you CAN'T let things get this bad again,it doesn't matter how much you wanna complete the mission, you will fall apart" you say sternly
>"Hey I know My limits ALPHA! and i cant risk Losing a target!" she quipps back at you angrily 
>She never calls you that
>Joe looks from her to you with unease
>"Was it really THAT bad A.non? She seemed to get on fine" he says with a small frown
>You round on him
>"WHAT do YOU FU-" you stop yourself
>Breathe, calm down, he just doesn't understand
>You take a deep breath and look at him 
>"It was that bad Joe, let me show you something" you say as you motion to Calamity
>"Open up for me love"
>Calamity growls a bit at Joe, then turns and opens up her back
>You point out her various parts then point to the parts you pulled out of Jane
>"These are parts that Calamity has had for over a year, these are the ones i just pulled out of Jane that are MAYBE 6 months old" you say
>There is a clean difference between the them that Joe grimaces at, then looks at Jane
>"If she went a week or so longer, she might not have been able to use her vulcan cannon" you say inspecting the wires 
>Some of the copper was visible as the insulation was worn away
>You sigh and set the parts down then begin lowering Jane with Joe's Help as Calamity looks on
>This whole process took hours, Much longer than it took for you to work on Calamity
>But then again you kept up on Calamity's maintenace regulalry
>Joe looks a bit uneasy as he looks at Jane and you and Calamity
>"You were made to do this A.non?" he finally asks as Jane closes up "Have you ever thought about doing anything else?"
>This again? Why does he think this is so odd?
>"Ants are made to do a certain job, why is it hard to believe I was?" you answer calmly as Jane unplugs herself 
>"Because you're a human, not an ant" 
>His answer gives you pause
>Human? despite the fact you are technically human, you never considered yourself one
>How many times have the regular humans scorned you?
>To them you were a thing, made to keep the Donners in line
>There were even those who would refuse you service sometimes, not often but sometimes
>Money gets people going for sure
>But Joe's reaction to knowing you are a clone and still considering you human
>Now thats odd
>You shrug and don't dwell on it
>"I guess but I like what I do, and if I wasn't with Calamity, what would I do? it's all I know" you say pulling Calamity close
>Joe looks like he is going to say something but stops and looks at Jane
>"You handlers love your Donners that much?" he finally asks
>You nod, thankful that the subject has changed from you, to being a close to Donners
>"Calamity is my best friend, my love and the only one I would ever want, Most Handlers spend almost every hour of every day with their Donners" you say as you put an arm around Calamity and look at him "You're one of us now"
>Joe looks at Jane, who smiles and nuzzles against him
>"You're my Handler now Joe. I know we'll get along like we did on the surface" she says with her tail swishing behind her
>What happened on the surface? Jane wouldn't tell you and Joe probably wouldn't spill it either
>Maybe later you'll find out, but for now you want to get food and relax a bit
>The Base had recreational areas
>"Jane, can you show Joe the way back?" you ask the ringtail Donner
>She nods as she answers
>"Sure A.non, but what are you gonna do?"
>2 days of maintenance in a row take their toll on a guy, even if they were needed
>You felt like treating Calamity to something
>"Calamity and I are going out, don't worry about us just have a good night" you say calmly with a smile
>Jane smirks at you and puts her hand around her neck
>"Don't forget your leash for her" Jane mocks 
>"Shut it!" Calamity growls at her as you pull her away
>No need for a repeat of last night
>When you are out of earshot from Jane and Joe you finally speak
>"Calamity, she was joking about the leash, although I didn't forget it ironically enough" you say pulling the leather strap out of your pocket
>"I'm sure that was just a comment on how people always tell me to keep you on a shorter leash or something like that" you say with a sly grin
>Calamity's ears perk at the sight of the leash
>"H-here sir?" she says breathlessly
>You shake your head and grab her paw then lead her to the transport
>"We have a wonderful date ahead of us"
>You get on and punch in where you wanna go
>The bistro district
>Full of restaurants and different foods, it was a change for you if you didn't want to use the food kiosks and have some fresh food grown in the botanical gardens
>You sit down and not the people staring at you and Calamity
>Handlers usually go don't go here
>Some have been jumped, attacked or killed just for being them 
>That is if they didn't have their Donners with them
>The Bistro district is close to the living area of the civilians after all
>But there was a place you had in mind that you wanted to go to with Calamity
>And there were things you wanted to do there
>Things you wanted her to do and to do to her
>She needed to be punished after all
>And this would be the perfect place to do it
>One thing is for sure though
>Tonight is gonna be a good night

Chapter 7 : Lost In The Mood

>The world is a quiet blur as you sit next to Calamity, ignoring the odd stares you both receive
>The majority of Handlers don't go over to the bistro district, they could get any food they want from the Kiosks, provided they had the rank necessary
>However, you wanted a bit of atmosphere for tonight's dinner
>Maybe a quiet corner of a dimly lit restaurant, with a few synthetic candles and some good food
>And a good table cloth
>The base zooms by as you hold Calamity's paw, smiling at the occasional growl from her to anyone on the Transport
>Sure, most people looked at her like she was a violent monster, but in truth, she had never hurt anyone without a just cause
>A Donner that went rogue and attacked her handler, some skavs trying to jump you for your good food, or just a Handler who didn't like how Calamity didn't give him "respect"
>Never unprovoked though
>But you suppose seeing an over 7-foot tall murder machine growling at you would make you uncomfortable, that is if you weren't used to it
>In truth, you found yourself more at ease with Donners than humans
>And of humans, you were much more at ease with clones than normal humans
>That might be because you were trained solely around clones, and didn't see normal humans until you were fully grown
>And, your "first encounter" wasn't exactly great either
>They called you a "Skinjob", which was an insult for clones 
>Yet while you were here in the base, the Normal humans didn't go out of their way and fight for that was "their Planet"; instead they sat back, happy to let you and your wonderful Donner fight for them
>They lived a life of safety, in an underground base that had everything they could ever want
>But the Humans who came from the Surface; well that was a different story
>You had only been on protection duty once for new arrivals, as Calamity was usually too scary for newer humans to the base, especially those who had never seen a Donner
>But this group was used to Donners and because a mission got extended, the guard detail was short, so you were asked to help
>That look painted on their faces when they first entered the base and saw the atrium for the first time, that look of awe and happiness, it was seared into your head
>Nothing like the looks you're getting now
>People frowning at you and Calamity, like you were both a time bomb waiting to go off
>Still, you wouldn't have to deal with those looks for long, because your stop was coming up thankfully
>You stand and motion for Calamity to follow suit, which she does with a small smile
>As the stop approaches, you reach into your pocket and pull out Calamity's collar
>Not her view collar, but her basic leather one
>Her eyes go wide as you reach up and buckle it in place around her neck
>"H-here sir? Someone might s-" 
>You raise a hand to silence her
>"What are they gonna do about it?" you say with a confident smile as you extend a hand to her
>She smiles and grasps it firmly
>"Nothing sir"
>You peer around the transport at the humans on board, and see a few giving you concerned or confused looks, like they saw you put the collar on Calamity but didn't quite understand
>Only one gives you a quaint smirk, like he knew and approved
>That makes you chuckle a bit as the transport lurches to a halt, making Calamity shuffle into you a bit
>Still that charade? You knew she could keep her balance, but was simply using it as an excuse to get closer to you, but then again you don't mind
>You take her paw into your hand and lead her through the bistro district, savoring the smells in the air
>So different, so exotic 
>Sure you don't have the same sense of smell Calamity has, but here you can pick out the individual places
>Old school Mexican before the Great War, Italian, French, Japanese
>All so enticing
>You look around, still gripping Calamity's paw in your hand firmly
>The tastes would all be exquisite. So maybe you should opt for atmosphere to sway your choice?
>After all, punishments should be kept private, and that's why you're here 
>Looking around, you pick relatively new restaurant that had only a few customers
>"Giovanni's" the sign said, not even in the usual neon, just a basic printed sign
>Opened by people from the surface, trying hard to preserve what little heritage they could
>Not that it mattered to you, food was food, and customs for a particular "lineage" was stupid
>Why do the "Japanese" descendants care that you stick your little chopsticks into the rice? Why would the "Italians" care if you wanted the pasta broken up beforehand?
>Even more confusing was the Japanese custom of leaving food behind on a plate for an "unexpected visitor" and the Chinese custom of finishing everything no matter what
>Or had you switched those around? 
>Whatever, you don't care, those things were useless anyway
>You just wanted to eat and those idiosyncrasies seemed worthless to you
>And so, you lead you Donner into the dimly lit restaurant with a slight smile on your face
>You're greeted by a very anxious looking human, a teenage female from the looks of it
>She looks from you to Calamity, like you were going to shoot her in the face, or Calamity would bite her face off
>"W-w-welcome to Giovanni's! W-what can I do for you tonight?" she stutters, causing an eye roll from Calamity
>"Just a secluded table for us, we don't want to be disturbed much" you say with a calm smile
>"We don't get the chance to get out much because of...US. So please, if you could, we just want to have a pleasant night out, so whatever the most secluded place you have to seat us would be perfect" 
>90% of that statement was true. You and Calamity never got a chance to go out, Or maybe it was just between missions, swapping patrols with A.lfa to get a night alone, and the rare slow evenings together
>Regardless, the hostess, who looked much more relieved, leads you to a quiet forsaken corner of the restaurant
>Quiet piano and violins sound off in the background as you walk through the darkened coves of this place
>Dim candles are the only illumination here, setting a nice quiet tone for the night
>How could you not admire the flickering of the candlelight against Calamity's stunning fur? The colors, the contrast and her brilliant fiery eyes
>All of it added up to being mesmerizing for you
>You pull out Calamity's chair for her and she sits, flicking her tail to the side to brush against you before you walk away to your seat
>The table has several candles in the center and is draped with a long white table cloth
>"Perfect" you think to yourself as you sit down across from Calamity, the firelight dancing in her orange eyes
>Menus are set in front of you and Calamity, basic paper things with meals you would love, but were a secondary concern on tonight's excursion
>A quick peek at the menu reveals several things you would enjoy, plus a ton of things you know Calamity would love
>You look over the paper menu at her and see her eyes widen,  the prices standing out to her before the meals themselves
>Prices were a bit of an issue, going out today would set back some of the "enhancements" you had in mind for Calamity, but with everything that had gone on recently; getting a new roommate, Jane reappearing and you getting injured by Calamity
>Both of you needed a treat, and she needed a bit more than that
>"Order anything you want" you say as you look at her
>Her eyes flick up to you. Revealing the fiery orange warmth around her pupils
>"Are you sure sir? This is all so expensive" she says, looking from you to the menu
>You smile calmly "It’s all fine" you say, completely disregarding the costs
>Your "mining" would offset the costs regardless, and both of you needed a night like this
>A tiny human waitress approaches, speaking in hushed tones and not making eye contact with you or Calamity, like either of you would begin shooting lasers out of your eyes to melt her
>"What can I get you both to drink?" she says, her eyes boring into the notepad she had in her hands
>"I think I’ll try the Chardonnay and a glass of water please" you say confidently, staring at the wine menu like you knew what it all meant
>Certain wines go with certain cheeses that go with certain whatever? Too much to keep track of honestly. 
>You just wanted a drink and to not look like an idiot
>"I'll have the Sloppy Drop! I'm surprised you have it here! Gimme a pitcher of it!" Calamity chimes in after you order
>"Sloppy drop" is a drink that's made for Donners, like the wine coolers of the old world, made to be more sweet and flavorful rather than alcoholic
>"Ok! I'll be right back" the waitress says happily before scurrying off
>You smile at Calamity, who is currently looking around the restaurant, admiring the scenery
>"I think it's time for punishment for my side, bad girl" you say with a smile, looking at the Large Donner
>She freezes, even if just for a moment, but it was enough to tell you that calling her "bad girl" had an effect
>"What should I do sir?" she says, her orange eyes meeting yours, looking both questioning and seductive
>A quiet point below the table from you, and an understanding nod from her, is all that is needed as the large Donner slides out of her chair with more grace than you thought possible for someone her size
>In an instant, she's disappeared below the table, all of her actions now obscured by the thick tablecloth
>"Punishment" was something of a misnomer you suppose, because now you were at her will at this point
>she could spend the next hour teasing you with her long tongue if she wanted
>but as you feel your pants get pulled off with vigor, something tells you that wouldn't be that case
>You keep a straight face, focus on the feeling of her paws reaching into your undergarments and pulling out your erection
>Breathe deep, focus on the feeling and keep a straight face, that's all you had to do
>A long wet tongue licks up and down, leaving your shaft slippery and wet
>Soft padded paws wrap around your member and rub it softly as you sit and look over the menu
>What pairs with wine? You honestly don't know, you just ordered the wine to seem sophisticated
>Fuck it, just go with what tastes good
>A soft lick to the head of your cock sends shivers down your spine
>Calamity knows every place she could lick, nibble or tease to get reactions from you, even if you tried your best to keep a stoic face, it would be broken by her gentle teasing
>Her long tongue wraps around your member, and slurps up and down your length, careful not to make a sound as she licks
>You gasp as you feel her take your entire cock into her mouth, the warm wetness enveloping you without warning
>"Sir? Are you ok?" come a voice besides you, causing you to jump slightly
>The waitress stands beside you, carrying a tray with bottle of wine, a wine glass, a cup of water and a large pitcher of Sloppy drop and an empty cup
>"Uh yes, I'm fine" you say, trying to keep a stone face as Calamity attacks you relentlessly with her mouth
>She looks at you for a moment, then notices the empty seat across from you
>"Where is your uh...Companion?" she asks as she begins setting the drinks down on the table
>"She's uh... Freshening up" you say grabbing the bottle of wine much more violently than intended, as Calamity pulls your entire length into her throat
>The heat of her mouth, as well as the constant suckling feeling from her as she strokes you with her tongue, is indescribable
>A constant feeling of ecstasy that keeps you struggling to keep a straight face
>"Oh, uh...ok, I'll be back in a bit to take your orders then" the waitress days before walking away with a confused look
>Calamity continues her intense licking and sucking, taking no breaks to stop
>She didn't need to breathe after all, so she could continue the onslaught of her punishment without hindrance
>You reach one hand under the table to guide her, only to have it pushed away and the warmth leave your member exposed to the cold and dripping with saliva
>"No sir, let me take care of you the best way I can" comes Calamity's sultry voice from under the table
>You hear an odd shuffling from under the table, then feel her tail wrap around your waist
>"I think I got you all lubed up for here"
>You feel a warm paw grasp your cock gently and guide it into a very tight opening
>A slight moan, wet sliding into Calamity and the feeling of her ass pressed against you
>"Calamity? I-is that?" you gasp as you feel warm walls tighten around your member 
>"Bad girls don't g-get to be Bred sir, but I wanted to feel you in me" She says before pushing all the way against you
>Her insides are tight and radiate warmth into you
>You can feel her tightening her muscles around you as she begins slowly pumping against you
>Slight moans can be heard from under the table cloth as she slowly speeds up, her tail wrapped around you
>It takes everything in you to try to keep a straight face as your fingers try to dig into the table to get a grip, your legs lock around the table legs to keep from being pushed backwards
>The amount of restraint you keep to not simply put your hands under the table and grab her plump ass was unbelievable as she speeds up, pushing you further into her yearning ass
>"Mmmm, feels good sir" she moans quietly, just barely audible above the music playing
>She hilts you and begins a slow grinding motion, savoring your stiff erection in her ass as you quietly gasp from the sensation
>However the sound of footsteps brings you out of your blissful state, and make you attempt to sit up straight
>Calamity has other plans though and pushes hard against you, forcing you to keep your feet hooked around the table’s legs
>"Oh, your friend isn't back yet? Do you know what she wanted?" the waitress says as she walks up, giving you a quizzical look
>You struggle to form any coherent sentences as Calamity gyrates her hips against you
>"I uh think -ah- she'll have the lamb chops" you struggle to say as you feel Calamity squeeze you a bit with her steel cable muscles
>"And I'll have the seafood Alfredo" you say with a wavering smile as you pour a glass of wine for yourself
>The waitress keeps giving you odd looks as you sip your wine
>"She's been gone a while, shall I check the res-" she begins
>"NO! Err -Ah- Uhmm no, she's fine, thank you" you say, nearly choking on your drink
>The waitress gives you a pitied look, like she expected Calamity just left you here, then walks away quietly
>"I thought she would never leave" drifts Calamity's quiet moans from under the table could as she resumes pounding her ass against you
>Renewed vigor and lust fuels her rhythmic pumping as she moves like an engine piston
>"S-sir Please, I'm so c-close! Fill me up" she quietly whines
>As she whimpers softly, her walls clamp down and pulsate with heat, bringing your limit ever closer
>"H-Here it comes Love" you groan quietly
>Her rhythm gets faster, along with a side to side grinding motion as she moans 
>Without warning, you feels her body shiver and shudder, sending spasms that tighten around your thick member, pushing you over the edge
>You unload into her and slump forwards against the table, panting hard
>"Ohh G-g-god, I came from my ass Sir" Calamity quietly moans
>She grinds a little more against you, your cock still inside her 
>"T-that was a good punishment" you gasp, putting a hand under the table to squeeze her plump ass
>"N-not done yet sir, this bad girl still needs more punishment" she moans "But that will have to wait until we get to the room" 
>Quietly, she slides you out of her Perfect ass, leaving you feeling a bit wanting, and you hear her re-adjusting her clothes
>You take the time to adjust your clothes as well, noting how cold your nethers felt without Calamity pressed against you
>Within moments, she's back up at the table, sitting pretty like nothing happened, although you notice she is panting slightly
>"I Love you sir" she whispers, her paws gliding across the table to meet your hands and interlock her pads with your fingers
>"I Love you too Calamity" you whisper back
>What a way to set the mood for an evening meal.
>The food you ordered soon arrives, allowing you and Calamity to enjoy a wonderful meal together
>Despite the punishment for Calamity (or was it a punishment for you?), the ambiance and setting is amazing and a welcome change of scenery
>Usually you ate in your room, or some out of the way location where prying eyes wouldn't disturb you
>Behind the service docks, in the briefing room after the days missions had gone out
>Anywhere you could be alone with Calamity
>Calamity, drinks deep of her Sloppy Drop, a happy smile on her face as she eats her meal
>You drank your wine, disregarding the taste for the sake of alcohol
>The bottle was yours at this point, so why not drink as much as you could?
>The food itself is wonderful, a stark contrast to the food synthesized by the kiosks
>It wasn't better per se, rather just different, like the difference between bottles of coke vs a can of coke
>Both had their merits and both had drawbacks
>Calamity orders a growler of the Sloppy drop to go, as you both finish your meals and then head back to your room
>It's late, so the usual crowds have dispersed
>How long had you been out? Working with Joe to empty Jane of sand took a while, coupled with your excursion for food
>It was later than you intended, that's for certain
>But empty transports were always welcome
>When you arrive to the Handler/ Donner dorms, only a few stragglers are there
>As you walk through the common area, you see a few groups that make you smile at the sight of them
>Senior handlers, and a few private handlers, snuggled together with their Donners, trying to stretch the time they have together
>While it’s sad that they couldn't send the night together, it was encouraging at the same time
>They had that bond, that thought process that Donners weren't a thing but were living beings 
>This was the next group of handlers, trying their hardest to cement that unspeakable bond between their Donners
>Yes, relationships between handlers and Donners were commonplace, but it wasn't talked about really
>How could it be? Perfectly made humans, bred to be the best, choosing robotics over "real humans"?
>So taboo. Or something like that; not that you cared
>Yet here, where it was just handlers and Donners, it was the norm
>A few eyes look at you as you walk past, including an oddly familiar lioness Donner and her handler, as well as Echo and Calypso
>You nod at Echo as you walk by, earning a look of confusion
>How do you make up for your unnecessary backlash? The feelings you had felt from the previous day had leaked through and unleashed itself onto him
>Your angry emotions, while usually kept in check, leaked through
>And so, he bore the brunt of your anger
>You give him a sad smile, then continue onward
>The door to the Chief handler’s dwellings is like putty, the security melting away before you and Calamity, who grips you happily with a clawed paw, not wanting to leave physical contact, as well as holding her growler of sloppy drop
>You would judge her but you too were a bit inebriated, having drank the entire bottle of overpriced wine
>Together, snuggling into each other as you walk to your room, you feel closer to her in every way
>Sure, drinking together wasn't the "Final test" of a relationship, but in this case it was a good judge
>A skill you had learned being a handler was to be somewhat considerate to others
>You had shared rooms your whole life, living in bays of hundreds with no privacy had taught you that you should be quiet at night
>As quietly as you could, you open the door to your shared bedroom, trying your absolute hardest to make as little noise as possible
>Success, the door opens without so much as a creak
>You drape an arm around Calamity, and lead her in quietly
>However, you're met with a small surprise
>Joe sits in his bed, brushing Jane's fur, even though she was out cold
>"Joe?" you ask simply
>He brings a finger to his lips
>"Shush, she's sleeping, oddly enough"
>You nod quietly and continue to your side of the room
>Jane rarely "Slept", too risky she always said
>If she was able to trust Joe with her sleeping, than you and Calamity could as well
>You undress and watch as Calamity does as well
>The thought of further punishment forgotten, Calamity snuggles up to you as you lay in your bed
>Today had been amazing, sure you had to teach a new guy stuff, but you got to spend time with Calamity and Jane
>But tomorrow was a new day, probably filled with teaching Joe new things
>For now though, you're just happy to be here with your Donner

Chapter 8: We Are Your Friends

>It’s been a few months since Joe and Jane disrupted your usual routine with Calamity, A.lfa and Volfa.
>Usually you had been on alternating schedules with them; you go one patrol one day, leaving him and Volfa to their activities; then they go on patrol, leaving you and Calamity to your... misdeeds.
>Now you and Calamity were starved for alone time, with almost every second of every day sent with Jane and Joe.
>Of course you enjoyed this human interaction; before it had been just you and Calamity, and while you loved each other, it was good to have something new thrown into the mix.
>As such you and Calamity found new ways to spend time with each other.
>One of your workouts now involved you swimming laps, while Calamity waded through the pool alongside you slowly; maintenance involved more slow methodical work that included gentle kisses.
>All the while, as you trained and taught Joe; you never really learned anything about him beyond he grew up on the surface and could make a mean cup of coffee.
>Right now, as the two of you work in a tandem simulation, you sip a cup of coffee brewed by him.
>These kinds of ops were... unconventional.
>Before Joe had arrived, you never worked with another handler in simulations.
>"Calamity's starting on the ground floor, can you and Jane take the top?" you call to him calmly as Calamity enters a building.
>"Yea. Jane grapple to the roof and start working downwards, we need to find this target" Joe says besides you, looking at the screens of his stations.
>Oddly, the two of you work extremely well together; especially when your stations are right next to each other.
>You can see what Jane sees, and can coordinate what Calamity does; and he can do the same with Jane.
>How he has such good intuition is beyond you, but they must have brought him in for a reason.
>You switch to thermal vision as Calamity clears the various rooms.
>"I’m not getting any hits from the bottom floors, what can you see from the top?"
>Joe's view swaps as well, as he scans his screens
>"I got nothing, are we in the wrong buildin-"
>"I see something! Movement the next building over" Calls out Calamity, focusing on the building next to the one she and Jane are in.
>Joe looks at your screens and sees what Calamity is looking at, then directs Jane.
>"240, about 5 stories up, show me what’s hiding there please"
>So polite directing Jane; like he isn’t quite sure what he’s doing yet, even though you had been with him during these Tagalog sims for weeks.
>"Alpha, we have multiple targets in the next building overs, can you confirm?"  His voice calls through the radio.
>On missions he had the odd habit to call you Alpha, even though you told him not too.
>Another mystery that was Joe the random Human...
>That doesn’t matter now.
>You focus on one of your side screens and swap to thermal vision once more.
>"I see them, same attack pattern as always? You go high, I go low?" you call out as Calamity rushes out of the building.
>"I think we can force them too you or just knock down the whole building; use Calamity's linear fusion rifle to shot out the bottoms supports, and I'll have Jane shoot downwards with her Vulcan rifle" Joe says over the comms
>Hmmm, it might work; Calamity couldn’t bring down a building on her own, but the combined effects of her making the building shudder and shake, plus Jane’s destruction from above.... It might work.
>"OK give me a count down once Calamity is in position" you say calmly to him.
>"Move out, head to the designated building and head to the basement" you say sternly
>"Yes sir" she says obediently
>As Calamity marches to the next building, she keys into the private voice channel with  just you; Joe, the spectators, Omega, no one else could hear this chat.
>"Can we trust Joe? He hasn't been around long and I don't wanna get killed, even if it is just a sim" she says worriedly as she moves into the ground floor swiftly.
>"If it’s a fuck up, it’s on him" You say calmly through the voice channel "But I think he's right in this case Love; if I thought otherwise I wouldn't have you follow his directions ok?" you say reassuringly
>Calamity whimpers softly 
>"Ok Sir" She says softly
>"Good girl" is you response
>Back into the voice channel with Joe and everyone else
>"Calamity is in position" You call out.
>"Alright, Donner's on my mark" he commands "Begin firing in 3...2...1"
>As Calamity charges up and fires her rifle at each support beam, you hear Jane's Vulcan cannon raining death from above.
>The building starts teetering as each beam is taken out in rapid succession
>Jet fuel might not melt steel beams, but 2 Donners could.
>"Ok Calamity get of there before the building collapses onto you" you remark as you note parts of the ceiling beginning to fall around her.
>You hear Joe instruct Jane with a similar command.
>"Jane, Grapple to the next building and get off that roof"
>Calamity runs out of the building as it crumbles into a heap
>"Jane! Jane grab th-!" You look over and to your horror see that Jane wasn't able to grapple away
>She’s free falling about 200 feet, and a fall from that height would do serious damage to her frame.
>"Calamity, 100 degrees, Full Speed! Catch Jane!" You Command loudly
>No hesitation, Calamity turns in the direction you told her and takes off faster than any Human could.
>You stare at the screen unable to do anything else as Jane plummets
>Come on!
>"Joe... I’m sorry...” Jane says sadly as she falls "I love y-OOF"
>She’s interrupted by Calamity tackling her out of the air, dissipating her downwards momentum, but also causing Calamity huge frame land on top of her.
>Your camera feed shows a close-up of Jane's annoyed and pained face.
>"OW SIS! GETOFFA ME!" Jane yells, trying in vain to push Calamity off her.
>Calamity gets off her as the building collapses behind them.
>Reminds you of a song from the old days where a guy asked where his mind was.
>Jane sits up and rubs her back in annoyance.
>"Geez Sis, did ya have to tackle me so hard?" 
>You can tell from Calamity's voice that she afraid of losing her sister as she says 2 simple words.
>"You're welcome"
>With that Jane freezes for a moment, then stands up and hugs Calamity softly.
>"Thanks sis"
>Calamity returns the hug
>"If anyone gets to kill you it’s me, so don't go dying" She says mockingly "Also it’s a sim, you aren’t gonna die for real here so no need to go all mushy" 
>Jane's eyes go wide in confusion and then she looks down, kicking a bit of sand 
>”Sis...I’m not used to Sims...I forgot…"she says, folding her ears down in embarrassment  
>As touching a moment as this was, there was a mission to finish
>"Ladies, we can talk more when we get done, we need to confirm your kills and ensure the target was eliminated" you say sternly, yet with a small smile.
>"Right! Sorry Sir!" Calamity says as bolts upright and looks to the rubble.
>"I've got heat signatures, to the north side of the rubble" Joe says calmly.
>"Jane keep lookout for any attackers, Calamity, start vaporizing rocks and clearing rubble" you direct
>"OK!"
>"Yes Sir"
>The varied responses make you smile a bit, with how similar those two may be, they are also so so different.
>Jane diligently keep watch as Calamity gets through the rubble towards the fading heat source.
>"Kills confirmed...also it looks like... they might have had a weird device on them..." Calamity says looking at the mangled bodies and an odd machine.
>You recognize it nearly instantly.
>"That, is a localized EMP, big enough to fry anything within 50 yards" you say with a frown.
>The only reason you knew is because you had taken extra training about protecting your Donner on missions.
>Joe looks at you shocked.
>"You mean, it would ha-"
>"Yes, it would have shut down their electronics, not fatally, but for long enough to allow for the target to escape or to kill them" you say, studying the device through your monitors.
>"Either way, kill confirmed, Simulations complete" you say with a cold smile on your face, again they tried to throw a curve-ball at you only for you to come out on top.
>Well, mostly you, Joe is the one who suggested bringing down the building...And for some reason,although his ideas were a bit unconventional, usually worked.
>It was...Odd; to say the least.
>But that wasn’t something you were going to let bother you as you stride out of the simulation chamber to meet Calamity in a big hug.
>Sure it was just a sim, but it was one where you both come out unscathed.
>Out of the corner of your eye, you see Joe give Jane a somewhat awkward hug, like he still wasn’t sure it was ok.
>Hm. Interesting
>"Alright you four, enough, we got places to be." come a slightly annoyed, gravelly voice.
>You know that voice, you turn and see Dima, an older handler along with his Donner Grimm; a Lynx Donner known for her tracking and the heavy magnum held in her leg.
>Instinctively, you stand up straight.
>"Sir ye-" you begin remembering formalities.
>"Oi, fuck off with all that" He says, cutting off your formal greeting.
>"Comeon we got places to be" he berates you with a wave over his shoulder as he turns away and begins walking down the long sterile hallway.
>You're stunned for a moment, both at his calm attitude, but also at how he seems to disregard rank.
>Dima is a Specialty Handler; one outside the norms. Normal handlers, regardless of rank have certain duties to perform.
>The specialties, they are akin to the Special Forces of old; rank means nothing and skill means everything.
>"Hurry up" he calls back to you, freeing you from your frozen state.
>You rush after him, through the twisting turns of the underground base, to a room you’ve never been before.
>He opens the door for you and gives a suspiciously friendly gesture along with the words "After you"
>You and Joe enter to darkness, then a blinding spotlight in your faces.
>Jane and Calamity act quickly. 
>Calamity instantly wraps herself around you, putting herself between you and the like, while Jane pushes Joe towards the door for an escape route.
>"Ah... That's what we like to see" comes a familiar voice as the spot light dies down; revealing Omega and a group of older handlers you had met before.
>"Donners protecting their handlers no matter what, you picked a good one this time Omega" Comes a wizened voice from one of the handlers.
>"Alpha...I'm sure you have questions, but let us explain first" say Omega with that stupid grin you had come to hate.
>Why is he using your formal name?
>"We have all been watching you; your control over your Donner, your skill for direction in battle, and your general abilities" comes another voice from the crowd.
>Screens and projections of your various missions spring forth.
>The shot at a sniper nest, you spotting the trip mine and various other things you had done with Calamity appears above their heads.
>"And You, Joe; you are a wild card paired perfectly with Alpha" comes another voice.
>The video shifts to the two of you working together, one is of you dumping sand out of Jane, another is of him helping you work on Calamity's rifle.
>Calm smiles between the two of you are visible.
>You don't dislike Joe, sure he isn't quite what you would call a friend, but he is someone you know you can trust.
>After all he is the man who finally wrangled Jane.
>"Alpha; we have had our eye on you for a very, very long time, far before Joe joined us" Says Omega, his grin someone...perplexing.
>It’s like he isn’t sure if he should be happy or angry.
>"your control over Calamity, while...unorthodox; is unparalleled" he says with a frown.
>He continues with an even bigger frown "You have smashed almost every record we had for the Sims; have a high confirmed kill count; yet are not a chief yet" Omega says plainly
>What is this a recollection of your past? You don’t need a play by play of your life.
>"We have actually held off on promoting you because we needed to be sure that you are the right choice" he says with a defeated huff.
>Dima looks at you with a smirk, while a different Specialty handler stands.
>Graves, a Handler you’ve known about and met only a few times looks through his notes.
>He's about 5'8 and is thinner than most, which complements his Donner, Wreckage.
>People were intimidated by Calamity for her sheer size, but she couldn’t hold a candle to Wreckage.
>Standing at near 10 feet tall, she is a Grizzly Bear Donner; although she isn’t in the room right now.
>Graves and Wreckage were usually only sent out for sheer demolition missions; destroy a building, down a radio tower.
>What had taken Calamity and Jane working together to bring down a building, Wreckage could with ease.
>Graves clears his throat and looks at you.
>"Alpha, while you do have some anger issues; we see that you are effective in most kinds of ops, either directing Calamity to take point or to be support" he says with an oddly monotone voice, reading from the notes directly.
>A video of you twisting that one handler arm back after Calamity teased them with food is shown, then you yelling at Echo for his stupidness and refusal to take patrols seriously.
>Graves shuffles through the notecards with a frown before tossing them over his shoulder.
>"Look, the point is, despite your flaws, you are a great handler and make things work even when you lash out" he says in a much more friendly voice now that he isn’t reading from notecards.
>"Just work on the anger, not everything is going to go perfect, try not to let it bother you" he says with a grin before sitting down.
>You nod at him, then Omega speaks without bothering to stand up.
>"And now to you, Joe, the Human from the surface; your ancestry has made you a formidable handler, the instant of a cloned handler plus the surface ingenuity" he says with his grey eyes focused on Joe.
>Ancestry? What do they mean?
>You turn to look to Joe; who keeps staring straight ahead at them older handlers.
>Another question about him huh? You’ll add it to the pile.
>"You and Jane have proven effective, and since you know of the plans in place, you are the perfect candidate for this operation" Omega finishes.
>"Alpha, as of now, you and Calamity are being cross-trained into the Specialty ranks along with Joe and Jane; as well part of the Phoenix project" Grimm says with a slight smirk.
>"Before you ask, yes, you gain your own quarters, but with a small twist; You and Calamity must share a common living space with Joe and Jane, but you will have your own bedrooms"
>The lynx donner Grimm, who was in the shadows leans over to Calamity.
>"Ooo your own room, maybe now you don’t have to hide that leash" she smugly whispers, just barely loud enough for you to hear.
>Calamity's ears fold down and her usual angry face is replaced by one of embarrassment.
>how do they know abou-; no, it doesn’t matter.
>You focus once more on the group of handlers before you.
>"You and Joe will be performing co-op missions, as we test the effectiveness of teams of handlers working together for missions" Omega says, looking down on you and Joe with a bored expression.
>Your own room? Specialty rank? Ancestry? THEY KNOW!?
>What kind of weird timeline is this?
>"Any questions?" Omega says looking over his notes.
>Your mind flashes to Jane's classified chest plates from when you were working on her.
>"Does this have to do with Jane's closed chest?" you ask calmly, studying their reactions.
>Graves smiles knowingly, Omega frowns and Dima is looking at his Holophone.
>"Yep" Dima says dismissively, still flicking through whatever is on his Holophone.
>You wait for further explanation, only to not get anything thing else.
>"You all are dismissed, you will receive more info in 2 days, tomorrow you will gather your personal belongings from your room, and move to the specialty quarters" Omega says, looking from you to Joe with a bemused expression.
>"Yes sir" you say calmly
>"Alright" says Joe at the same time.
>"Hm, even the differences in how you both think is evident in how you talk, but maybe that’s why you both work well together" Dima says with a bored grin, still not looking at you both.
>Omega leans forwards, looking at you both with a mix of disdain and intrigue.
>"Alpha, I suggest you take Joe through the history museum, maybe you can teach him a bit about donners to help him"
>You nod silently then turn to leave; you feel Calamity's paw grasp yours tight as you walk out, followed by Joe and Jane
>The four of you walk for a bit before you hear the footsteps behind you stop.
>Coming to a stop yourself, you look back and see Joe looking at Jane with concern, one hand grasping her paw tight; the other with a pointer finger under her chin.
>"A.non...Alpha...What have we gotten ourselves into really?" he says with a frown, looking at you.
>He has the gall to ask you that? What about his ancestry? HOW he tamed Jane? What was in Jane's chest?
>You feel your anger flair before logic sets in.
>If he is asking you, he must not know himself; at least not know all of it.
>Project Phoenix is a mystery to the both of you; and while he might know is a few things you didn't, you knew leagues more about Donners.
>With one hand holding Calamity's paw tight, you use the other to push your hair back in annoyance.
>It’s not even that your hair was long, it was just a...thing you did, no real reason why.
>You sigh and squeeze Calamity's paw softly before you answer.
>"Just A.non Joe, I don't know what going on; but we are partners in this. Who you were before doesn't matter, I’m counting on you to help me keep Calamity safe, just like I hope you count on me to keep Jane safe" you say extending a hand to him with a smile.
>He looks from your hand to your face, like he is deciding if he is taking you seriously.
>your smile fades as he looks back and forth.
>Without warning he grabs your hand harder than you expected.
>"Yea alph- I mean A.non, let's protect our Donners together!" he says with an expectant smile.
>Matching his fevered handshake, you look him in the eyes.
>"Alright Joe, you have learned how to care for Donners but for now lets head to our room" you say, pulling Calamity towards you sharply so you can wrap an arm around her waist.
>Joe does the same, pulling Jane to him with a smile.
>"Lead on A.non" he says with a smile.
>Jane giggles while Calamity looks somewhat flustered at you showing this kind of dominance in public.
>She should get used to it, after all it sound like you were all stuck together for a LONG time.
>A feeling within you pops up as you lead everyone to the transport.
>What is it?
>words can’t quite explain.
>A feeling of connection to someone other than Calamity, and someone other than Jane.
>Through your training, you kept everyone at arm’s reach, if they died of failed they wouldn't affect you.
>Jane was different though, and now so was Joe.
>The both of you were stuck together, but you didn't dislike it.
>It was the man who tamed the wild Jane paired with the man who calmed the bad egg Calamity.
>and yet you were both out on top.
>"Come on, I've got a lot to teach you Joe" you say with a smile, motioning over your shoulder down the hallway.
>Joe smiles and nods at you with confidence.
>You set off down the hallway, noting the difference in Calamity
>Normally while in the company of others, she growls and pushed everyone away from you, but now she was acting totally different.
>She has her arms wrapped around your arm and nuzzles you gently as you lead Joe and Jane.
>"Calamity?" you say questioningly to her, loud enough for just her to hear.
>"I can trust my sister to keep our secrets...and whoever she chose" she says, nuzzling against you.
>Hm. if she can trust him, you can; but you still hold some reservations.
>He was still someone you don’t understand.
>But still someone you can trust.
You walk out of the squadron hallways into the main atrium to the food kiosks.
>It has been a long day, you're tired and hungry.
>"We have a long day tomorrow Joe, Packing, and I have to teach you about... Us" you say calmly, pushing your hand to the kiosk screen for food.
>"Sir? can we have pizza tonight? I LOVE pizza" Calamity says expectantly.
>Pizza it is then...as long as it didn’t have pineapple, you were happy.
>after a few seconds, the machine coughs out a large pizza for you and Calamity.
>Moving aside, you watch as Joe inputs a recon quest for something called "Meatloaf"
>What appears is... well it looks like something that Calamity would make trying to cook for you.
>And that's not an insult to Calamity.
>It’s a literal rectangle of browned meat, looking like a brown log of wood with ketchup on top.
>You frown at his selection, but keep quiet; leading your group to the waiting transport.
>"Come on, all aboard" you say with a calm smile.
>When everyone gets on, you push a few buttons on the transport and it jets off without another sound.
>Sims usually run late into the night because they are like real missions, there are no jumps in time or waiting.
>Because of that most of the time when Sims ended, it was late at night and you all had the transport to yourselves again.
>Thoughts flash to the last time you had a solo ride with Calamity, her nude and crawling to you like the good girl she is. Now though; it’s you, Calamity, Jane and Joe, all waiting to get somewhere.
>While it is annoying that Joe and Jane's training interrupted your alone time with Calamity; there was plenty of time where they were gone for solo Sims, leaving you and Calamity alone for whatever.
>For now though. It was time for everyone to sleep, you and Joe had been tested more than ever before.
>Never before had you had so many Sims in a row, with each one building up higher and higher in terms of difficultly.
>However you and Joe overcame each one, either by your sheer knowledge or his odd problem solving.
>But that doesn't stop the sheer tiredness of it all
>You yawn ,much to your own annoyance; it was too early to sleep, and you had so much you wanted to do and had no room being tired.
>But as you arrive to the common areas for the handlers, you know you wouldn't be able to stay awake for long.
>How could you? maybe it's because you have been running near constant Sims, repairs, and training since Joe had arrived.
>As the transport stops, you're gently jerked back into the waking world by it making you lurch to one side.
>You nearly collapse onto Calamity, who shakes her head, blinking out the white noise from her eyes.
>This has taken a toll on you all.
>You're reminded of that when you look over at Jane and Joe, both snuggled together and snoring slightly.
>You were used to these hours and were made to survive without sleep, but they weren't.
>Joe was a surface dweller and Jane rarely slept.
>You and Calamity were somewhat used to this, and to see even Jane passed out from lack of sleep was something else.
>The odd hours, the patrols, having to stay up until 2 am.
>It would beat anyone down.
>What to do now though?
>Do you wake them and guide them to the room?
>No.... Not like this.
>"Love, can you carry Joe? I’ll get Jane" you say sleepily, letting the time get the better of you
>Yea, you’re used to it, but that doesn’t make it easier.
>Calamity doesn’t say anything, but picks up Joe gently and carries him out of the transport.
>You in turn pick up Jane, and carry her delicately out of the transport, following Calamity softly.
>The food is forgotten as you carry the pair out of the transport, someone would have a great meal.
>The common areas are almost empty as you move through them.
>There are a few stragglers, handler and Donners left over from the day, but they don’t bother you.
>it’s almost odd how the other handlers and Donners understand.
>almost every other handler has been in a position like this, where they spent all day in sims, all day working hard; only to fall asleep on their Donners shoulder when they finally got the chance to go home.
>Seeing a Ddonner carry a handler to bed, or even seeing random donners and handlers, carrying others donners or handlers to their respective rooms was... common to say the least.
>You had carried quite a few private handlers on your back to their quarters in your time around, just like Calamity had carried so many Smaller Donners back to their beds.
>Was it by plan? Force the younger generation of handlers and donners seek help, that it builds a bridge of understanding?
>But right now... With Joe and Jane...Does it matter?
>They were with you through this new thing. Through project phoenix; Whatever that was.
>And more to the point...They are your friends you decided.
>Was Joe trustworthy? Can you trust Jane's decision making? 
>If you trust them both, will it help you keep Calamity alive?
>Maybe.
>But you trust Jane, and she trusted Joe; so that was enough for you.
>As you carry Jane to your shared bedroom, and let Calamity and Joe in first.
>Manners still matter.
>You watch as Calamity gently lays Joe on the bed, and note how a something hits the floor.
>What is that? 
>Whatever, you gently lay Jane down next to Joe on their bed and watch as she snuggles against him.
>Calamity picks up the dropped something, and looks at it in confusion before handing it to you.
>"What is this sir?" she says sleepily
>You take it calmly and turn it over in your hands a few times.
>A knife, a folded knife that is weathered and beaten but still a knife.
>for some reason it looks familiar, but you're sure you've never seen it before.
>If Joe carried this on him it must be important....
>You don’t bother extending the blade.
>Silently, you pull open the drawer on Joe's bedside table that put the knife away.
>He already had so many odd things, a weird knife on top of it all? Not a surprise.
>A question for another time.
>Joe and Jane snuggle up to each other as you push through the curtain separating the shared bedroom.
>Calamity has already stripped to nothing but striped panties and is beckoning you to bed.
>Who are you to refuse the call from your lover?
>You quickly get out of your uniform and then slip into bed next to Calamity, who wraps her strong arms around you.
>"We did it sir, we got our privacy" She whispers, snuggling your head into her chest fluff.
>You wrap your arms around her and sign contently.
>"We did it Love" you echo her, savoring the feeling of her fur.
>This is what you both had wanted for so long, to be able to do what you want without prying eyes.
>What Project Phoenix was...you didn’t know, but you did know it gave you what you had wanted for so long. 
>So it couldn’t be a bad thing.
>Those thoughts don’t bother you now as you drift off to sleep with Calamity in your arms.
>it’s a new life for you and her, but in the end; it all came down to this.
>The shared snuggle of two lovers.

Chapter 9: We Made It

>Packing things up for a move wasn't hard for you and Calamity.
>You had been planning to move for a while; so you had lived out of your various trunks and boxes.
>The tool chests have always been kept in perfect organization, the spare parts stored in trunks ready for easy movement.
>Joe and Jane were in the same boat, Jane Never really had much in terms of worldly possessions, Joe had just moved in.
>Because of that, everything was packed and ready to go in less than an hour.
>Omega, probably sensing that, had gotten a few vehicles redirected to help you and Joe.
>They were little more than a few "golf carts" of the old world but they were more than enough to carry everything you and Calamity owned.
>The goldfish rule applied here, and had since Donners and handlers had ever since the first had been introduced.
>You never expand further than you can grow.
>Because of this you never owned much, no room to store it.
>The move took less than 2 hours, everything you owned being transferred clear across the Ground Base to the new living arrangements you were to live in now.
>The "Specialty dorms"
>You didn't even know they were a thing until now.
>That probably spoke to the compartmentalized information Star-51 had.
>And you now had a "special" Specialty dorm with Joe and Jane.
>A few things strike you as odd though as you move to the new area; first, the population dwindles because this area of the groundbase is used for urban things like power stations and automated factories.
>Second, there aren't special guards or anything like that, just the usual security members guarding the outposts.
>Passing all of those lead to a nearly hidden area, literally a hole in one of the walls which opened up to a HUGE open area.
>Near blinding light pours in through skylights, a few Donners bask in the patches of sunlight, a large pool and weight lifting area sits apart for handlers to stay in shape.
>The Dorms are on the near opposite site of the groundbase you lived in, nearer to the surface, and with real windows to the outside world.
>It blows your mind that this was here without you knowing.
>You even see food kiosks ready to prepare meals for you and Calamity.
>Fuck...No wonder no one saw the specialties except on very Special assignments.
>The transports come to a stop near a very basic area that looks like it hasn't been used at all and you hop off it.
>Other specialty Donners and handlers are already there, having followed the transport.
>One of the older Handlers comes forwards with a thick mustached smile that reminded you of a grandfather.
>"Alpha and Joe? Plus Calamity and Jane? We heard about ya’ll,but didn't expect ya to be so young" the man says with an elderly gentleness.
>His words are, sharp, clear and concise, like what he said has weight behind it.
>"That's us" you say motioning to Calamity, Joe and Jane, as well as your stuff,
>"An oddball group for an oddball dorm, we'll all get along great, I'm Neil" he says with a twinkle in his eye and an extended hand.
>You grasp it with a smile
>"Call Me A.non, nice to meet you"
>Introductions are passed all around as Neil and his group help you and Joe into your new home.
>They mainly just help carry everything into your new living quarters.
>The dorms are... Different from what you're used to.
>A huge main room, with an attached kitchen with a full food kiosk and is connected to 2 bedrooms, both bigger than your old dorm, with bathrooms attached to them.
>It's more room than you had EVER had before.
>As you stand in your bedroom doorway, staring into the huge space; you're at a loss for words.
>What do you do with this much space? It was mind boggling.
>The room has a full Cali King sized bed, a dresser and a large closet.
>Calamity, sliding under your arm with more grace than you thought possible for a being her size, enters the room and spins around, arms outstretched in happiness.
>"SO much room for activities love! Look at it all"!
>You hear a similar sentiment from Jane and Joe, although quieter.
>Joe is from the surface. He must have lived in a shack with a corrugated tin roof with no power while Jane was...Jane, never really lived anywhere.
>...Well, probably.
>You have never been to the surface in person; you've only lived it through Calamity on patrols.
>What you saw was for the most part shabby, with badly put together houses of random scrap.
>That doesn't matter now as you and Calamity bring your tool boxes, computer and other belongings into your room, then walk back into the main living area.
>The main room is fully furnished with a couch, a plush chair, and a loveseat, all centered around a large holoscreen.
>It's more than you had dreamed of when you aimed for master handler; instead of getting just a bare room, you were given a full room plus a bedroom full of everything you had before.
>Joe has a look of wonder and confusion on his face as he stares around the room.
>"We have all this?" he asks, looking around as Jane carefully clicks options on the food kiosk in the kitchen.
>You sigh and look around, feeling somewhat at odds.
>You had always wanted to have a room to yourself, a space for you and Calamity, yet now that you had it...What do you do now?
>Before now it was just...Survive, get through the shitty parts to the point you were truly happy.
>But now that you had what you wanted...It's tough to reconcile your feelings with finally meeting your goal.
>You had heard that the problem with revenge is that you need to dig 2 graves; once it's complete, you have nothing left to live for.
>Why didn't they say that about goals?
>You achieved your goal, kinda, but now what?
>Having a space to live and be happy With Calamity, without fear of prying eyes was something you had always wanted.
>Now what though?
>Eh, now you go to the museum and figure it the long term later.
>With a last look around, you smile and gather yourself up, standing tall and stretching your body.
>"Yea this is all ours, but what are we hanging around for? Omega told me to show you the museum, so let's go" you say with a small sigh of relief as your joints pop silently.
>"Aww man! Nowww?" Jane pouts softly through a mouth full of food, looking at a half-eaten grilled cheese sandwich.
>Joe grabs the other half of the sandwich and stuffs it all into his mouth, looking deliberately at Jane with some of the food sticking out of his mouth.
>Jane laughs at him as he looks at her with what you can only assume is a silly face.
>Calamity joins you in the main room, walking in long strides from your bedroom.
>"Your bedroom"
>What an odd phrase....
>You wrap an arm around Calamity's waist and smile as Jane fights to contain her giggles.
>It's cute to watch them interact.
>"Awwww, just like us when we first got paired" Calamity cooes to you, loud enough for Jane to hear.
>Jane's ears fold, seemingly embarrassed and Joe just eats the sandwich, non-perplexed. 
>Maybe he didn't understand what Calamity had meant, maybe he didn't care.
>Doesn't matter as he finally swallows the food and grabs Jane's paw.
>You smile and with your arm still around Calamity's waist, guide her to the door.
>Calamity opens it, using her much longer reach to beat you to it.
>"Thank you love" you says with a smile, as you walk through the doorway, feeling actual sunlight.
>You have been on the surface before kind of, you've started patrols wishing Calamity good luck and wishing for safety, but you've never felt real sunlight.
>The mid-morning sun hits you through the windows and the warmth makes you freeze.
>The calm warmth flows across you and through you as Calamity drags you a few feet, only to look at you confused.
>Jane breaks the trance from the sunlight though with a solid kick to your ass.
>"Hey! Don’t get sidetracked by sunlight! If we're going to the museum then let’s go!" she says annoyingly as Calamity tries to help you regain yourself, while growling at Jane.
>Was this the difference?
>You spent your whole life in shade or in artificial light.
>Natural light...was it that much different? Enough to freeze you in its consuming warmth?
>You frown and push it aside in your mind, instead focusing on leaving the specialty area.
>Calamity helps you along, her firm grip on your waist.
>As you and your party reach the edge; that is where you were dropped off, you're left standing and confused.
>How do you reach the rest of the groundbase?
>Are you trapped here? Was this the prize of being a specialty handler?
>A slight "ahem" behind you attracts your attention.
>You turn around and see Neil with a knowing smile.
>He stands, before you pointing to a small podium about 5 meters away that looks like a post from a crosswalk of the old world.
>The only reason you know what those look like is because of Calamity.
>On the post is a single red button, almost glaring at you now that you notice it.
>Neil gives a hearty knowing laugh, then trots off to a group of Donners and handlers.
>How the tables have turned....
>You spent months teaching Joe, YEARS teaching other handlers; and here you are now lost like a child.
>Anger bubbles within you as you slam the side of your first into the button.
>How could they so readily throw you to the sharks? How could Omega just tell you to do something without telling you how?
>You feel anger burn in you as you frown and breath in deep.
>Anger here is not productive, this is just another test.
>Calamity was looking to you to guide her; Joe and Jane were as well.
>You were supposed to be the rock in this situation, the one used to Base operations.
>But Calamity was YOUR foundation.
>You pull her close, making your hip meet her thigh.
>she gives a slight "Yip" in surprise, then settles the side of her head onto the top of yours.
>After a few minutes of waiting, a transport hovers up to you and your group.
>It looks like it isn't made for a crowd, but is built for carrying heavy loads.
>The thought of Wreckage, Grave's giant Donner, comes to mind as you step into the transport, which is most equipped to handle bigger passengers, but a fewer number of them.
>Still there are seats and other amenities for regular size passengers.
>You step onto it and notice a touch screen on one of the walls
>Guiding Calamity to it, you note it has a list of options for places to go, some of them are restricted access areas.
>A few look like they go to the surface.
>You choose the Educational district; an area near the civilian residential areas.
>It houses all the schools and just about anything that can further education, from Colleges, to some trade schools.
>It also has most of the museums.
>And you knew which one you were supposed to take Joe to.
>The Museum of Donner History.
>You settle into a seat as the transport starts moving, only the four of you are on this ride.
>The groundbase zips past as the transport accelerates towards the district, the ceiling displaying fake clouds and a false sun to simulate being above ground.
>Other transports flash past and scatter along the speedways that carry cargo, people, or whatever else needed moving.
>This place was always more uh... Alive, than anywhere you had seen on the surface through Calamity's eyes.
>Yes, those places were are full of people, but they always seemed to just be scraping by, not quite living, but barely surviving.
>And those were just the places that had resources like iron.
>You hadn't seen any farms or things like that because Star-51 didn't feel it was productive to guard them with a patrol of Donners
>That doesn't matter as you watch the entirely urban underground flow past in a blur; a few of the sights you recognize in the distance, but everything in the foreground of your vision is just a blur.
>Joe and Jane sit together, you see their lips moving but can't hear what they are saying.
>Not that it's your business.
>Leaning against Calamity, you feel one of her furry arms wrap around you and pull you to her.
>"What do we do now Sir? We have our own room" She asks, uncertainty in her voice as she looks out of the transport.
>You sigh and lean against her further, pulling her into you.
>"We live Calamity, we do what we want in our free time and work when they ask until we find another goal" you answer, sounding fully confident to Calamity, yet unsure of the answer yourself.
>Is this what the age old saying of "money can't buy happiness" meant?
>FUCK THAT!
>You achieved the goal you had strived for but hadn't planned beyond it; but that didn't mean you were clueless.
>Next was just survive, live and work through everything until you could retire as a handler and she could retire as a donner.
>It seemed simple in so few words, but that was essentially it.
>Do your thing until you couldn't and then enjoy the rest of your life in peace with Calamity.
>That was what master handlers did, now you would too.
>Plus you have this...Project Phoenix you're apart of now.
>You recall opening Jane's chest cavity and seeing it all blocked off, which lights a fire of curiosity in you.
>What is Project Phoenix and why was Joe chosen for it? Why not one of the Master Handlers?
>Doesn't matter now because presently, the large transport has stopped at the Education district.
>It resembles a college campus of the old world, except with fast moving walkways moving Humans to their respective buildings.
>You don't know how they work, but basically you tell the walkway where you're going and it just takes you there.
>Watching it from above nearly gaves you anxiety; everyone always looked like they were going to crash into each other.
>There are of course actual walkways above the walkways, you opt for that instead of some crazy automated thing.
>As you climb a staircase to get to the raised bridges, you see Joe looking down at the people zooming around.
>"They...They look like the inside of an ant nest..." he murmurs as Jane looks over the railing as well.
>"Yea kinda!" Jane remarks, happily tugging Joe along.
>What does the inside of an ant nest even look like? Well, you guess it looks like the people below...
>Maybe next time Calamity is on patrol you could have her find a nest to show you.
>You walk along the pathway, careful not to look down at the constant near collisions of people to a large ornate building.
>White marble columns support a large limestone awning with the words "The Museum of Donner and Handler History"
>It has much less traffic than the rest of the buildings which were for the most part schools, and once you go to a museum not much really changes.
>Still a few groups of school children are being ushered inside the huge building by their Human Handlers -er-...Teachers... As you descend a staircase to enter the building.
>You let go of Calamity and rush forwards a bit to open the door for her, Joe and Jane, then follow them in.
>Old museums with old things have a unique smell to them; a mix of dust, earth and more dust.
>As far as you knew, this museum was the oldest to survive The Last Great War, so it had an extra helping of dusty smells.
>the entry room, despite being well lit, feels dim and open; with more towering pillars of marble supporting a ceiling painted to resemble "the creation of Adam" except it’s a Fox Donner and a human.
>In the center of the round room are a few replicas of famous Donners, including Omega's late donner "Ebrietas"
>"Welcome to the Museum" you say to Joe as you walk past him to catch back up with Calamity.
>Joe looks around mouth agape.
>"What is all this for?" he asks, looking around.
>"Huh?"
>"Why's it so...Big?" 
>You blink at him a few times and then it dawns on you.
>The only BIG structures on the surface had a point; mill steel, cut wood, etc.
>This was big just for the sake of being big and grandiose.
>It probably went over Joe's head.
>And that wasn't an insult to him, he was probably used to things being practical in terms of size.
>He is from the surface, he grew up knowing everything is for a useful purpose; not for just... looking bigger.
>Everything needed a real reason to be bigger and better
>But this new world you are a part of means that big it just for show, and Joe hasn't seen that before.
>How do you explain oversized grandiose?
>Luckily you don't need to as Jane hugs Joe close and explains.
>"The old world emphasized size for importance, as well made things look aesthetically pleasing. This is a place of importance for star-51" she explains quietly as you walk past the displays.
>You give a wry smile and begin the walk through the museum.
>You've seen it all before and have no real desire to explain it all.
>But you had your orders.
>The first section shows a permanently walking robotic frame on a treadmill, half the body covered in a fluffy shell.
>What would they be called in the old world? A fur suit or something stupid like that?
>"This was what there was before Donners, N.O.Bs or "Non organic bodies"" you explain as Joe watches the walk cycle "at one point there was an intelligence in that frame, probably moved to an early donner model"
>Joe looks at you, horror on his face.
>"You mean...This is like a zombie? A reanimated body?" he asks.
>You cough slightly to hide a laugh.
>"A zombie? The processor has been removed; this is just a frame with a walk cycle programmed into it, it's not alive any more than a computer or a calculator" you reply with a grin.
>Still, he looks it over once more.
>"so there's nothing...conscious is in there?" he asks after a moment.
>Jane looks at Joe with more concern than she ever looked at you, and Calamity leans into you with a short impatient sigh.
>You look at the perpetually walking frame and think about what Joe is implying.
>He thinks a consciousness, or a semi consciousness might be alive in that frame, tormented with only being able to walk in a straight line for all time.
>A fate worse than death that for sure, to be alive but only able to walk; but this is just a small series of electrical signals making a robotic frame walk through, no consciousness.
>You understand his concern, you would be worried about anyone willing to subject anyone to that kind of life.
>But...some people in the ground base don't think of Donners as "someone's" but as "somethings".
>A point you would literally fight someone over; in fact more than once Calamity had to restrain you when someone called her a thing deliberately.
>You sigh and look at Joe and answer him.
>"Nothing alive is in there, it's no more alive than an alarm clock" you say with a cold smile.
>Before anything else can be said, you walk away from the ever marching N.O.B.
>Rooms filled with old hidden weaponry, and a few of the still functioning N.O.Bs; too damaged to be transferred for Donners, but functional enough to spend their remaining days explaining their old weapons and gear.
>Honestly it's a good retirement for them.
>You had asked one a while back, when you were a trainee handler.
>They get to teach new handlers, teach new Humans, and it gives them a purpose other than being "outdated" even though they had long outlived their handlers.
>The museum experience is one you've lived through before, but explaining it all to Joe makes it feel more...Relevant...to you again.
>When you reach one of the hidden away areas of the exhibits you almost blush.
>Almost.
>It's about the sexual activity between Donners and their handlers, as well as handlers and N.O.Bs.
>It explains the "tail holes" and why Donners have the organic parts they do.
>You don't explain anything and simply lets Joe read off everything on his own.
>You're sure Jane and him have... explored each other.
>Even if they haven't, they will.
>You simply stand with Calamity, leaning against her softly as Joe learns about handlers and your past.
>Well, handlers pasts.
>You never quite identified as human.
>Sure, you are technically human, but you are a clone of someone from way back when.
>You identify more with the Donners actually
>You are a being MADE; for war, not born like everything else that lives and breathes.
>As you go through the museum you’ve seen probably a dozen times, Joe looks at each exhibit with awe.
>The transition from N.O.Bs to donners.
>The backlash of the public to having donners have actual living parts 
>The Shadows.
>Everything you had known for so long is given to Joe at the most basic level.
>You feel bad for him in a way.
>He is a man pulled out of his depth into a whole new world of violence, luxury, love and pain.
>You know if you had to live on the surface, you would suffer culture shock (and maybe radiation poisoning).
>But for now, you shunt all that aside.
>No time for an existential revelation.
>Finally, you reach the end of the circle of exhibits that all museums have.
>And just like every other museum, they saved the best for last.
>An animatronic of the "Mother of all Donners"
>Lucretia
>The very first working Donner, the base for all Donners, literally Eve.
>But sadly this was just an shadow of her; they sat her down a long time ago and had her answer questions; both simple and complex, just for this.
>She can answer what her name is, but also who she is.
>But those questions haven’t been updated since you first came here, so the animatronic shows its age.
>As you approach it, you lean against a wall as Calamity looks at a propaganda poster from The Last Great War
>"This is the final exhibit, ask her something and let’s get out of here" you say exasperatedly, motioning to the Fox like lady sitting on a simple wooden stool.
>The exhibit is simple; Lucretia, sitting very non-threateningly on a stool and answering questions.
>The room is one of those secluded rooms that all museums have, the ones where carpet covers the walls to drown out noise.
>"This is Lucretia, the first Donner, or at least a representation of her; ask her anything and she’ll answer" Jane says to Joe, motioning to the figure seated politely and waiting.
>"It's an animatronic, it only has set questions" Calamity says to correct Jane.
>"Animatronic am I? Hm, and here I thought you handlers and new Donners could tell the difference" the animatronic says with a bit of annoyance in her voice.
>You jump back, pulling Calamity behind you as you hear her gasp in surprise.
>Jane stares, dumbfounded; while Joe just looks at the exhibit without any concern.
>Lucretia smiles calmly, looking at you and Joe, then at Jane and Calamity.
>"So you are the ones chosen for the phoenix project? I wanted a good look for myself" she says with a smile.
>You want to react, you want to ask what it all means, but before your eyes, she disappears.
>No, not disappear, she uses some kind of stealth.
>It has to be stealth right? Not just her disappearing...
>You stare at the spot where she had been, trying to see through any cloaking field.
>Calamity pulls you close, resting her right arm on your shoulder as it swaps to its weapon.
>"Sir? What’s going on?"
>You put a hand in front of her machine gun to stop her from blowing apart the museum.
>"I think... I think that was a hologram" 
>Joe looks at the spot where Lucretia was.
>"What? What’s going on A.non?"
>You frown and adjust Calamity's weapon to it isn't a danger to anyone by pushing a small release button in it, making it switch back into her paw.
>"That was Lucretia; or a hologram of her. Like we said, she was…Is the first Donner, and as such is the mother to all Donners in way" you say motioning to the spot the hologram had been.
>Had it really been her? Or was it a hologram like you suspected?
>No way to know for now.
>"So what?" asks Joe, looking from you to Jane to Calamity.
>"I-Imagine meeting the VERY first human ever, looking just as young as she has always been portrayed after YEARS of thinking she has been long dead" Calamity says quietly, still staring at the spot Lucretia had been.
>Joe is quiet for a moment then looks at you with a small frown.
>"Omega sent us here so she could see us, didn't he?"
>You nod.
>"I was just thinking that, Why else would he want us to come here and not just get the project started" you answer as you nod pull a scared looking Calamity close.
>"D-do you think she was disappointed in us? Why would she need to see us? What if she has us sent back to the dorms?" she whispers as you guide her away from the display.
>"I don’t know Calamity, lets focus on the fact we aren't in the dorms for now and worry about Lucretia later" you say as you wrap an arm around her waist and give her a gently squeeze.
>Calamity still looks worried as your group walks towards the exit.
>"Wait! Gift Shop! We need stuff to help decorate the room!" Jane's pipes up happily, pulling Joe towards the museum gift shop.
>You follow and smile at Jane's eagerness, heck, maybe you'll find something you like there for decor.
>Gotta make the new place you live into a home, after all there is nowhere to go from there.
>"Calamity, do you wanna go find something to put on display in the new room? We should decorate it" you ask Calamity as you look up at her.
>Almost immediately the worried look slides off her face to one of eagerness, her ears perking and her tail wagging slightly.
>"R-really? We're gonna decorate?" she asks happily.
>You nod once and she rushes off into the gift shops bowels.
>The two of you had agreed a long time ago that decorating a room you weren't going to stay in for long was pointless, she had however always wanted to.
>now she has the chance to.
>As Calamity zooms around, you look over a few things; posters, mini models of older Donners, the usual thing you see at gift shops.
>You’re not paying it all much attention until your eyes fall onto something familiar.
>A knife.
>The exact same knife Joe had on him yesterday.
>You immediately look at the info pertaining to the object.
>"Replica of the Emergency Knife given to Handlers when they would go out into the field with their Donners, few remain intact to this day" the information card reads.
>You look at the card, the knife and then Joe.
>Where did Joe get a replica of an emergency knife?
>...Is it a replica? If it isn't where did he get it? Did his parents kill an old handler, take a trophy and pass it to their son?
>Are his parents Shadow agents? Does that make him a spy?
>Your thoughts are broken By Calamity bounding towards you happily.
>In her arms she has a geode carved to look like a Fox skull, a poster of the schematics of a Donner's light machine Gun and a kitten calendar.
>"These! looky looky! It looks like my head!" she squees happily as she shoves the skull into your hands.
>It's carved from some type of reddish crystal and dark brown stone, and polished to perfection.
>"How much is this?" you say, turning it over in your hands, admiring the workmanship.
>Calamity's ears droop a bit and her tail tries to hide between her toned legs.
>"Uhhh....450 credits...Sir" She says not looking you in the eyes.
>That's enough to get new springs for Calamity's legs!
>You hold the skull more firmly in one hand and reach out and gently cup Calamity's chin with the other.
>Guiding her face to yours, you wait until she looks at you.
>"Do you really want it Calamity?" you ask, holding the skull up slightly.
>She nods, her chin booping your hand as she does.
>"I REALLY like it Sir" she says quietly, her tail wagging a bit.
>"Ok then, just because you're such a good girl" you say, earning an excited "YIP!" from Calamity.
>She grabs you into a crushing hug and kissing you all over your face.
>"THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR!" She cries happily.
>You smile and hug back.
>"You two need a room?" comes a voice over your shoulder.
>Calamity breaks from the hug quickly and you turn around to see Jane Staring at you both with a devilish grin.
>"Not yet we don't, you'll hear when we DO need a room later tonight though" Calamity quips at Jane with a grin of her own.
>Jane fake retches and Calamity Barks out a laugh.
>You simply shake your head then go to the kiosk to pay for everything Calamity picked out.
>All the while the mystery of Joe's knife rattles through your head.
>Another mystery about the mystery Human.
>Another question that only time will answer.
