>Mary spots anon coming down the hall out of the corner of her eye
>She quickly slams the locker shut
>Senior prom is just around the corner
>She's had a crush on Anon since they were kids
>Grew up in the same neighborhood
>Anon was chill, unlike a lot of other humans
>Liked to hang out with her three brothers while growing up
>She snaps out of it. He's about to pass
>Oh no... He's with her.
>"Hey Anon! Hey uhh... Going to Econ?"
>"Yo! How's the weather up there? Yea, it's one of those dual credit courses. Gotta take em' now while they're cheap."
>Her heart sinks a little bit. College. She wonders how her family could possibly afford it. She doubts she would even be able to handle it.
>Focus
>Yeah, no, it's not gonna happen. Not with -her- around.
>"Um... My dad is grilling again tonight and I overheard Matt talking shit about you sucking at Halo or something. I think they wanted you over tonight to do some split screen."
>Anon scoffs, a look of exaggerated indignation on his face
>"I thought dogs were supposed to watch their sodium intake? Tell them i'll be there, and tell Matt I'll kick his ass if he looks at my screen again."
>Dog
>He knows it annoys you when he calls her a dog
>"Oh my god ANON. MANED WOLF!"
>The girl mutters under her breath, "Still a bitch..."
>It's noisy in the hallway, but her ears pick it up easily.
>Falter
>Anon smirks
>"I know I know, Mangy wolf. Got it."
>She flattens her ears and shakes her head, admitting defeat
>"Heh.. well. Anyways, cool! We'll see you after school! Maybe you can teach me how to play this time?"
>Damn, so smooth. She's bought herself a couple hours to think about how she's gonna ask.
>Anon flashes her that perfect smile and does that really cool thing with his hand as he starts off.
>"Yeah totally, it's pretty easy once you get the hang of it. Aaaanyways, gotta run before the bell. Catch you later Mary"
>"See ya, Anon!"

>Mary takes a breath and flexes her core
>The mournful voice of her oboe fills the band hall as she begins her solo
>Pavane Op. 50
>Not her favorite piece, but she found the melody soothing
>Her peers watch on silently. Some impressed, others completely disinterested
>The one other oboist looks like he just had his dreams crushed
>A genuinely moving performance with a flawless piano accompaniment, courtesy of the assistant band director
>She finishes the piece
>Exhales
>Opens her eyes and smiles. She knows she did well
>Amidst the polite claps and low talk, something catches her eye by the door
>Anon is standing there, grinning at Mary like a complete goof
>Oh my god
>He heard the whole thing didn't he
>Holy shit 
>The band director speaks out, "Well done Mary, Faure himself couldn't have imagined it better."
>She looks down at her paws and clutches her instrument to her chest, absolutely embarrassed. She tries to hold back her ridiculous smile, but can't help it. "Uh.. hah, yeah, thanks Mr. Wood."
>"If you could perform a more technical piece with that kind of passion, you're sure to get accepted-"
>Mr. Wood's voice is cut off by the bell. "-Ah, we'll discuss on Monday, Mary. You haven't kept me up to date on your school serach. Have a good weekend everyone!"
>Ugh... College. Wouldn't that be the dream?
>Anon walks up to Mary, a look of surprise still on his face. "Damn, I knew you played and all, but... That was great. Last time I heard you, it sounded like you were playing a duck call."
>Her tail begins to wag
>Anon... Complimented something she's interested in?
>She rubs the back of her head with her free paw and stammers, "Wow... thanks! I mean, not the duck call, but... you know. Thanks!"
>Anon carefully takes the instrument out of your hands to examine it
>It's literally worth twice as much as his car
>She resists the urge to destroy this threat right then and there, before remembering that she very much wants him to like her
>Anon continues, "By the way, I figured you could just ride home with me today since I'm going over to your place and all. That cool?"
>Tail wags even faster
>She yips, "Oh! Yes! Thank you, that would be so great actually."
>Anon hands the Oboe back to Mary with a little less care than She would have liked
>Literally the most expensive thing her family owns
>Mary winces and thanks Anon before swabbing and packing it away
>She wonders to herself how she's going to bring up the topic of prom....

>be anon
>You don't even know how it happened, how you ended up agreeing to prom, and how you ended up in her passionate embrace.
>All you know was that you were spellbound by her soft, hopeful voice
>It was all just so still and silent
>the kiss was so awkward. You didn't even have the first clue as to how to kiss something that wasn't human. Even the whiskers gently touching your face gave you the overwhelming urge to sneeze.
>Her warm, wet nose touched yours for just a moment. Soft lips lingered on yours.
>Before you could react, she straightened up from her crouch.
>She seemed so... different
>So sincere
>So exposed
>Before you even had time to react, her paws slid lazily from your shoulders as she turned to go back inside. "Call me later, ok anon? They're probably wondering what we're doing out here."
>Weren't you playing split screen Halo with her brothers just like.. 5 minutes ago?
>You managed to stammer a dazed, "Yeah..." before the sound of the front door quietly latched behind her
>The short drive home felt like a dream. "Yeah?" That was the best you could come up with right then?
>God you're stupid
>Nevermind that
>But... Wow
>You guess you're taking Mary to prom then
>Don't know how you're going to break the news to Lindsay
>Park your beater in the driveway
>Walk through the front door
>Mom and dad are sitting in the study listening to a talk show
>Dad speaks up. "Hey champ, you got a letter in the mail today."
>They both stand up to give you the letter, grinning in anticipation
>Wax seal
>Princeston
>No freaking way
 
>Be Mary
>As the door latches behind you, you exhale and slump back
>Your heart is racing
>You can hardly believe you just kissed Anon
>Was that too much?
>Is he going to think you're desperate?
>"Yo Mary! What you doing out there with your boyfriend, huh?" comes from the living room
>You flatten your ears and snap back, "None of your damn business Greg, he's not even my boyfriend." It comes out a little more snarley than you expected.
>Laughter erupts from the living room
>Assholes....
>You turn to watch the tail lights through the little window on the door
>Wish you could rewind time and take that kiss back
>God you're stupid
>Walk into the kitchen
>Dad is there with your human mother
>They're whispering something to one another, laughing.
>Notice you walk into the kitchen
>Mother is blushing
>Were probably talking about something you don't want to think about
>Dad leans forward and grins. "Hey string bean, how did your recital go?"
>You smile, still a little proud. "Nailed it. I'll definitely be keeping first chair."
>Before he could respond, you bark out, "Dad can I have money to go to prom?"
>He pauses for a moment in surprise. "Prom? You mean like, dancing, spiked punch, get knocked up in the back seat of a car prom?"
>"Oh my god dad, not YOUR prom."
>Mom elbows your dad in the ribs
>He laughs it off shakes his head. "We'll see about it. Maybe you and your mother can go check out dresses tomorrow. Just don't break the bank, yeah?"
>Howling laughter erupts from the living room again. A cacaphony of roar barks and yips
>You clench your fists and shout at the ceiling, "Oh my GOD, GROW UP!"
>Suddenly feel thankful that one of them is shipping off to boot camp in a couple weeks

>Your heart pounds in your chest so hard you feel it in your ears
>It's been a year since that first kiss... You wanted to do it before he left for Princeston, but This time you'll do it
>You'll show him how much you want him
>All of him
>"Anon... Um.."
>You hook your thumb in your underwear and push them down a little bit
>Fur spills out eagerly
>Oh god.. Any minute now he'll tell you this needs to stop
>You feel so exposed and vulnerable
>Without even realizing it, you tuck your tail between your legs
>"I... I really want this. It's been so hard with you being away. Every night I think about the way it felt to be held."
>Anon stares at you in an almost trancelike state. You can't exactly pinpoint his expression.
>It's now or nothing.
>"You're sure it doesn't gross you out?"
>Anon nods vigorously and stammers something unintelligible
>You feel yourself tremble a little before you begin to step out of your panties
>"Ok... Just... don't laugh."

>Anon did not laugh
>You step out of your panties and stand before your boyfriend
>Never felt so vulnerable in your life... but so excited
>Your face feels like it'll catch on fire
>Take a step towards Anon as he leans in and opens his mouth to speak
>Your nails click gently on the tile of his dorm room floor
>Anon's gaze slowly runs over your body from head to toe. Finally, he speaks.
>"I never realized... Just how amazing you really are."
>You don't think you've heard somebody sound so genuine before
>Your stomach is reeling with emotions. Anticipation. It takes every ounce of control to keep yourself from trembling like a leaf.
>You need to be touched... This overwhelming urge for intimacy
>Close the distance between you and Anon
>You sink to your knees at his feet where he sits
>He reaches out with both hands and begins to rub your head
>Oh god... It's indescribable
>The way his fingers move through your fur
>How he massages your ears
>Calls you a good girl
>If you weren't physically aching for release, you'd never leave this position. This is where everything is right.
>It's right there in front of you though. You can see it through his boxers
>That primal urge is too much to resist. This is yours now.
>You gently grip his shaft through the fabric and rub it up and down
>Notice a visible growing wet spot where pre must be leaking through
>You won't let another drop go to waste
>Before he can say a word, you pull it out through the fabric opening and lean forward to taste your mate
>His reaction is priceless. His hitched breath practically sends you over the edge
>You rub your desperately soaked, needy mound
>Imagining the girth in your mouth entering your body
>The mental image of its length disappearing inside of you, in and out, over and over
>Fuck.. 
>You almost feel high
>Your insides ache
>You look up at Anon with his shaft fully inside of your maw
>Slowly pull your head back
>Lick the tip as it falls from your mouth's warm embrace
>Your voice barely makes it out it's so shaky and quiet. "I want it... all of you."
>Anon's chest steadily rises and falls with heavy breaths. You can tell he's considering something right now.
>"Here..."
>He produces a condom he jokingly bought in a vending machine earlier today
>Fuuuuck... You're not on birth control
>You don't want to use a condom either... You want to feel him inside you, not latex
>You also don't want to have puppies yet
>Maybe... you'll just ask him to stick it in for a second before putting it on
>You need to know what it feels like
>Reach for the condom
>Suddenly feel extremely dirty for what you're about to ask
>"Um... Heh, good thing you got this earlier."
>Your fingers slide into your soaking cunt
>Look into Anon's eyes pleadingly
>"Before you put it on.. can i feel you?"
>You watch his face carefully
>He doesn't seem opposed to the idea. "Uh.. just for a second, it'll probably be fi-"
>You waste no time rising up to straddle your mate
>All you can think about right now is getting him inside of you
>"Just for a second..." you repeat
>guide his shaft between your legs
>Lower yourself down....
>Your body trembles as you take in every inch
>Fuck.. it feels so good. 
>Your paw smoothly glides from the base of his cock to your clit
>Push him back as you begin to bounce up and down on his length
>Not even a moment later, Anon interrupts your rhythm and pulls himself out. "W-wait whoah hold on... This needs to go  on."
>It takes every ounce of restraint you can muster to not put it back in
>You whine, but submit. You're definitely getting on birth control before next trip up to visit.
