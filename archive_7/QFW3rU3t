The Cracked Pearl

Part One: The Demon Lord


“...Once the Beast Races looked upon Man’s great cities and fortresses with envy. For though the Pearlen God had endowed them with the innate gift of magic, they lacked Man’s ingenuity. There was no clearer example of this gap when the Great Sundering of Man began, with each of the ancient Kingdoms claiming supremacy over all of the others. As Man butchered itself the Beast races fled into the depths of their forests and caves. Their magic just barely protecting them. For over 150 years the Great Sundering raged on as legendary Warrior Kings fought and died, their names and deeds recorded for eternity in their great stone tablets.
But to the Beast races, only one man matters, and his name was never written down. He was no self proclaimed God-King, or a towering fighter. He entered history as no more than a peasant carpenter who deserted the armies of Man and fled into the forests where the earliest tribes of the fearsome Wolven dwelled. They took him in as a guest and as payment taught them how to build the sturdy Longhouses that are still in use to this day. He then travelled to the North and encountered the Rams, who worshiped their ancient trees and did not wish to cut them down. He taught them how to carve and build into the goliath trees without causing them harm. It is said that as the Rams slept within their revered Hickory Forests, they were embedded with the ancient magic of the world-a direct connection with the Pearlen God-giving them the powers of prophecy and unending light.
And so the Builder went to all the Beast races, gifting them his knowledge of Architecture. He was no King but he created many Kingdoms in his wake. When he returned to the Wolven, the newly crowned Wolven King, in recognition for his talents, granted the Builder a plot of land to call his own: a small patch of the forest which contained the strongest Oak trees. As the builder, with his Wolven servants, began construction of his new fortress, he took the name Oakenhowler, in reference to both the wood used to build his new home and to the race that had gifted it to him in the first place.
Thus began the official history of House Oakenhowler, a small but respected family that had always been nominally a vassal to the Wolven Kings but in reality ruled independently. Mimicking their semi-mythical founder, they never found themselves embroiled in violent conflict (The great Siege of Oakenhowler by the 23rd Demon Lord, Foxtrot the Fat, is a notable exception). They also never produced any notable generals or warriors in their long history. Instead the family focused more on education and scholarship, producing treatises on a wide array of disciplines. It is a miracle that any of them survive today.
Of course there was an exception to this as well…”

Chapter One

>The Patriarch of Oakenhowler was a busy man.
>His daughter had turned 8 last month, old enough to consider offers of marriages from other families.
>His two older sons, twins, had just gotten into a fight. One of them had managed to chip a tooth.
>And his youngest son kept wetting the bed.
>Then there was the matter of finding a new Captain of the Guard, since his old one had retired after three decades of service.
>And he didn’t have anyone suitable to head an entire guard composed of territorial Wolven that were easy to aggravate.
>Which meant he would have to…write a letter to the King.
>He sighed as he rubbed his temple at his desk.
>This was all distracting him from his passion project.
>A new expansion of the castle, made entirely out of smoothed stone.
>New Oak saplings had been planted only a decade ago, it would be some time before the wood could be harvested.
>True, meshing together the classic Oak with the more oppressive stone would normally clash harshly.
>But with his designs he had sketched out based on the Eastern Gator style of building, he knew he was on to something.
>Plus it might actually save him money since he wouldn’t have to make the stone fire retardant-
>“Sir?” He hears his Steward call out as the door opens.
>The Patriarch sighs.
>“Not yet, Wilson. I still have to pen a letter to his highness-
>“Um, it’s not that sire. I received a rather peculiar message.”
>The Patriarch turns around, obviously not happy at the possibility of something ELSE to distract him.
>“Well don’t just stand there. Out with it.” He said grumpily.
>“W-well, it was penned by a Servant of a family sir, a family that has distant relations with yours.”
>“A Servant?” The Patriarch croaked out in surprise. “Here give me the letter. Do you see that green leather-bound book over there, Wilson? Bring it to me.”
>Wilson nods and quickly runs over to one of the many bookshelves. Among all of thing manuscripts and scrolls, this massive green leather book could probably knock a man’s brains out if swung hard enough.
>“Is this the family tree, sir?” The Steward asks.
>“Volume three of it actually. The other two are around here somewhere…”
>The Patriarch trails off as he opens the letter, frowning at the family name as he flips through the yellowed pages of the book. Dozens of names and even a few illustrations on each page.
>“By the Pearl, what an atrocious Surname.” The Patriarch said to himself as he read the letter.
>This family in question were distant cousins to the Oakenhowlers, at least that what was being claimed by this servant.
>The Husband had been a trader. Him and his wife had been lost at sea along with most of their merchandise.
>Leaving their only child, a son, with virtually nothing.
>The servant scraped up what money was left and brought the child to a small town not far from the Oakenhowler residence, hoping that the Patriarch would take the boy in.
>“Is any of this even true?” The Steward ask, bewildered.
>“Most likely…” the Patriarch responded, rubbing his brow. His long, uncut fingernail pointing to a name on the family tree.
>“Edvin?” The Steward says.
>“A great, great Uncle of mine. Married for love, in return he gave up his inheritance rights and even his family name. He married matrilineally and took his wife’s name.” He sighed as he closed the book.
>“What are you going to do, sire?” The Steward asked.
>“If I took in every 4th cousin who claimed descendant from some fool relative, I’d go straight to a poorhouse from feeding them all!” He exclaimed angrily as he eyed the letter.
>“But it’s strange, he says that the boy is ‘special’ though he says he’s not at liberty to write what it is. He would need to bring the child here to show us.”
>“How old is he?”
>“Six.” The Patriarch answers unhappily.
>“It could be that he is naturally bright and this uh…servant thinks that he could excel with an education.”
>“No child is intelligent at six years old.” The Patriarch grumbles out. “My youngest is six and he shit the bed last night.”
>The man rubbed his eyes. So many problems in his life.
>He just wanted to build his damn extension.
>“Besides, if the boy was just smart he would have said so. He was being deliberately obscure. Something about this is strange.”
>“Shall I arrange a few Wolven go fetch them?” The Steward asked cautiously.
>The Patriarch let out a large sigh, resigned.
>“I suppose, lets see what this nonsense is all about.” 
>As the Steward begins to leave, he turns around briefly.
>“What is the boy’s name again?”
>The Patriarch fumbles for the letter, skimming through it quickly to find his answer.
>“Andioch.”


>“Come on now Andi, don’t dawdle.”
>“Yes Vugo!” The boy said as he quickly ran back to the old mouse’s side. A furred paw nestles comfortably around the child’s shoulder.
>Vugo felt bad for chastising the boy.
>This had been the first time he had smiled in months.
>Throughout their long journey, Andi had simply been quiet. 
>He only spoke when he was spoken too, and even then it was difficult to get a peep out of him.
>Not once did he ever hear him cry.
>He was just…comatose. A body without a soul wading through life.
>Such imagery was beyond grotesque when applied to a child, but it was the only thing he could think of.
>Then Andi saw the large Oak fortress of the Oakenhowler estates.
>And he finally looked like a child again.
>“This place is so big” Andi let out.
>“You’ll have to get used to it” Vugo replies. “It’s going to be your new home.”
>“But what if they don’t like me?” Andi asks timidly. “What if they don’t want me?”
>The mouse ruffled the boys yellow locks of hair.
>“Oh don’t you worry, little master.”
>“They will.”

>‘The court’ as it was referred to was massive.
>It had thick wooden steps leading up to the throne where the Patriarch sat.
>It could have fit a hundred people easily but it was practically empty.
>The guards were stationed outside it’s doors and the only other person besides the Patriarch was the Steward that stood slightly behind the throne.
>Vugo couldn’t help but think it was lonely.
>“Is this the boy?” The Patriarch said gruffly.
>Vugo nodded.
>“Yes. This is little Andi.” He looks down and sees him hiding behind his leg, intimidated by the throne the Patriarch sat on.
>“Come on now, be polite and say hello.”
>Andi did as he was told and slowly shuffled forward.
>He placed his hands on his chest and bowed slightly.
>“H-hello Sire.”
>The Patriarch wasn’t impressed.
>Even at his young age, he could tell the boy was a runt. Small with a skinny frame; an unfortunate combination.
>His blonde locks of hair probably hadn’t been cut since before his parents perished at sea. His hair was naturally wavy but when long enough would curl at the tips.
>It gave him a girlish appearance. 
>His dull, green eyes didn’t help either. They reminded the Patriarch of flawed emeralds that were cloudy and opaque.
>His words weren’t strong or pronounced clearly. His voice stuttered and mumbled.
>Though many young children were like that he supposed.
>With a flick of his finger the child’s awkward introduction was accepted.
>The nervous boy relaxes as he feels Vugo’s arm around him once again.
>He leaned back into the comforts of the old mouse’s fur.
>“He seems like any ordinary boy” The Patriarch mused. “Despite his unfortunate circumstances.”
>“Tell me good servant. What is so peculiar about him that you couldn’t risk writing in a letter?”
>Vugo doesn’t immediately answer the Patriarch. Instead he kneels down to Andi. The Patriarch raises his brow.
>“Do you remember what we talked about at the inn?” The mouse whispered.
>“Y-yeah…” Andi says nervously.
>“You need to show this man. Can you do that?”
>“I think so…but it’s really hard.”
>“I know.” Vugo licks his cheek affectionately, “You only need to do it ever so briefly.”
>“…okay” Andi mutters as he steps forward, Vugo’s hand slide’s off the child’s shoulders as Andi begins to raise his arms.
>The Patriarch narrows his eyes towards the boy. Who seems caught in a trance when he closes his eyes.
>Suddenly a white flash appears, blanketing the whole court in a thick layer of light.
>The Patriarch cries out as he shields his eyes, only managing to lower it when the light begins to dimmer.
>He gasps as he sees the source of it.
>A small glowing orb, pulsating in the child’s cupped hands. 
>His blonde hair was now a transparent white from the glow of the orb.
>Not only could he see it…
>He could hear it, reverberating throughout the room like it was a heartbeat.
>As if it was the blood of the Pearlen God itself, pumping and flowing between each strand of hair on that boy’s head.
>And in a moment, it’s gone. The orb dissipates into nothing.
>The boy’s green eyes practically bulge out of his head as he lets out a loud gasp and falls to the floor on his knees.
>His servant comes quickly to his aid and scoops up the fatigued child in his arms.
>Andi can’t help but nuzzle his head against the mouse’s scruff.
>“Was that fire?!” The Steward lets out, awestruck at the sight.
>“No.” The Patriarch says. He knew what it was, though he never thought he would see it.
>It was light magic. Wielded by a human no less.
>“The magic of the Rams…” The Patriarch muttered to himself.
>“I hope you understand why I didn’t mention this in my letter” Vugo says.
>“How long?” The Patriarch asks, ignoring Vugo’s words. “How long has he been able to do this?”
>“There were signs since he was born. The family wanted to send him to a special school when he was older…before their misfortune.”
> “This is ludicrous!” The Steward said, flabbergasted. “Do you think we’re fool enough to fall for some Pauper’s cheap tri-
> “Wilson.” The Patriarch says sternly, “Be quiet.”
>“No Human can learn magic!” The Steward continued.
>“It’s not unheard of” The Patriarch replied calmly. “Though it is rare. The last record of a Human who could use magic was over 50 years ago. A little girl who died at a young age.”
>He gestures towards the boy, still bundled up in Vugo’s arms. His eyes were closed but his breath was heavy. His chest heaved back and forth as if he had performed some great strenuous physical activity.
>Like that little girl, his health was clearly not great. He wondered if there was a connection.
>“Is he alright?” The Patriarch asks.
>“This…magic Is very tiring for him. He’s passed out the few times he’s done it, though he always comes back to his senses in a few moments. I don’t like to ask it of him very often.”
>The Patriarch nods as he stands from his throne.
>His knees wobble as he plants his feet down on each step.
>“He is a blood relative of yours…” Vugo began.
>“Indeed he is.” The Patriarch responded, the loud smacks of his shoes against the wood jostling Andi from his stupor.
>“And I have shown you what he can do…”
>“Indeed you have.”
>Andi awakens fully and Vugo slowly puts him back down on the ground, supporting the boy as his legs begin to shake trying to steady his small frame.
>He was such a weak looking child.
>And yet showed such promise.
>Andi backs into Vugo, intimidated by the Patriarch towering over him.
>“From this day onward.” The Patriarch declared, his voice booming throughout the empty courtroom. “You will abandon your family name.”
>Andi could could nod meekly at the demands.
>“You will forever title yourself…”
>“As Andioch of Oakenhowler”



Chapter Two

>“Your Pa used to work for the Oakenhowlers as a guard, right Leela?” Slipnook said to his traveling companion as the large castle came into view in the distant horizon.
>“Yeah, but I haven’t been here since I was a pup. These Humies are obsessed with the Oak wood around here.” The Wolven’s voice was a gruff feminine snarl. It unintentionally gave the impression that she was always ravenously hungry.
>Oddly, her Rat companion wasn’t phased by her despite her fearsome voice, or the fact that she stood at least three heads taller than him.
>They couldn’t have been a more different pair.
>Slipnook had solid dark black fur, with a matching black tail instead of the traditional pink one. A rare trait.
>He wore a pair of plain gray trousers and a forwent with any protection in favor of a black shirt with a deep V cut around the collar. 
>His Wolven companion had gray fur, with white streaks curling down from her ears to her muzzle, giving her face an almost mask-like appearance.
>She wore a simple blouse large enough to comfortably contain all the floof in her chest.
>Her tail was particularly bushy, and slipped through a hardy leather skirt that had small metal plates sewn within and was wide enough to give her ease of movement. 
>Slipnook had to stop himself from trying to touch and fluff up her tail on more than one occasion. Less he risk being eviscerated by the notoriously short tempered Wolven.
>“Well they do have the word ‘Oak’ in their name after all” the Rat replied.
>“Whatever” Leela huffed out, “One torch could set this whole place up in flames.”
>“Hey.” Slipnoot said, turning to her, his normally pleasant demeanor turned serious.
>“Stop with that kinda talk. The old man around here is particularly stingy. We got enough of an uphill battle already.”
>“Oh come on, this has to be a pile of dung” Leela spat onto the ground. “A Humie who knows magic? It’s ridiculous.”
>“It’s worth looking into-
>“Some rumor sang by some lute player looking for some coin to be thrown into his cap. Are you going to chase every tall tale?”
>“The Patriarch wrote back, Leela.” Slipnook said coolly. His voice was light, it almost seemed to dance in the air like a feather. Leela was always wary of his gift of gab. “He practically confirmed it for us.”
>“I’ll believe it when I see it.” The Wolven replied grumpily
>“Well it looks like it won’t be long…” Slipnook said as they saw a group of soldiers at the checkpoint before the castle proper.
>“Halt!” The guard said, the wolven eyeing the strange, well armed pair. “These are the lands of Oakenhowler. What business do you have here?”
>They guard their lands jealously… Slipnook thought.
>“I am Sir Slipnook of the Veranian Holdings. This is my traveling companion, Leela of Highforest.”
>It couldn’t be known if they had heard of Slipnook.
>But they recognized the second name immediately.
>The guards mumble amongst each other, Leela only sighs in frustration.
>Slipnook digs his paw under his collar, his hooked claws pulling up a small piece of parchment.
>“I have business with the Patriarch. I have this letter from him stamped with his seal.”
>The guard takes it and cautiously and begins to read it.
>Slipnook wasn’t even certain if he could read.
>But they all would recognize that seal.
>A stump of a tree with an axe on either side.
>The guard grunts before handing the letter back.
>“I’ll provide an escort to the castle proper.”
>Leela only nodded as the guards let the pair through.
>She couldn’t help but roll her eyes as Slipnook spoke however.
>“Our journey has been quite long…” Slipnook began.
>We stopped at the last town over! Leela thought.
>“We could use some food or drink if you have any to spare.
>He literally drained the last of his wine sack less than an hour ago.
>“We have some bread and bit of mead.” The guard says as one of his man brings a few slices of bread and a small corked bottle over to the two.
>Leela declines the offer…but Slipnook.
>He greedily devours most of the bread and almost squeaks as he glugs down the mead.
>Just because he was a Rat didn’t mean he had to act like one, Leela thought grumpily.

>The trek itself to the castle was tedious, especially with no horses. But the path was flat and straight forward.
>Either side of the road was littered with still growing Oak trees that had been planted at least a decade earlier if not longer.
>The Oakenhowlers carefully cultivated their precious Oak trees so that they would never run out of the famous wood. Lumber that was only matched by the Hickory trees of the Rams.
>As they came closer and closer to the great castle, Slipnook couldn’t help but marvel at it.
>A castle built completely from wood so effectively that it survived a siege against a Demon Lord hundreds of years prior.
>...Well it was almost completely made from wood.
>He noticed there was stone on the Eastern wing of the castle.
>“That wasn’t there when I was a pup.” Leela mentions, “It must be a new extension to the fort.”
>Slipnook nods, with all the saplings still growing he wondered if the family just couldn’t harvest enough oak and decided for simple stone instead.
>A break from tradition but it skillfully blended in with the wood.
>At least that’s what his eyes told him…yet he couldn’t understand how that was the case.
>It was like one of those magic picture drawings street vendors in the bigger cities would use to play tricks on you.
>As they arrive at the drawbridge the guard stops them.
>“At this point I must ask for you to relinquish your arms.”
>Leela and Slipnook look at each other and merely shrug as they unloosen their scabbards.
>Slipnook had a two handed longsword that was often slung to his back. Because of his short height, it would have just dragged on the floor had it been placed around his waist.
>Leela surrendered a pair of sabers, curved ever so slightly with elaborate hilt guards crafted to wrap around the hands for protection.
>“Out of curiosity” Slipnook asks as the guard takes their weapons. “You wouldn’t happen to know anything about a Human who can wield magic? Strange question I know.”
>Leela was more convinced that the rumor was indeed true with the guard’s casual shrug than anything Slipnook had told her.
>“Something like that yeah” The guard says nonchalantly. “No one sees much of him outside the castle.”
>“Him?” The rat said, happy that he got some scrap of information. The Patriarch was keeping this close to his chest.
>“Could we get a name?” Leela asked, her curiosity suddenly piqued as well.
>“Nope. Sorry Ma’am.” The guard said as he motioned for them to enter the castle properly.
>“I doubt anyone beyond those walls knows his name.”
>The pair exchange odd glances with each other as they begin to walk into the depths of the castle.
>“I hope he doesn’t lose our weapons…” Leela mutters.
>“Always the damn swords with you” Slipnook mutters back. “You need to find a mate to get attached to instead.”
>He hears a quiet growl behind the Wolven’s sharp set of teeth.
>“I’d smack you for that if we were anywhere else.”
>Slipnook gives her a devious smirk.
>“I know.”
>Two guards are at entranced to the courtroom. 
>They nod silently, permitting the pair to enter.
>It had only just occurred to the Rat just how small the levy was in Oakenhowler.
>The family couldn’t have more than 500 soldiers total.
>The court itself, just like everything else, was made from wood.
>The Floors and walls were painted black or gray and much to Slipnook’s surprise and worry he could see torches lit all around, lighting up the room.
>Leela, who herself had never been in the castle proper before. Only thought about how empty the whole place looked.
>What was the point of building such a place if no one actually lived in it?
>“You have requested an audience with me!” An old voice croaked now. “And now you have it.”
>“I hope for all of our sakes you have not wasted my time.”
>Leela couldn’t believe this.
>Even the damn throne was made of Wood!
>Sat upon it was an old man in a thick, blue robe.
>His beard was short and scraggly, his withered mustache curled into his lip.
>His plain brown eyes did little to hide their hawk like precision as they fixed on the two Beasts-races.
>“My lord” Slipnook began, giving a slight bow. Leela awkwardly followed suit.
>“I am Sir Slipnook of the-
>“I know who you two are!” The Patriarch grumpily snapped back.
>“A Minotaur Slayer and a infamous duelist have been writing letters to me about matters that don’t concern them. They then have the audacity to demand an audience.”
>“It was a request, not a demand.” Slipnook attempted to politely correct.
>“What. do. you. want?” The elder say slowly.
>Leela could not help but relish in the fact that the Rat’s honeyed words had turned into black tar out of nowhere.
>Slipnook cleared his throat and began again.
>Talk about a tough crowd.
>“We have been commissioned by a group of…influential peoples, the Wolven king among them. To recruit a small group of talented individuals to carry out a task.”
>The Patriarch narrowed his eyes.
>“I never heard anything of the sort.”
>It was hard to believe that a man with such a small army was so suspicious of everyone.
>...Actually that may have been the reason why.
>“This is a very…sensitive subject. Secrecy is paramount. We’re trusting that you can appreciate our goals…and that of your king.”
>Slipnook saw the Patriarch’s face twitch at that last comment. It was a veiled threat and they both knew it.
>But he wasn’t going to be pushed around by some tottering old man.
>Leela couldn’t help but remember when Slipnook lectured her about her language.
>“Fine.” The Patriarch said as he leans back in his chair, getting comfortable. Having surrendered in this small battle of wills.
>“State your business freely. Nothing will be uttered outside these walls.”
>Slipnook gives a small bow of gratitude, his small black eyes gleamed from the lit torches.
>Seriously? How did this place not burned down?!
>“We have been tasked by group of Lords with a common interest to slay the current Demon Lord, Kolonus.”
>The rat pauses to allow the Patriarch to absorb this information before continuing.
>“We’ve also been assigned to recruit a select few who have skills that we require. There are four of us already and we need a fifth.”
>“We’ve heard rumors of a Human of Oakenhowler who knows magic.” Leela said bluntly, butting in. “We figured it was something worth looking into.”
>The courtroom is quiet as the Patriarch furrows his brow at this revelation. Only the cracklings of the fires echo throughout the chamber were heard. Which only added even more gloom and loneliness to the barren hall.
>“Kolonus reign has been quiet” The Patriarch finally said. “He never raids, nor has he once raised an army. Why kill him and risk his replacement being more aggressive?”
>“Quite frankly he’s a blessing in disguise. The Northern lands haven’t been this peaceful since I was a boy.”
>Leela and Slipnook exchange glances, surprised that the Old man would actually consider defending a Demon Lord of all things. Even if there was a point to be made in that regard.
>Still the more…zealous followers of the Pearlen God in certain cities would have had his head for heresy.
>“That is true…” Slipnook began. “But recent developments have made the Lords nervous.”
>“Such as?”
>Slipnook looks back to Leela, was he really just going to put everything out in the open? This isn’t how his employers wanted things to be done.
>Leela can only shrug.
>He sighs and turn back to the Patriarch.
>“The Order of the Trident has been sending messages to Kolonus.”
>The Patriarch sucked in his teeth at the mere mention of the name.
>“Lunatics, traitors, and scoundrels. Who cares what they do?”
>“They conquered a fortress two years ago!” Slipnook replied. “They already have a base of operations!”
>“One run down tower occupied by glorified bandits is no reason to go slay the most passive Demon Lord we have ever had.”
>“Your Lord cannot afford those two powers to begin an unholy northern alliance-
>“Do not speak to me about the affairs of my Lord!” The Patriarch snapped back.
>“You and your companion are errand boys sent by a paranoid king to clean up a mess that doesn’t exist.”
>Slipnook couldn’t believe what he was hearing.
>A Demon Lord needed to be slayed.
>That alone should be reason enough for this miserly old fool!
>How could he be so close minded about this?
>Leela could have told him that though.
>The Oakenhowlers rarely bothered with the politics of the outside world.
>They were almost as bad as the Rams.
>Slipnook’s mind is racing.
>Is there anything he can do to salvage this?
>This dammit! Think!”
>“Um I-I heard your daughter’s marriage fell through.”
>Leela can’t help but stare daggers at her companion.
>What the hell are you doing?
>The Patriarch raises his eyebrow at the strange remark.
>“Yes. The marriage was arranged when she was still a child. The suitor was ungrateful enough to die of the pox before the ceremony could be carried out in good faith.”
>“What if I could promise her another suitor… a um… better one?”
>Oh man he was really gonna get yelled at for this.
>“Explain yourself.” The Patriarch said surlily, interpreting the Rat’s words as a bad joke. 
>“Well you see, sire…” Slipnook began, trying to compose himself.
>Come on, just use some of that good old charm.
>Works wonders on Leela when it counts…
>“One of the Lords who employed us is the Magistrate of the Veranian banks. Very wealthy, influential, well respected…and has an unmarried son of…18 years of age.”
>It was either an 18 year old son or an 81 year old uncle.
>In his nervousness he couldn’t quite remember.
>“If you agree to recruit your son into our cause. In return such a thing could be arranged.”
>“And also!” Leela stated, catching on to Slipnook’s game. “A Member of Oakenhowler will be recorded as slaying a Demon Lord. A Human with magic no less! Think of the prestige.”
>Despite the mawkish tone, the point managed to stick.
>Old men are concerned with two things:
>Their legacy
>And who their daughters marry.
>“You can promise this marriage for me?” The Patriarch ask.
>“I speak as their representative” Slipnook said proudly.
>Leela had to stop herself from rolling her eyes.
>He was so full of shit.
>Here was hoping that the Magistrate wouldn’t flog off half of his fur for this.
>Then again he could always talk his way out of anything.
>Still, something seemed off about all of this.
>It was too…quick. Too clean.
>‘Hey can we borrow your son to slay a Demon Lord?’
>‘No’
>‘What if we get your daughter married.’
>‘Okay!’
>Is that really all it took?
>Did these nobles really look at their children as commodities that could be pawned off?
>What was she saying, of course they did.
>“We want to meet him though” Slipnook said, cutting off Leela’s train of thought.
>“We need to know how good he is.”
>The Patriarch grunted as he slowly rose up.
>“I’ll arrange it tomorrow, you are guests in my home for the evening.”
>The pair begin to bow, but his back has already turned from them as he heads out a back door.
>“Oh and by the way” The Patriarch said before leaving.
>“The boy isn’t my son.”
>He isn’t? Slipnook thought, confused.
>Leela had another thought however:
>Boy?! Like as in a child?


Chapter Three

>Early the next morning the two were ushered down into the basement levels of the castle.
>Where…everything is made out of stone.
>No…it wasn’t just stone, Slipnook thought.
>It was cement blocks!
>Talk about a change in the scenery.
>He didn’t think this castle could get any more somber, what with empty halls made from dark oak wood.
>But now Slipnook was walking down into a dungeon made from cement.
>This had to be the strangest castle he ever slept in.
>Leela on the other hand was used to most of it’s peculiarities 
>Though she didn’t recall it being so empty all of the time.
>“Forgive me for sounding rude…” Slipnook began, “but is it really necessary to meet him in in such a..environment.”
>The Patriarch brushed off the comment with a wave of his hand.
>“Having the boy showcase his skill elsewhere, especially outside would…incite the superstitions of the locals. I like things to remain quiet.”
>Slipnook couldn’t help but frown.
>“I hope he doesn’t live down here.”
>“By the Pearl, No!” The Patriarch said, sounding offended. “He has his own room with a window overlooking the forest. But when it comes to his studies and his…innate talents I take precautions.”
>“How old is this ‘boy’?” Leela said, cutting off Slipnook before he could respond to the Patriarch.
>“14 Summers as of this year. Though you wouldn’t know it by looking at him.”
>“How so?” Leela asked, already annoyed that her suspicions were confirmed.
>“He’s a short lad, always was, and skinny too.”
>The Patriarch cuts the conversation short when they go through two large stone doors.
>Inside is a large, square room. Not unlike a training arena of sorts for mercenary guilds or guard barracks.
>Even with all the torches and braziers lit, the place still seemed dim and gloomy.
>And also quite hot, there was no ventilation.
>Leela could already feel her thick fur stick to her.
>In front of them was a Wolven, an older one by the look of his withered, brown fur.
>But it was the person next to him that interested the pair the most.
>A small hooded boy, his face obscured and his feet were bare.
>His skin was pasty white and speckled with dirt.
>Perhaps it was soot from all these damn fires.
>As the Patriarch said, he was short, barely five heads tall. Shorter than Slipnook even, who was five and a half heads and much shorter than Leela, who Slipnook was certain was pushing seven heads.
>In his hands he carried a simple wooden staff, with a diamond embedded at the tip.
>It was a strange contrast to the shoddy plain brown clothes and robe he wore.
>Especially when it seemed to glow from reflecting the fires.
>In fact Slipnook had never seen a noble so plainly dressed before.
>Though perhaps these were training clothes that could be tainted with dirt and sweat.
>“How has the boy been?” The Patriarch asked the servant.
>“Well behaved as always, my lord. Though perhaps a little shy in anticipation of our guests.”
>Slipnook found this amusing.
>He actually thought the hood on the child to be quite foreboding.
>Now he realized it was because he was trying to hide his face.
>“Come on now, Andi,” The servant nudged him. “Don’t be a stranger.”
>The boy slowly lifted his hood back.
>The rat’s eyes softened upon the sight.
>Leela only let out an unimpressed ‘hmph’
>“Um…Hello.” His voice was light and even a bit jittery, practically a squeak.
>He wringed his hands across his staff he seemed so nervous.
>“I am Andi of Oakenhowler. I am very please to..ah, meet you.” 
>His hair was blonde with a soft, pleasant texture that was cut short.
>His face was fair and long with slightly sunken cheeks.
>His lips were thin and and wispy but was accompanied by a strong, angular jaw.
>He had dark green eyes that seem to dart all over.
>Slipnook couldn’t help but think that a few aunts in his family would die at the sight of such a boy and adopt him immediately.
>Leela folded her arms, continuing to display her indignation.
>She couldn’t believe she have come all this way for a child.
>“Andi,” The Patriarch said calmly.
>This was the first time Slipnook ever heard a touch of gentleness from the ornery old man.
>“These two are very interested in your gifts. Could you show them?”
>Andi quietly nods.
>“Um… you’ll….you’ll have to stand back please.”
>The servant quickly moves to the Patriarch’s side as the elder takes a few steps back.
>Slipnook and Leela follow suite, though not without the Wolven rolling her eyes.
>What could some silver spooned child possibly do?
>“Is there anything specific you wish to see?” The boy asks suddenly, cutting off Leela’s train of thought.
>He wasn’t asking the Patriarch.
>He was asking them.
>Leela only replied with an annoyed glare that made the boy shirk.
>“Um, anything at all!” Slipnook said, quickly nudging his companion in the rib.
>“Oh, um, okay. That’s fine.” Andi said as he turned his back to them.
>Leela couldn’t help but catch a glare from the Rat.
>Before she could return the gesture there is a blinding light in the room.
>Both Leela and Slipnook feel their hairs stand on edge.
>They hear a ringing slowly start up in their minds as particles of light dance around them.
>But it wasn’t a loud or intrusive ringing.
>It was peaceful and low. It reminded Slipnook of a chant from a funeral.
>Leela’s eyelids began to flutter.
>Not from resisting an urge to sleep.
>But from resisting the temptation to close her eyes and embrace this feeling of light before her.
>This light that spread throughout this dark dreary room.
>And turned it into a place touched by the Pearlen God.
>That diamond within the boy’s staff radiated the light and yet was empowered by it simultaneously.
>It was a paradox.
>It was true magic.
>Andi, seemed to be the only one unfazed by the spectacle, as if he was unaware of the calibre of his ability.
>Suddenly there is a loud noise, almost like an elongated screech.
>Slipnook likened it to a stream of light being unsheathed from a scabbard
>There is a loud crack as a beam of light shoots from diamond and slams into the concrete wall.
>Andi grits his teeth and tightens his hold on the staff as the light seems to practically drill into the concrete.
>And then in a moment.
>It fizzles out.
>And the room went dark, the torches and lamps had seemingly drowned in the abundance of light.
>All that could be heard was the rough panting of Andi.
>After a moment, Slipnook and Leela’s eyes adjusted to the darkness.
>And they see the boy, on his hands and knees with his hooded robe crumpled around his small frame.
>Slipnook runs to Andi, putting his arm around the boy’s chest and gently pulling him towards the rat.
>“I…I can do more.” Andi sputtered out.
>“No. It’s fine, lad. You did more than enough.” Slipnook replied, resting Andi’s head on his shoulder.
>Leela slowly walks over as the Patriarch shouts for the servant to relight all the torches.
>“Tell me…” Leela said coolly, hiding her own amazement at the spectacle the child showed her.
>“What were you educated in?” She asked “Any Rune magic or-
>“N-no.” Andi said before letting out a hard cough. “My studies were more practical, Ma’am.”
>The way his soft voice squeaked out a reply irritated her.
>Even more irritating was that he called her ‘Ma’am” like she was one of his doddering old servants.
>“I’m familiar with the four scales” He continued. “I started with Veheram the Monstrous, then Gadfly the Mercurial, followed by Hazel the Forlorn. I finished my readings with Maurianna the Golden.”
>Leela didn’t reply, evidently satisfied with the answer. Which also irritated her.
>Slipnook could only frown. He was happy that with the darkness the boy’s human eyes couldn’t see it.
>He looks over at the Patriarch, barking orders about lighting the torches.
>He didn’t bother teaching him how to read basic runes?
>Or even some standard beginners magical texts from the sound of it.
>Just started off the poor boy with the rambling, obtuse texts of the dragon sages?
>And in that strange order too?
>Slipnook never even picked up any of the Four Scales, let alone read them.
>But even he knew you didn’t start off with Veheram the Monstrous. A Scion of the Crimson Deity.
>Especially to an impressionable young boy cooped up in this castle.
>The boy’s breathing softens and his hair, with a texture like that of silk, rustles against the rat’s own coarser, rougher fur.
>He was such an innocent child, Slipnook thought.
>“Fainting after one spell isn’t impressive.” Leela said, breaking Slipnook’s concentration.
>“Are we gonna carry him after one magic blast?” She jeered.
>Slipnook sighed.
>Why was she always so difficult.
>“Maybe.” Slipnook replied, turning his head towards the Wolven. “With his light magic I’d think it be worth it. And that was one heck of a blast either way.”
>“Pffft, you’re too easily impressed” Leela said. “We know fire dancers in the south that could do-”
>“Leela.” Slipnook said sternly.
>Even he was beginning to lose patience with her.
>“Now is not the time to be discussing this.” He gestures with his head over to the boy, who had passed out, his face buried in the crook of Slipnook’s elbow.
>The pair’s eyes water for a moment as the torches finally light up again. 
>The elderly Wolven servant kneels down and takes the boy from Slipnook and gingerly cradles him in his paws.
>“Let him rest for the day.” The Patriarch said, “And give him some sweets from the kitchen when he awakens.”
>The servant bows his said and silently leaves.
>Leela couldn’t help but scoff, she never figured out why these Wolven, someone like her own Father, who towered over their masters, felt compelled to serve these humans
>The Patriarch steps towards the two. Slipnook can see a smirk beginning to form on the old man’s face.
>“I’ve showed you enough” He said confidently.
>“Indeed” replied the Rat. “Let’s talk. I’ve got some questions.”


>“A cousin?” Leela ask.
>The Patriarch nodded.
>“More like a distant relative than even a cousin. But yes, I suppose so. The boy’s parents died years ago. So I took him in.”
>“A very kind gesture” Slipnook interjected, trying to butter up the old man.
>“Indeed” was the curt reply.
>“Though I do wonder that if I send him off to you, will he be coming back in a coffin?” The Patriarch said.
>“I have to agree” Leela added. “He’s much too young for something like this and his health is-
>“Enough.” Slipnook said firmly, directed more at Leela than at the elder.
>She had been acting difficult ever since she saw Andi.
>“Light magic against a Demon Lord is like bringing flame to grease. It’s simply too good to pass up. We are all seasoned fighters with good reputations. I’m confident we can keep the young lad safe.”
>Then the Rat turned to Leela, his pure black specks of eyes forming only the slightest of glares at her.
>“And a good bit of traveling should help with improving his physical ailments.”
>Leela only rolled her eyes and scoffed at the excuse.
>The Patriarch leans into his chair, crossing his legs as he sips on some tea. The black liquid staining his beard.
>“You said yesterday there were four of you. Who are your two other comrades?”
>Slipnook clears his throat.
>“Madam Delilah of the Lilly Swamps to the South, and Anun, a warrior to the Northeast of great physical strength.”
>The Patriarch nodded approvingly.
>Actually that maybe was the first time either one of them had seen the ornery old man look satisfied.
>“I know of those two…” he lets out a sigh and folds his hands. “Very well, there is always a risk with these sorts of things. But I am content. I will permit the child to travel with you.”
>“Assuming of course that the marriage agreement with my daughter was said in good faith.”
>Leela flashed Slipnook a wicked, sadistic grin.
>“Uh, y-yes. Of course sire” Slipnook sputtered nervously. “I am of course a representative of-
>“Oh don’t go into all that nonsense again” the Patriarch let out grumpily. “If there’s one thing I hate it’s people going off about their titles and duties.”
>He waves his hand away, dismissing them from his study chamber.
>“Go back to your lords, once I have a marriage agreement in writing you may send for the boy. My guards will provide you with a few days worth of provisions and you’ll have your armaments back.”
>Both of them bowed, though Slipnook noticed that Leela’s body felt strained.
>And he could also tell she was grinding her teeth.
>She had been acting so difficult since they had arrived.
>Still, he needed to stay focused on the task at hand.
>“Before we leave, my Lord” Slipnook requested, “May we talk to little Andi before we depart.”
>“No” The Patriarch answered flatly. “You’ve taken up enough of the boy’s time and mine as well.”
>Slipnook felt that it was the latter that was actually important.
>“You will have plenty of time for idle chit-chat in the future. But it won’t be in my abode.”
>Slipnook bowed deeper.
>Leela didn’t bother.
>“My apologies my Lord. We will trouble you no more.”

>With that the pair left and Slipnook couldn’t help but feel slightly disappointed by the whole experience.
>Here was an ancient family, a truly ancient one that could accurately and without forgeries, trace their bloodline back to the Great Sundering.
>Slipnook could only recall maybe five families total who had such prestige.
>Their fortress was something out of a dream, a castle made of thick oak with a baked brown color with only bits of stone added on later.
>A wooden fortress that despite all the torches that littered the palace-and was even once a siege by an infamous Demon lord in the annals of history-had never once burnt down.
>And yet the whole place felt like an abandoned ruin, occupied only by its Wolven guard, a few servants, and a solitary, ornery old man who didn’t care for anything beyond his hard oak halls.
>It all felt so…drab. He couldn’t imagine living in a place like this as a child, and never being able to leave.
>Leela wasn’t so sympathetic.
>“He’s spent his short little life in privilege and splendor. And now we’ll have to babysit the little tot.”
>“I wouldn’t use the word ‘splendor’ to describe that place” Slipnook replied as he slid his longsword back around his shoulder where it hooked onto the sling.
>“When I was a pup, we were so poor we had to paw in the mud to find roots we could eat” Leela spat out, her bushy tail was straight up and rigid, indicating openly her foul mood.
>“And the only escape from that wretched living was when Pa got a job as a guard. We had to scrape by serving those puny humans.”
>“Leela…”
>“And now, after all this time. After all of this, I still have to serve some noble brat!”
>“Leela!”
>The Rat’s otherwise chipper and friendly voice had turned stern and taciturn. The contrast was enough to silence Leela, who otherwise towered over her companion.
>“You’re lucky we left the outpost. Do you want the guards in earshot of you?”
>“As if they would disagree with me. You think any of these Wolven want to serve some decrepit old human and his spoiled children?”
>“Is that what this is all about?” Slipnook shot back, “you’ve been sulking ever since we got here because Daddy had to go on guard duty?”
>Leela is silent.
>“You are here for the same reason all of us are: because we are professionals with a job to do.”
>“He isn’t.”
>“And so far, Leela, you’ve acted like more of a child than he has. The boy is coming with us, he’s too useful. Get over it.”
>Slipnook could hear the Wolven’s noise whistle as she inhaled angrily.
>“At the next inn, I want a separate room from you.” She spat out.
>Slipnook sighed. The road back home was going to be long.


Chapter Four

>Thankfully, the suitor Slipnook had mentioned to the Patriarch was indeed 18.
>And also thankfully, the suitor’s Father, the Magistrate of the Veranian banks did not flog half the rat’s fur off.
>Like all bankers he had hid any frustration with this arrangement until the perfect moment.
>For after two whole seasons of angrily scribbled letters, it seemed the two miserly elders had finally met their match and a marriage agreement was settled.
>The Patriarch would give a hefty dowry for his daughter. More than was normally expected.
>But in return he paid none of the ceremony costs. That would all come out of the Magistrate’s vaults.
>The fact that the bride and groom to be were entirely different species didn’t even seem to cross their minds. It was the business and who was paying what that took priority.
>And that’s when the Magistrate got his revenge.
>He deemed that Slipnook as the “initial negotiator” had an obligation to pay a certain proportion to the wedding costs.
>A measly 10% total.
>Which pretty much left the wayward Rat penniless and landless. Selling his modest home along with all it’s furnishings was barely enough to cover the costs.
>Refusing was…not really an option.
>The warrior had to move in with Leela, who had a small room rented in the same city, waiting for their job proper to finally begin in earnest after all this marriage nonsense was settled.
>She made him sleep on the floor at the foot of her cramped bed as if he was her pet.
>Mainly because she found it amusing. Though she couldn’t help but feel sorry for the poor rat’s unfortunate change in fortune.
>Though in the end it was his own damn fault.
>She hoped he still had faith in that boy, it had cost Slipnook basically everything.
>Slipnook, for his part, had taken this whole ordeal with a jovial smile.
>He was still a knight after all, with a strong reputation and powerful patrons.
>He reasoned he could make his fortune back after only a couple of years.
>The sheer strength of his optimism frankly stunned the she-wolf.
>Though Leela did notice that Slipnook had taken to drinking her Lavender wine more often…
>No one’s perfect.

>Eventually it came time for their quest to finally begin.
>The group would meet up in a small village just outside of Veranian Holding’s domain.
>Dehlia and Anun would already be there.
>And the Patriarch of Oakenhowler had confirmed in a letter that the boy was to be transported by way of a cart and horse.
>Then they would plan their route to the Northern domain of all the Demon Lords: The Foul Curse.
>The pair packed lightly for their journey, taking only a spare change of clothes, their rations, weapons, and a small pack of supplies such as tinder and rope.
>No horses for them, or for the group as a whole. There wouldn’t be enough natural springs or wells for the horses to drink from.
>Especially when they got further north and all civilization basically vanished…
>Horses could also be easily tracked and they needed to stay as inconspicuous as possible.
>Especially if the Order of the Trident was going to be involved in any way.
>Right before they left the city for the road, the Magistrate delivered them a portion of their promised fee upfront. To help with the road ahead.
>Leela couldn’t help but snicker as his messenger was told to entrust all the money to her, and to give nothing to Slipnook, as one final insult.
>“I think you need to find a new place to live afterwards.” Leela said as she stuff the bag of coins down her shirt, engulfing the small leather sack in her gray fluff. “The Magistrate will make your life miserable otherwise.”
>“My whole family lives here.” Slipnook replied, shrugging. “Ma would be heartbroken if I moved anywhere else. It’s bad enough that I’m on the road so much as is.”
>Leela couldn’t relate to the sentiment. The moment her own family had felt she was efficiently weaned off the family they had… “encouraged” her to be more independent and live on her own.
>Mainly on the account that her parents kept having more pups that needed to be fed, the sooner the older children could leave the pack, the better.
>She could still remember as a small pup watching her Father chase away her older brothers, sometimes with a weapon, only to have the same thing happen to her a decade later.
>“Leela, are you okay?” Slipnook said as he strapped his longsword across his back. “You got that look in your eye.”
>“Yeah, sorry.” She hastily replied, “Let’s get going. We need to get to the village before the brat gets there first and gets into trouble.”
>“True, he’s never been outside of that gloomy fort, he’ll definite be out of his element…and you shouldn’t call him that. He was a nice enough boy.”
>“Hmph!” Leela snorted, “He’s a noble, he can’t be that nice.”
>“Technically I’m a noble too.” Slipnook pointed out.
>“That’s different and you know it!” Leela shot back.
>“All I’m saying is that he’s going to be travelling with us for some time” Slipnook said. “He’s a meek enough boy as is without one of his companions sneering at him all the time.”
>Leela was silent, the Rat’s words were enough to shame her, if only momentarily.
>“Leela?”
>“Whatever, let’s just get going.”


>The Sun rose on a cloudy day so that only small rays of bright orange beamed to the ground.
>The grass was still slick with dew as a small group of men and beast, clad in black and brown cloth quickly emerge from the mouth of the forest. 
>They looked worse for wear; there were cuts across their faces and their clothes were torn around the legs and torso.
>This was especially in contrast to the man who was standing before them, waiting for their arrival.
>He had a thick, dark blue velvet cloak which covered and wrapped around his entire body.
>The only thing that could be made out beneath the cloak were his large shoulder pauldrons which jutted out, making his cloak even wider and giving him a majestic, perhaps an even royal look.
>He was clean shaven with a chin that jutted out. His high cheek bones and his cropped, black hair gave him a handsome quality.
>Despite his masculine look, he barely appeared to be past the age of 20. His face still looked too fresh and new.
>“You’re late.” He said sternly, with a low, quiet voice. “And with fewer numbers.”
>“We had tracked the Muscular one” spoke a fox beast who had a slight gash on his muzzle. “He was travelling across the plains just to the north of the Wolven forests. When he fled into their domain we followed after him and skirmished a few times. But the Wolven patrols slowed us down and he got away, we lost ten to their soldiers before we escaped them.” 
>“How many are there of you now?” The man asked. 
>“18 sire.”
>“Hmm, not great, but with my talents it will be more than enough.”
>“We think they plan on cutting through the Wolven forests again and going north straight through the plains to the Foul Curse.”
>“That will not happen. Demon Lord Kolonus must remain unmolested by these would-be assassins. We will block them off and kill them here.”
>“The Muscular one is no more than a day ahead of us. He is probably meeting the rest of them at the nearby village.”
>“How many do they number?” The man ask.
>“No more than four we believe” was the reply.
>“Then it is decided!” The man said, “we will ambush them outside of the village’s borders and eliminate them right then and there.”
>“These are not regular mercenaries, sire” The Fox replied. “These are warriors and mages with skill.”
>The Man smiled as a gloved clenched fist protruded from the opening of his cloak.
>The Fox could feel the ground beneath him begin to rumble ever so slightly.
>“I am far more skilled than they are.”


>“Ayy, Master Rat, she be right over there.”
>The Bartender, a thick Bear Beast pointed his one hooked claw over to the corner of the dimly lit pub.
>There awkwardly sat one of the Turtle-folk, trying to look as small as possible.
>Despite what everyone often said about the little seen race, they could not-in-fact hide in their shells.
>Though Slipnook reckoned that in this kind of loud, crowded environment, Dehlia certainly wished she could do just that.
>At the very least the Turtle’s face relaxed as she finally saw someone familiar approach her.
>She had dark olive green scales with were juxtaposed by three orange horizontal streaks across her face and small, narrow beak .
>She had a small “overbite” of sorts in which her upper beak hooked downward and over the lower half.
>Her eyes were a cooler, darker yellow, which gave a warm, comforting and inviting look to her face.
>The only clothes she wore was a simple black skirt, for there was nothing immodest on her upper half to cover up.
>She bore no weapon other than a simple wood staff where the wood knotted on the top to form a makeshift club.
>Though Slipnook knew this was no ordinary staff of a traveling peasant, but a dangerous tool of a Druid with great skill.
>“Where is Leela?” Dehlia asks softly as Slipnook sits next to her.
>“She is waiting at the gate for the arrival of our fifth companion. They should be joining us shortly.”
>“Is he really as young as you told me in your letter?” She said, frowning ever so slightly. Her speech was simple, but polite and spoken in an almost courtly manner. “I am not comfortable bringing a child on such a perilless journey.”
>“Did you not read the rest of my letter?” The rat answered back. “His skill is too invaluable for our cause. Leela won’t admit it but she was astonished by what he was able to do.”
>“Even so…” The turtle trailed off and suddenly Slipnook scrunched up his face with a worried look.
>“Where is Anun?” He asked and he was repaid with Dehlia’s own worried look.
>“He hasn’t arrived yet” she began. “I’ve been here two days and haven’t heard anything from him.”
>“That is ill tidings for us” Slipnook replied. “I believe he was traveling through the Wolven Kingdom, it’s possible he could have gotten lost in their forest.”
>“Or worse…” Dehlia muttered.
>“Let’s stay optimistic” Slipnook said reassuringly, pulling a small map out of his sleeve and unrolling it on the table.
>It only displayed a small portion of the Pearlen world; with the Wolven Kingdom being the center of the map.
>The Southwest corner showed only the most northern portion of the Veranian Holdings, leaving the rest to the imagination. Then just slightly north was the village they all agreed to meet at.
>“What do you propose?” Dehlia asked nervously.
>Slipnook’s paw landed straight on the Wolven forests.
>“We travel with safe passage through the Wolven lands up north.”
>Dehlia’s eyes followed Slipnook’s finger as it ran up the map past the forest and through the largely uninhabited plains until it stopped at the large canyon that separated the rest of the world from the Northern lands, which encompassed the Mountainous Northern wastes to the North west, the swamp ridden Black Stench to the North-East, and finally the Foul Curse directly North.
>The Canyon was too wide to be traversable, except only by two natural bridges of rock that connected North and South and was how the Demon Lords of the past moved their armies for conquest and invasion.
>The first land bridge was in the heart of the Black Stench and was too far away to reasonably travel to.
>But the other…
>went straight to the Foul Curse and was directly north of the Wolven Kingdom.
>“…Hopefully we’ll find Anun within the forest and once we regroup with him, we’ll make a straight shot north across the bridge and into the Foul Curse.”
>Dehlia gave the Rat a concerned, skeptical look.
>“But what about that?”
>Her finger places itself on a symbol of a fortress, positioned quite close to the Bridge.
>The ink on the map labeled it as “The Ruined Tower of Beren-Het”, once a watch tower of the Kingdom of Bergon meant to act as a warning beacon for future Demon Lord invasions until it fell to disrepair and ruin.
>That is until the Order of the Trident conquered it and claimed it as their own only a few short years earlier.
>“We’ll be too close to their sphere of influence” Dehlia explained. “I wouldn’t be surprised if they’ve already begun to organize patrols by now.”
>“We have to take the risk” Slipnook argued. “We don’t have the time to travel all the way to the Black Stench.”
>Before the two could continue the debate, a loud commotion was heard at the door of the pub.
>Groups of beasts and men crowded around something or someone.
>A great bellowing could be heard.
>“Where are they! By the Pearl tell me where they are!?”
>As the two stood up a massive figure pushed through the crowd.
>For a man he was tall, well over 6 heads and was more comparable to Leela in height and was much stockier.
>He was barrel chested with thick arms and wrists and wore a tough leather jerkin.
>If he had worn a cloak or carried a sack, he had clearly lost them in his past skirmishes.
> His fists, when clenched resembled hammers more than they did hands, which was fitting because they were his main source of protection and he carried no other weapons. His knuckles and fingers had become thick and calloused over the years.
>His thighs were thick and meaty and his calves and ankles stretched out the fabric of his brown trousers.
>His face resembled a strong brick house: while not exactly ugly it was built for durability and not aesthetic beauty, and his bald head only added to his “unique” look.
>His clothes were torn. Slipnook and Dehlia could see the slashes across his abdomen from the claws of beast folk.
>Both of his cheeks had small but deep cuts on them, most likely from a dagger.
>“Anun!” Slipnook cried out. “What happened?”
>“We have to leave.” Anun said, short of breath.
>“We have to leave right now!”


>Leela taps her paw on the muddy ground impatiently as the guards beckon the cart through the gates.
>It could have just dropped off the little tot right outside the walls and she could have just grabbed him.
>But no, everything has to take up more of her time.
>Her face curdles as she picks up the acidic smell of piss on the streets.
>Why did she have to be the one to play babysitter?
>As the driver begins to ask the guard where he can lodge his horses for the night, the Wolven finally loses her patience.
>The horses neigh loudly, startled by Leela stomping up to the wagon.
>“Where’s the kid?” she growls out.
>The driver, an older, lankier Wolven, narrows his eyes at her.
>“Who wants to know? Rude She-Bitch.” he croaks out.
>Before the confrontation can escalate any further, a small hooded head sticks his head out of the cover wagon.
>“She is my traveling companion!” Andi hastily said. “She is a friend.”
>“She don’t look like a friend, little Master.” The Driver replied, eyeing the pair of sabers sheathed on either side of her waist.
>Leela quietly simmered at the mention of the word ‘Master’.
>She would make sure Andi understood there would be no one to kiss his hairless ass from here on out.
>“Oh she is!” Andi said reassuringly. His lands with a wet ‘plop’ as his feet hit the ground.
>His clothes this time were at least slightly nicer than what she had seen him in before.
>A dark brown hooded cloak which covered a cream tunic which seemed one size too large for the small boy.
>He didn’t wear trousers, but thick black leggings which acted both as pants and socks as well.
>On his feet were tiny suede leather boots which wrapped neatly around his ankles.
>He carried a knapsack which seemed slightly bulkier than it should have been.
>And of course there was his staff, which would have looked like an ordinary walking stick if not for the diamond bored through the tip.
>“I met her before. I am to journey with her and few more companions” Andi said.
>Leela cringed at the thought that this child was to her so called “companion”.
>“Well…okay.” The driver replied cautiously, glaring at Leela with venom. “But I’ll be staying the night before heading back to the forest. So come find me if there is any foul business!”
>“Thank you for looking after me!” Andi said cheerfully as he bowed before the driver, eliciting an eye roll from Leela. “Please have a safe journey home!”
>“And you as well, little Master.”
>“Come on, hurry up” Leela snarled. “The others are waiting for us!”
>Andi gave one last wave to the driver before quickly running to the Wolven’s side, his hood falling back and revealing his golden locks of blond hair that had grown since she had last seen him.
>Combined with his soft features and pale skin, he displayed a more girlish appearance.
>It was a strange juxtaposition next to the towering, intimidating wolven, whom at Andi’s current height only reached her abdomen.
>The Patriarch was right, he was quite short for his size.
>At least Slipnook reached up to her chest.
>14? He easily looked no more than 10 years old at certain angles.
>“What did you pack?” She asked gruffly, noting the bag’s odd shape.
>“Oh, everything I was instructed to.” Andi said nervously.
>“But I also brought a small mandolin as well…” he added.
>“Ha!” Leela laughed but it was only to ease her aggravation.
>“Expecting one of us to play for you like one of your courtly entertainers?”
>“I know how to play…or at least strum” Andi said quietly. “I thought we could use some music over a campfire.”
>A loud ‘hmmpf’ was all that Leela responded with.
>What an idyllic little image of traveling his naive mind had conjured up.
>Nothing of the hours one would have to spend awake in the middle of the night on watch.
>Or the stench of caught game being butchered over a fire.
>Everyone was just supposed to sit back in awe as the noble boy plucked away on his fancy lute.
>How often had the Wolven servants of that wooden castle humored the little tot when he came up to them, taking them away from their duties to waste their time with such inane droll?
>Only for their masters to prattle on about their slow pace.
>How many times did they have to pretend to care about this brat’s whims at the expense of their own children? 
>“Do you know how to play?” He asks, suddenly excited. “Could you teach me any songs?”
>“No.” she replied dryly. Interpreting the boy’s eagerness simply as never had being denied anything in his short life.
>Well she would give him a reality check. Not even some high and mighty blue blood spawn would get everything they wanted.
>And every time when she was a pup she would see the same reaction from these children: tantrums galore.
>A denial of a sweet here, the insistence of a bed time there and they would spiral into a rage that only the most indignantly privilege could possess.
>And even then their poor servants still had to handle them with ‘gentleness and understanding’. Else risk the wrath of their lords.
>Every once in a while though, a Duke or Baron with some sense would see their own children act in such an un-lordly manner and give them a right smack across the face. Cowing their shrill screams into bitter whimpers.
>Though she felt a tinge of shame at the thought, she was pining for this one beside her now to do such a thing.
>If only to remind him that here, he was a Lord of no one.
>“I could teach you, if you like.”
>“W-what?!” the Wolven cried out, taken aback.
>“It has the same number of strings like any other lute!” Andi continued eagerly, his blond hair swaying against his face. “It just sounds a bit different so it throws a lot of people off at first. It took me awhile to get used to it-
>“I-It’s fine. I have no interest in such things.”
>On one hand, she finally got him to stay quiet.
>One the other, she just felt his energy plummet as he simply stared down at the ground.
>Damming Pearl! Why did he have to go and make her feel bad!
>“Hide your staff under your cloak.” She chastised him hastily, trying to change the subject. “You don’t want to go showing that diamond around.” 
>“I’m sorry” he said, though not in regard to his staff. “Have I done anything wrong?”
>“Nothing that you can control” Leela replied gruffly. “When was the last time you slept in a bed?”
>“I left Oakenhowler about a week ago I think.”
>“Very well.” Leela said, feeling tired herself all of a sudden. “Tonight we sleep in beds so we wake up refreshed. But we’ll be sleeping on the hard ground for some time afterwards, so no complaining.”
>“Yes Ma’am.” The boy replied politely.
>Too politely for a Noble, Leela thought-
>Suddenly she spots Slipnook waving frantically over to her.
>Behind him is Dehlia tending to…
>“By the Pearl! Anun!”
>She sprints over to them as Andi struggles to keep up with her long, muscular legs.
>Her normally stationary tail begins to jitter slightly as she looks over the Man, particularly the gashes on his abdomen.
>“It’s just a slight sting” Anun reassured. “It looks worse than it is.”
>“Leela!” Slipnook said urgently, interrupting their reunion. “Do you have Andi?”
>“Here I am!” The boy said cheerfully at the sight of the Rat.
>“Good. We are all accounted for. We must leave now.”
>“No bedding tonight?” Andi said, frowning.
>“I’m afraid not.” Slipnook replied. “We need to reach the safety of the Wolven forest as quickly as possible.”
>“Back towards home?” Andi’s frown morphed into a more puzzled look. “Wouldn’t it have been less trouble if I waited for you at the forest’s edge than come all the way out here?”
>“As considerate as that is of you.” Slipnook said, patting the boy on the shoulder. “Due to recent events I’m glad you’re with us now.”
>“Oh…” The boy said, turning away. Prompting Slipnook to raise his brow.
>Wait. Was he beginning to blush?!
>“Anun should be fine to journey now.” Dehlia said as she applied a thin, green ointment to Anun’s cuts.
>“Good” Slipnook said as he instinctively reached behind him for the hilt of his longsword.
>“Anun, you’ll have to carry Andi. He won’t be able to keep up with us. Leela, I’ll need you in the front with me on scent detail.”
>“Why the quick flight? What happened?” Leela asked.
>“We’re being hunted by the Trident. They were tracking Anun.” Slipnook answered.
>“Who are the Trident?” Andi asked.
>“No time!” Slipnook said, the urgency and impatience in his otherwise calm voice unnerved Andi. “We must make for the forest as soon as possible.”
>Anun took a knee in front the child. If Andi felt intimidated by the man’s blunt physique it was quickly diminished by his warm smile.
>“Do you have a sling for your staff?” He asked. “I’ll need you to put your arms around my neck.”
>“Y-yeah” Andi said as he hastily tied the leather strap around the thick wood.
>“Well come on then, I know you’re probably too old for piggy-back rides.”
>“What’s a piggy-back ride?”
>Dehlia couldn’t help by let out a small giggle at Anun’s look of astonishment.
>Nobles really are sheltered, she thought.
>“Just…just climb on my back and keep your arms around me.”
>Now it was Anun’s turn to blush as he stood up. Dehlia chuckling at the two.
>“He looks good on you” She said, “A bit too big though.”
>“Sorry…” Andi muttered, feeling just as awkward as Anun.
>“Next time you should try sitting on his shoulders” Dehlia teased.
>“I think not!” The two replied.
>“Stop dawdling.” Slipnook said as he and Leela began heading towards the gate. “You three can joke when we’re out of harms way.”
>The trio, with the sudden disposition of naughty children being scolded, quickly fell in line behind the Rat and the the Wolf.





Chapter Five

>“There were thirty on my trail.” Anun explained as the group continued to jog towards the Wolven borders. “I didn’t think they would be so rash as to continue their pursuit once I reached the forest.”
>“They didn’t run into any patrols?” Leela asked, perplex that her own people could be so lax in the Kingdom’s defense.
>“Eventually they did, that’s how I managed to lose them. Whether they were all dealt with or some live I do not know.”
>“It is better to stay safe and be cautious” Slipnook added. He was easily the fastest of the group on account of his small, nimbler size. The small pitter-patters of his bare paws contrasted with the others relatively loud stomps. “Andi, how are you doing?”
>“Uh-uh-uh I’m, f-fine sir!” The boy stuttered out. Hanging onto Anun’s back while the bulky man ran made speech difficult for Andi.
>“We should make it to the forest’s edge right after the Sun sets” Slipnook said sympathetically, sensing the boy’s discomfort. “We’ll stop to rest then.”
>Leela rolled her eyes at the Rat. Stopping to rest for the one who was literally riding on one of his companion’s backs was ridiculous.
>She would have to convince them to keep going until they reached the center of the forest, where they would find real safety.
>“Keep running…” Leela said. “But I smell something.”
>“What?” Slipnook muttered quietly.
>“A couple weeks worth of sweat and grime packed into skin and greasy fur.”
>“That could be any traveller in the distance” Slipnook replied.
>“The scent is faint…because they’ve caked their bodies with dirt and mud.”
>“…to try and cover up their smell.”
>“Yes” Leela answered. “I can’t tell how far they are, but they’re on our right, I’m guessing on the other side of that hill.” 
>“Ah!” Andi cried out, “There’s something up in the sky!”
>“Arrow Volleys!” Anun shouted as he quickly sidestepped.
>Andi felt his breath leave him as the arrow sliced the air downward besides him before piercing the ground below harmlessly.
>“Don’t let go!” Anun said.
>“I won’t” Andi manage to say, too terrified to cry.
>Slipnook darts to the left and the rest follow him, hoping to get out of range of the arrows.
>“I can’t see them” Dehlia shouts.
>“Don’t try to look for them!” Slipnook yells, “Just run.”
>The group follows Slipnook who sprints ahead, showcasing just how fast the little Rat could run.
>The mimic his zig-zagging patterns as the arrows manage to just barely miss them.
>Then as they were just out of their range, there is a sudden THUD as Dehlia lets out a loud yelp.
>There in the distance on a small rock formation stood three new archers.
>And this time they weren’t firing volleys, but direct shots.
>Slipnook’s eyes widened.
>They were waiting for them. It was an ambush.
>“Dehlia!” Leela cried out. “Are you hurt.”
>“It pierced my shell.” The Turtle gasps out, more from the breath getting knocked out of her than actual pain. “I’m fine.”
>“We sprint straight ahead to the forest” Slipnook says.
>“There are more waiting” Leela protests. “I can smell them.”
>“Then we cut them down if they get in our way.” The rat said defiantly, unsheathing his longsword and gripping it with both paws. “Any other direction and we’ll get shot down. We need the safety of the trees.”
>They all hear the distant ‘thwang!’ as the bowmen on the rocks let loose more arrows.
>Andi can feel the familiar tingle crawl over his skin as he senses the presence of magic.
>But for the first time it wasn’t from himself.
>The knot at the tip of Dehlia’s staff glows green as a large, chunky wall of mud shoots up just before her feet.
>A wet sound is heard as the arrows strike and then are suctioned into the slick, brown mud.
>And just as it was summoned, it collapses in a heap, painting the party’s boots and feet with splotches of mud.
>“I won’t be able to keep this up!” Dehlia cried out.
>“Run!” Slipnook shouted, “Run or we all die!”
>Andi’s body begins to ache with small shots of pain as his ribs bounce around from Anun’s ungraceful sprinting.
>The group bolts towards the forest, the tips of the forest was beginning to appear on the horizon.
>It was still at least a couple of miles ahead.
>Slipnook didn’t know if they had the energy to keep running like this for that long.
>But they would have to else they would be skewered by arrows.
>All of the lands in and around the Veranian holdings were plains with a few small hills, there wasn’t much to use as cover and maybe try fighting it out.
>“I smell them ahead of us” Leela panted out. “But I don’t see anything.”
>“How many?” Slipnook asked.
>“A lot” was the answer. “More than eight at least.”
>Slipnook eyes narrows, his vision superior to that of his companion.
>“There’s a single man ahead. In a blue cloak.”
>Soon enough Leela saw the figure as well.
>“But I can smell beast as well” she said as she drew her sabers.
>“They’re so close I can smell them too.” Slipnook added as his grip over his longsword tightened.
>Where were they?
>Then he saw it.
>The patches of brown amongst all the green grass.
>His black eyes widen in shock and terror as the dirt began to shift.
>His talon like claws dig into the ground and rips the grass as he begins to skid to a stop.
>His mouth was too slow for his reflexes, only screaming out “Ambush!” after he plunged his sword into one of the dirt patches. A foul, curdled scream came forth as a hand with a spear ripped through the thin layer of dirt.
>The man’s eyes rolled back, surprised to find a sword thrust into his shoulder. Slipnook could smell the urine as the man fell back into the pit releasing the last of his bowels before he expired.
>Slipnook turned around as he watched more assailants burst from the dirt with weapons in hand.
>Counting the one Slipnook had just slayed, there were eight
>A beast-kin, a sinewy mouse with large wide ears was quick enough to get a strike upon Leela. But his thrust with his long-knife was flimsy and the large wolven parried it easily with just one saber. The mouse cries out as she makes a deep slash into his belly.
>Slipnook couldn’t help but wince as she leaned forward with her maw wide open and snapped down upon the mouse’s face.
>He always hated it when she did that.
>Another beast-folk, this time a wolven, with brown fur and was leaner and more sinewy than Leela, manage to strike Dehlia from behind with a hatchet. Hitting the shell for a second time now.
>However his swing was clumsy and he struck at an angle, resulting in the hatchet merely glancing off the shell with only a semi-deep nick.
>As the Turtle swung around the knot of her staff cracks into the wolven’s skulls. Causing blood to immediately pour down the wolven’s matted fur.
>With the butt end of her staff she thrusts into the wolven’s throat. The beast drops his weapon and his eyes begin to bulge as he chokes and sputters.
>He loses his balance as he falls back into the pit.
>Dehlia’s staff glow green once more as the wolven falls deeper into the pit than he originally dug.
>The dirt moves on its own as it quickly fills up the hole. Blocking the noise of bone being crushed as it was sifted underneath many layers of deep earth.
>Slipnook only saw a blur from Anun as his assailant, a masked human, was dispatched with a single punch to what Slipnook guessed was the jaw.
>Blood and teeth spilled out from beneath the cloth mask as the man simply crumpled over and presumably died.
>Slipnook knew Anun wasn’t one to spare attackers by merely knocking them out.
>Andi’s grip as he holds onto Anun his tight. So tight his finger tips starting trickling out small droplets of blood.
>His eyes were squeezed tight as he buried his face against Anun’s shoulder. Trying to block out all the sound and noise of the carnage.
>In that meek display, Slipnook considered whether or not he had made a bad decision bringing him along.
>Maybe Leela was right.
>All of the others had lived hard lives, seeing death and killing well before they were Andi’s age.
>Maybe he had forgotten that that wasn’t exactly a normal occurrence for him.
>Leela did have a point about him being a Noble- as much as he thought she exaggerated it due to her bias.
>Andi was softer than all of them, and not just from his age, but from his upbringing.
>Slipnook knew it was a gamble bringing him along, and in that moment he was pretty stunned with himself with how quickly he was willing to make that gamble.
>Especially considering it wasn’t his life in question.
>In fact how did the boy feel about doing this?
>Did anyone ask him?
>Did he go of his own free will?
>Slipnook never got the chance to pry into such questions, with how tightfisted the Patriarch had been.
>That old man had taken a gamble as well.
>Which Slipnook found even more disturbing than his own-
>“Dehlia!” Leela howled out, smashing the rat back to the reality of now.
>“Bury the others before they get out!”
>It was too late for that, however. As her staff glowed green, three of the remaining four had managed to scramble out.
>The fourth one was too slow as his leg was caught in the dirt-turned-rapid-quicksand. The man dropped his sword and let out a shrill, mewling cry as he was sucked back under. The joints in his knees and legs bending and twisting in unnatural angles as he was swallowed like a morsel.
>Eight to three, Slipnook thought. Their odds were looking better.
>But not by much, he could hear the thumping boots of the two previous group of bowmen running towards them.
>“You should have stayed out of our affairs.”
>And then there’s this guy.
>Andi opened his eyes at the sound of his voice.
>Something about him seemed…odd.
>And it wasn’t just his obscuring clothing: a large blue cloak that covered his whole body from the neck down.
>Not even his arms, or his feet could be seen.
>Andi thought his face was similar to Anun’s. As if a face had been carved from a hardy stone by a very diligent amateur craftsman. He had a harsh, angular jaw and a nose with a wide bridge.
>His eyes were a dark brown and seemed just slightly too far apart from each other. They gave Andi the mental image of some kind of Lizard.
>Like Andi, Dehlia could sense the ‘aura’ the man gave off.
>“You should have stayed in your tower, Trident scum.” Leela spat out, baring her fangs.
>The man returned her glare with a smile. One that mocked her, one that silently spoke ‘you are nothing to me.’
>And her eye twitch at the thought that a man with seemingly no weapons whom she towered over didn’t give him the slightest pause as he continued walking towards them
>“You are Leela of Highforest, correct?”
>She didn’t answer him.
>“What a shame that you are to die here in some field.”
>“And who are you to threaten us?” Slipnook whistled out.
>Dehlia could feel small vibrations in the ground beneath her.
>But Andi could ‘see’ it.
>A faint, narrow, transparent glow crawled below their feet, deep in the ground. 
>Andi looked around expectantly, wondering why no one was reacting to this spectacle that clearly danced before his eyes.
>“I am Gully” the man answered. 
>Andi watched closely as it inched towards Leela carving itself a path through the hidden dirt underneath.
>“Never heard of you” Leela snarled.
>“I aim to keep it as such.” Gully growled out as a clenched fist shot out of his cloak.
>Then some instinct kicked in, as if something deep and primeval pricked into the center of Andi’s brain.
>He saw this shapeless glow form into a point.
>And it began to thrust upward towards the surface.
>“Leela! Get out of the way!” Andi cried out.
>“What?!” Gully yelled, grinding his teeth in anger.
>A large stone with a sharpened tip burst from the ground beneath Leela.
>Startled first by Andi’s warning then by the rock threatening to skewer her, she fell back and landed on her rear, her tail cushioning her fall.
>Had she stayed put, the stone would have penetrated beneath her muzzle and impaled her skull.
>She had moved just in time for it to only cut her nose.
>“Magic?!” Dehlia said, staring in disbelief at Gully as the stone crumbled as quickly as its master lost his temper.
>“Kill them!” He screamed at his remaining men.
>His cloak flourishes as he stretches his arms out.
>The ground begins to vibrate again, and this time everyone could feel it.
>And Slipnook saw that the bowmen from before had finally caught up to them.
>More sharp stones begin to bore through the earth beneath the group’s feet.
>Any subtlety Gully had used before in casting his magic had been abandoned.
>Dehlia’s staff glowed green as she tried to block the rock with dirt.
>But the stone was stronger and it grinded away Dehlia’s efforts. At best it was only slowed down.
>The three remaining ambushers stood back, preferring to let Gully and the Bowmen finish them off.
>“Slip!” Leela cried out to the Rat. “Kill him quickly before-
>“Too late!” Gully shrieked, veins bulging on the side of his temple. “You all die now!”
>Anun pivots as he feels Andi let go. His small frame falling onto the ground.
>The boy summoned what meager strength he had to ripped his staff away from the leather straps.
>His teeth sinks into his bottom lip, breaking the skin and producing a trickle of blood.
>The diamond in his staff glows as it points at Gully.
>Gully is too stunned at the sight to react as he is struck with a blinding light.
>He falls to his knees as he desperately tries to rub the light from his pupils.
>It felt as if acid had been splashed into his eyes.
>He could hear moans of agony from his cohorts as they suffered a similar blight.
>He forced himself up to his feet and finally had the will to endure the fierce stinging as he pried open his eyelids, the whites of his eyes streaked with red.
>His face became hot and flushed from fury.
>His bloodshot eyes bulged out from the sight before him. Giving him the appearance of a monster.
>Only crumbling stone and writhing Beast-men remained.
>His targets had fled amid the flash.
>He clenched his fists and grinded his teeth.
>The earth rocked and quake amidst his tantrum as he screamed out a frenzied roar.


Chapter Six

>“They’ll be on our tail before long” Dehlia said, breathing heavy. Her last act of magic had left her tired and barely keeping up with the others.
>“We need to get to the Forest!” Leela added in. “Where are you taking us?”
>“We wouldn’t get there in time” Slipnook explained. “I know this region well. There is a dried out river bed we can hide in.”
>“That won’t-
>“Leela” Slipnook coughed out amid his panting.
>His body was built for short sprints, running for longer periods of time made his chest heave, and his feet and ankles ache.
>“Just trust me.” He pleads, only getting a quiet ‘hmmpf’ in reply from the wolven.
>“Anun” Slipnook said, turning his head towards the towering human. “How is Andi?”
>The Bald man frowned slightly as his eyes gazed down towards the little crumpled up bundle in his arms.
>“He’s out cold.”
>Slipnook could only return the frown as he darted his heads back towards the river bed, which was just coming into view.
>That boy’s stamina really was poor. One decent spell and he was helpless.
>But that one decent spell had just saved them all.
>A fair trade-off, Slipnook thought.
>“Come. Into the River bed” Slipnook said as he jumped down.
>It had only dried out less than two years prior. There was still leftover sediment from the water’s current and the ground here still felt slightly spongy.
>The River hadn’t been very wide, but it was deep. From the Riverbed to the surface was more than double Leela’s height.
>“This isn’t a good hiding place” Leela protested again.
>“I must agree” Anun said as Andi rustled slightly in his arms “If the Trident catches us here we’ll be trapped.”
>“Dehlia” Slipnook said, ignoring the others. “Can you still cast?”
>“I’m beginning to reach my limit” She explained, her hands trembling as she weakly held her staff. “I’ve been covering our tracks as well…”
>“I need you for one final spell, dear” Slipnook said sympathetically. “Then we can all rest.”
>They all look at the Rat inquisitively as he places his paw against the river bed wall.
>Still slightly damp, the moisture hadn’t completely evaporated yet.
>Perfect.
>“Carve some hidey-holes for us. We’ll cover the entrances and wait them out.”
>“What?!” Leela said, indignant. “I’m supposed to live in the dirt like some Mole!”
>“You lived in burrows when you were a pup” Slipnook said, not caring if he embarrassed her. “We both know it’s not that bad.”
>Leela bared her teeth at his comment, but before she could snap her maw at him they heard the dirt crumbling away.
>Dehlia’s staff glowed a dull, faded green as she gripped it tightly with two hands. Her body shook and her shell rattled from the strain.
>Two little entrances form from the river wall as Dehlia carved makeshift tunnels into the earth.
>Her beak clicks as her knees quickly slam onto the ground.
>“Dehlia!” Anun cries out as he runs to her, Andi’s head bobbing slightly against his bicep
>“I think I’m going to be sick…” she gasped out as she let out a gurgling dry heave.
>“Here” Leela says as she moves past Slipnook, giving the Rat one final glare and pushing his shoulder aside as she reached for her flask.
>“Drink” the wolven commands sternly as she pops the cork off the leather-sack and pours a small stream of water into Dehlia’s beak, too weak to hold it herself.
>She drinks greedily, choosing momentarily not to breathe in favor of more water gushing down her dried throat.
>She finally gasps for air, coughing and sputtered out spittle.
>Leela helps the fatigued turtle stagger to her feet as she gestures towards the two makeshift shelters.
>“I could only make two.” She says with a tired, monotonous voice. “We’ll have to all squeeze in.”
>“Will we fit?” Leela asked.
>“At the end of the tunnel there should be a little round clearing. Should work.”
>“And it’s stable?”
>“ Probably. I don’t really care right now.”
>Not exactly inspiring confidence, Leela thought. Though then again it wasn’t like they had much of a choice.
>“Leela and I will take the burrow on the right.” Slipnook said, finally sheathing his blade. “Anun, can I trust you to take care of those two for now?”
>“Of course” Anun nodded as he slung Andi over one shoulder and with his other hand gently guided Dehlia within the depths of the tunnel. With a flicker of green from her staff, the dirt collapsed around the entrance, obscuring them completely.
>Leela spun around to face the Rat, her eyes glaring at him.
>“If you got something to say, say it while we still have daylight.” Slipnook said, getting right to the point.
>“You think you’re so smug. Bringing up my poverty in front of others” She sneered meanly.
>“The Burrow? No one cares Lee-
>“I care!” She hissed, her low husky voice raising to a high pitched shriek as she struggled to control herself.
>For once Slipnook was taken aback as the Wolven’s shoulders began to shake.
>“You think that just because you can shrug off the wretched hovel you lived in that everyone else can?”
>“Leela…”
>“Eight brothers and sisters living in a hole in the ground like feral vermin! Am I too weak for you because I can’t laugh it off!”
>“Leela, stop this.”
>“And then you go and so casually spout that off like it’s just some thing that happened! In front of them no less!    
>Slipnook reaches out and grabs her paw.
>She tries to pull back but the Rat’s grip is strong.
>“Leela!” He cries out out.
>“You pretend to be so friendly to everyone” she snaps, her cheeks wet. “But then you turn around and act like a real bastard!”
>He reaches his paws up and cups her chin, bringing the two’s snouts together as their noses both touch.
>He stares in her eyes, they were like sharp jagged pieces of ice that reflected a deep blue ocean.
>They were often fierce, even unfeeling and hard due to their profession necessitating killing.
>Oh who was he kidding, they had both killed when they were barely juveniles.
>But in this moment, all he saw was the frightened, impotent rage of a pup.
>A pup that he knew had lived a hard life.
>“I’m sorry, Leela” he muttered as his nose rubbed affectionately against hers.
>“I’m careless with what I say. I never meant…”
>He doesn’t finish as Leela draws him in for a hug. Her tongue affectionately licking the top of his head.
>“You really are careless” Leela says slowly as she pulls away from him. “You need to more conscious of your words. It’s why you don’t have a house anymore.”
>“Are you gonna tease me for my living standards now?” Slipnook let out a chuckle.
>“I really shouldn’t” she replied, staring at the dark hole before them. “We both face a steep decline in our abodes now.”
>“Before” Slipnook said carefully, stepping towards the entrance “it was eight brothers and sisters. Now it’s just us.”
>Leela stared at the rat, his black tail swishing ever so slightly back and forth, beckoning her almost.
>“Like I said, it won’t be that bad.”
>The wolven smiled.
>“No, I guess not.”


>“Sire” The Fox spoke, his eyes seemed to glow in the night or maybe just reflected off the sheen of the moon.
>“We can’t find any trace of them” He continued. “We’ve spotted no tracks.”
>Gully, despite his earlier outburst at his prey’s escape, remained stoic at this continued bad news.
>“The Turtle-kin is a Druid. Some priestess of the Southern Swamplands I reckon. She was probably filling up their footprints with soil.”
>“The winds have picked up as well.” The Fox further explained. “We know they fled north but other than that we’ve lost their scent.”
>“They were too fatigued and rattled to try to continue towards the forest” Gully replied, grinning. “They know these lands better than we do. They certainly just found a good hiding spot.”
>“This land is relatively flat with only a few hills and trees, Sire.” The fox said. “If we spread out we can-
>“Don’t bother” Gully said sternly and his hands fumbled for something under his cloak. “The others need rest. We will position ourselves close to where the Wolven Kingdom and the Mountains meet. We will catch them there.”
>“Near the Scabbed Mountains?” The fox asked.
>Gully nodded quietly as his hand revealed itself holding two blue stones.
>The stones had two identical runes carved into the rock, then it looked like a small stream of molten gold had flowed into the crevices and allowed to cool and harden.
>The Fox stepped back, wary of what his master held.
>“Is that-
>“I suggest you and the others keep your distance in the future. I now know we are dealing with two mages.”
>“And one of them is very dangerous.”


It creaks. That’s something no one ever mentions. How even that thick, powerful oak ages over time. The fibers in the wood weakens under your footsteps and squeals. It is not your friend. Even in the coldness of the dark it let’s everyone know where Andi is exactly. Every step feels awkward and clumsy.

“There he is!” says the wood “There is Andioch of Okaenhowler! He’s right here! You don’t care he’s there! But in case you do, right there! Right there do you see! Do you see!”

It’s shrieks are painful to all who hear it. Like shattered glass scratching against the skull. And no one looks at the wood with disdain for its outburst. It’s just wood after all, it can’t help itself.

Large glowing eyes center on Andi who crouches down to cover his head. He can help himself! Why can’t he stay still? Why must he cause the wood such discomfort? Why is his presence so small yet so painful? He’s like a tiny insect whose bite always irritates but not much more.

“please.” he says, his head between his knees. “please don’t look at me like that.”

He is in his room. No noise to be made here, no eyes to make his knees buckles. There is no one outside this room. There is nothing outside this room. The window is painted black. On a table there is one candle, long with brown wax. Next to it are four tomes, the one on top is made from a red scaled leather. There is a lock on the front, old and rusty. The key is in the drawer, only for Andi to open. Unique to him. Special to him. 
Special. He is special. The Eyes say different. The Eyes are…

There is a creak, outside his door. A quiet trail of creaks moving like a slow stream towards his room. Finally! It can be someone else who the wood betrays, someone else who eyes show contempt towards. It doesn’t have to be him! It doesn’t have to be him anymore! 

He perks his ears. Who is it? He wonders. who is coming to my door?

The creak says nothing. It suddenly just becomes wood for silly, stupid boys to prattle about. That’s when the truth is revealed: The Oak is malicious and will only target him. It is a conspiracy, between the Eyes and the Oak.

The creak glides from the floor to the door as it slowly begins to open. The candle dies. 


>“Andi?” A voice called out in the dark. The ground he laid on felt damp and cool.
>“Andi are you alright?” It said again.
>“Who’s there?!” He replied, slightly panicking. He had woken up, seemingly escaping the darkness of his dream only for it to seemingly follow it from the confines of his wild imagination.
>“It’s Dehlia, Andi, are you alright? You were muttering in your sleep.”
>“Sorry” he said reflexively. He couldn’t see it, but his response prompted a concerned frown from the Turtle.
>“I’m sorry” he repeated again, his voice now raised just a pinch higher. “Can we get a light please?”
>Dehlia sensed his tone was becoming more jittery, she could hear his fingers anxiously sliding across the dirt. As if trying to grab fruitlessly onto anything for safety.
>“Our candlewick just burnt out, Anun is getting a new one.”
>The way she emphasized the man’s named made it clear he was being too slow.
>Andi’s ears then picked up the sound of clumsy hands blindly ruffling through a bag.
>“I can’t find it” Anun grumbled from the depths of the darkness. “Your pack is too cluttered with stuff. Can’t you just light your staff?”
>“And risk passing out? I’m wringed out enough as is“ Dehlia sighed. “Here just toss it to me. I’ll find it.”
>“Oh. I can make a light!” Andi said, trying to fumble his arms around for his own staff.
>“No” Dehlia said firmly. “You’re worse for wear than I am.”
>That stung Andi. Was he really that fragile? He had seen Dehlia cast magic close to a dozen times, all of which were feats that to someone as naive as himself seemed beyond impossible.
>What did he do in comparison? A simple flash of light?
>And afterwards someone had to carry him to safety in the middle of a battle.
>Why was he here, if he really was that pathetic?
>Why did Slipnook want him in the first place?
>Even in what made him special, in what made him unique. He was outclassed in every way.
>Andi’s eyes blink and water as a spark crackles and finds its way to the wick of a fresh candle. Its base placed firmly in the soft dirt.
>The Orange streaks in her face gleamed warmly against the flickering candle.
>To Andi they looked like a dash of paint had been brushed lightly against her dark green scales to give her a dash of a more vibrant color.
>Her eyes were yellow with black pupils similar to that of a human, instead of the slits of felines or other reptile-kin Andi had heard of.
>And unlike the yellow eyes of a cat, which were often a bright yellow like that of the sun. This was a darker yellow, one whose lack of luminance proved to be inviting and friendly. Where the opposite would have been overwhelming and even intimidating.
>Dehlia on her end finally had an opportunity to take a good look at the boy.
>He was a cutie with his tiny frame. His face was a mixture of strong and weak qualities, at least according to human standards.
>His Jaw had a deep angular cut to it. But his cheeks were sunken in. Not enough to look malnourished, but enough to be noticeable. 
>The bridge of his nose was straight without any dents that some had, and his nostrils luckily didn’t protrude from the sides. The tip was rounded but not so much as to appear bulbous. 
>His lips however seemed like small pink wisps to Dehlia. His mouth itself wasn’t small, but the thin lips added a most feminine quality to his face.
>She couldn’t help but let out a small smile at him. He looked far younger than he actually was. She didn’t see rashness or infuriating impatience that was associated with a boy his age. But rather the nervousness and anxiety that younger and particularly shy children felt when they saw something they didn’t understand.
>His eyes only added to that quality. A deep, dark green that seemed even less colorful than her own dulled scales.
>They reminded her of an uncut gem that still needed to be refined before it could grace the world.
>It was a similar sentiment she felt towards the boy in general.
>He would grow into a fine man.
>Though she couldn’t say she felt comfortable with the ‘refinement’ in question being their assignment.
>“Oh!” Dehlia exclaimed, “this is the first time we’ve properly met.” She frowns as she looks around at the literal hole in the ground they were in. “Definitely would have preferred the inn.”
>“Where are we?” Andi asks.
>“A tunnel I quickly made by the side of a dried up river” was the answer. “Leela and Slipnook are in a second one next door.”
>“Will we…be safe?” Andi asked warily.
>“We should, at least for the rest of the night.” Dehlia replied. “We’ll have to hope the Trident moves on tomorrow and we continue without incident.”
>“Who are they?”
>Dehlia holds up a finger to Andi, she turns her head towards Anun.
>“My shell is starting to feel a little irritating” She complained. “Can you take a look?”
>Anun’s eyes widened as he slammed his palm into his face.
>“The Arrow from before is still stuck” he grumbled. “I’ll yank it out.”
>“Be gentle!” She said, alarmed by his usage of the work ‘yank’. “Make sure the arrowhead doesn’t get stuck.”
>She motions to her pack.
>“There is a green salve in there. Same one I applied to your cuts. Fill the crack with it and it’ll heal by tomorrow.”
>“Doesn’t that hurt?” Andi said as Anun began to rummage through the bag.
>“Not really” Dehlia replied with a shrug. “It can itch after awhile if it’s not properly taken care of. But there’s no pai--Ah!”
>She lets out a small yelp as Anun, in one rapid motion, jerked the arrow out.
>“I said gently you brute!” she huffs out.
>“Sorry” Anun says plainly as he tosses the arrow to the side. “Lie on your stomach while I apply the salve.”
>She complies as she stretches out along the dirt. Andi can hear her joints and ligaments pop and crack.
>“You’re…um, Dehlia, correct?” Andi says nervously, “and you’re Anun.”
>Anun only nods quietly as he lathers his hands with the salve and begins to rub it into the shell.
>Dehlia tilts her head upward at the boy and smiles.
>“Mhhmm, and you’re Andioch of Oakenhowler. Slipnook wrote many letters to me about you.”
>“Did he really?” Andi said excitedly. Stunned by the notion of anyone talking about him at all.
>“You’re an interesting person, Andi. Most don’t have your talents.”
>“I’m not that special…” he replied, rubbing his face. “I can barely cast a single spell. You’re the amazing one. I couldn’t do anything like that.”
>Dehlia was silent for a moment.
>He seemed like a nice boy back in town.
>But she never met a noble that humble, let alone a noble child.
>“You’re…you’re a Druid, right?” Andi asked apprehensively.
>Dehlia nodded. She saw his eyes look down on the ground and his hands gripping his wrists.
>He really was an astoundingly nervous boy.
>“I was tutored by my parents and the elders of my tribe” Dehlia explained.
>“But that’s reserved only for children of Chieftains” Andi continued. “So you must be a Princess of sorts, right?”
>Dehlia laughs, her shell shakes slightly, prompting some droplets of the salve to splatter on Anun’s face.
>“I guess. But there really aren’t any Princesses where I’m from. Your concept of nobility is very foreign to my people.”
>“I find it very confusing as well.” Andi said, finally having the courage to hint at a smile.
>Dehlia lets out a small giggle, “how’s that? Aren’t you a noble yourself?”
>She immediately regrets her question as that fragile smirk quickly breaks.
>“I guess…” was Andi’s only mumbled reply.
>Anun pauses as Dehlia turns to look at him, giving the man a bewildered look.
>What did Slipnook really know about this boy when he wrote those letters?
>Not much apparently. This boy who apparently was raised in privilege and prestige certainly didn’t act like it.
>The very mention of it seemed to make him pull away and withdraw. 
>Coincidentally it reminded Dehlia of a Turtle.
>Slipnook did mention Andi’s real parents had died when he was very young.
>Oh…
>That might explain it.
>She turns back to Andi, giving him another smile to warm him back up to her.
>“Is that why you’re acting so shy around me?” Dehlia teased, genially changing the topic. “You thought I was a Princess and was trying to be polite?”
>“I don’t know how proper I can be sleeping in a hole in the ground” Andi teased back, returning the playful tone.
>The three of them all chuckle at the reality of their makeshift shelter.
>“Actually” Andi starts. “It’s because you…um, use magic.”
>Under the dim crackle of the candlelight, Dehlia could see the flush begin to form around his cheeks.
>“Other than tutors and such, I’ve never met someone who was…like me.”
>Anun shoots Andi a pitying look.
>There was such a sense of loneliness in his tone.
>After all, what other human would he be able to relate to?
>Especially if Slipnook was right and they had him holed up in the depths of that castle.
>“Well I’m no tutor” Dehlia replies warmly. “We are each others peers.”
>“Peers?”
>“We can learn from each other” Dehlia explained. “But neither is the master over the other.”
>“I don’t think you can learn much from me…” Andi said. “I’m not very skilled.”
>Dehlia blinks, stunned at the ignorance of his own abilities.
>“You were skilled enough to save all of us!” she exclaimed, startling the other two.
>Andi practically jumped from her outburst.
>That magic he had casted before was not some cheap trick or a basic flash spell which required more knowledge about the position of the sun than actual sagely skill.
>That was a blast of light magic. The kind that burns the eyes and bleaches the skin.
>Just a bit stronger and Andi could have seriously risked blinding someone.
>It was the first time she had witness such magic, maybe the first time that anyone had witnessed it outside the Rams secretive lands for generations.
>For it was their magic.
>The magic of the Pearl.  
>“We might have all died right then and there if not for you” Dehlia explained. “I don’t know if Slipnook would have reached that caster in time.”
>Andi looked down, unable to speak.
>His pale face was completely beet red.
>He was very easy to get flustered, Dehlia was starting to realize.
>“That man…it wasn’t a trick. I could tell.” Andi began slowly. Prompting Dehlia to tilt her head slightly.
>“That was magic. He’s like me.”
>“Indeed” she said solemnly. “It’s quite the accomplishment that there is a second human capable of magic that no one knew about. Slipnook and Leela at least heard rumors of you.”
>Anun leans off of Dehlia’s shell as he smears the last of of salve. He scoots back towards her bag to find the water sack to wash his hands.
>“Though the Trident have always been good at keeping secrets” Dehlia continued, not bothering to hide the disdain in her voice.
>“Who are they?” Andi asks again.
>Dehlia sits back up and crosses her legs. Shortly afterward she is joined by Anun, wiping his hands with a rag and holding a small back in his hands.
>As the three of them scoot closer to the singular candle lighting the otherwise pitch black hole, Anun tosses the bag on the ground. Revealing the small purple berries within.
>“Eat up. It’s not much but it’s our dinner for the evening.”
>Andi, despite his previous shyness, greedily grabs a handful of the fruit and wastes no time popping them insatiably into his mouth.
>The others follow suit and quickly half the bag is already empty.
>“Many years ago” Anun began, his ominous voice not matching the stains of berries smeared across his lips. “The Kings of Bergon were advised by wise sages. Considered to be unmatched in their knowledge of those things beyond our grasps. The ones of olden days during the Great Sundering were said to be able to lift mountains and drain seas.”
>The candle flickered as hot wax dribbled down and mixed itself in with the speckles of cool dirt.
>“But they grew arrogant in their power and began preaching against the Pearlen God. They clashed with their King and Lord and soon saw themselves as more worthy to rule. Decades ago they broke their oath and slew the Bergonite King. With their followers by their side and an army amassed they would call themselves the Order of the Trident.”
>“Do they worship the Crimson Deity?” Andi asked, and Anun quickly shook his head.
>“No one knows who they serve or what their purpose is. Their contempt for the wider world is well known. As if they are the only ones ‘enlightened’ and no one else is worthy of their vision. Even the origins of their very name is a mystery.”
>“What happened? After they killed the King?”
>“Loyalists caught the Trident’s army in a trap and massacred the lot of them. Driving them away from the Kingdom. The surviving sages and their entourage roamed the wilderness as bandits. Taking part in strange, unnatural rituals and desecrating the lands they dwelt in.”
>Anun pauses in his explanation and reaches down for more berries.
>“What do they want with us?” Andi asked, wiping his face.
>“Up in the north” Anun answered between munches, “By the Canyon and close to the Foul Curse is an abandoned tower the Bergonites once manned to keep watch over Demon Lords of the past. Only a short time ago did the Trident take it for themselves. They’ve used their new proximity to ally with Demon Lord Kolonus. We seek to kill Kolonus, they seek to kill us.”
>Anun receives a small nudge in the ribs from Dehlia from that last sentence.
>Which really only puzzled the man. Boy or no, he should be aware of the risks of this assignment.
>“I’m sorry…” Andi said to the two as his fingers dug into the dirt. “I wasn’t told most of this. I don’t mean to be ignorant.”
>“What were you told?” Dehlia asked, almost afraid of the answer.
>From what Slipnook had written to her and from what she could gleam from Andi herself, something was wrong.
>Something was really wrong.
>“That I was to help slay a Demon Lord and…um” Andi started, his anxiety and small stutters beginning to come back. “Serve and bring prestige to House Oakenhowler.”
>Dehlia rolled her eyes at that last part.
>At least these Nobles priorities were consistent.
>“Really I was just told to study my books once more and commit them to memory.”
>Dehlia sighs, “well that’s not the worst advice to be given. What texts?”
>She expected a manuscript on Runes. Perhaps the Runic Histories by Sage Hirven
>Certainly with his magical affinities he would have read The Paths of the Light, author unknown.
>She almost choked on her berries when he gave her the actual answer.
>“The Four Scales” and nothing else.
>What?!
>Even she had only read Gadfly the Mercurial.
>That was the only text her people could find.
>And to her, that seemed like the only one worth reading with all its tricks and workarounds.
>One might be able to get something out of Hazel the Forlorn, if they could get past the bad poetry.
>She didn’t even know anything about Maurianna the Golden, other than she slayed Veheram alongside Gadfly.
>And who in their right mind would want to read the insane ramblings of that vile dragon?
>By the Pearl…
>Who gives a child, a child capable of light magic no less, a text by Veheram the Monstrous? Dehlia thought.
>She was even more horrified when he revealed that was the text he read the most.
>“It’s not so bad” Andi explained. “I always had a tutor to help differentiate between the Crimson worship and the more practical advice.”
>That didn’t make it much better.
>In other cities, especially to the East where Dragons are in close proximity, Andi would be hunted down and killed for dedication to such readings.
>How was this boy so meek, so shy, and anxious all the time yet reading such brash and dangerous essays?
>“And you could understand it?” Dehlia asked. “Most wouldn’t be able to make sense of those books.”
>“Yeah…”Andi said, clearly not really understanding the gravity of this conversation, heck of his whole upbringing.
>“It was tough at first, and the tutors were really hard on me. But I…I dunno I just got it. It’s like when you’re first being taught to read and you struggle with all the words and letters. Then some day you just catch yourself reading and you don’t even realize it.”
>Dehlia nodded slowly, astonished as she was concerned.
>No basic theory, no breath control, probably no runic training either.
>They were all Human after all, his family. They had no experience with magic or what it could do outside of second-hand experiences.
>But to just throw some of the most erudite, convoluted, and frankly dangerous practical theories of magical arts at a small boy was ignorance at an astounding level.
>Did no one in Oakenhowler stop and think about this?
>Those so called “tutors” were probably nothing more than beast-folk hired out of some university to do a job without any questions of complaints.
>Like a whore.
>“Is something wrong?” Andi asked, noticing the frown forming on the Turtle’s face. “Did I say anything?”
>“No!” Dehlia let out quickly, shaking her head rapidly.
>“But I think your training has been a little…narrow.”
>That was an understatement.
>No wonder he was passing out at every spell. The only magic he was taught was the sort of thing that his body simply wasn’t trained for.
>It was a miracle he hadn’t died from casting exhaustion.
>“I’d like to teach you some things” Dehlia said. “Little things that I’ve learned while on the road.” 
>“I know I still have a lot to learn” Andi said, his eyes drooping low. “I still haven’t committed the Four scales to heart fully.”
>“That’s not what I mean, Andi” Dehlia reach out and grabs his hand.
>His fingers were somehow smaller than even hers.
>“Even the wisest magicians still have much to learn. More than can be learn in a single lifetime of any creature.”
>Andi’s eyes widen from the touch, but he doesn’t pull back from her.
>“There’s more to learning than reading a book. Especially those books” she pressed on but was suddenly tapped on the shoulder by Anun.
>He silently points at their candle, of which half of had already melted away into the soft dirt.
>“Bed time” she whispers. 
>Anun yawns as he scooped up what remained of the berries and began to pack them.
>“You have a blanket in your bag, right Andi?”
>The boy quietly nods as he pulled out a simple black cloth out of his pack. Quickly wrapping it around himself.
>“It’s no bed” Andi admitted. “But at least we’re safe and not exposed to the elements.”
>“Very true. Anun you lost your things when fleeing from the Trident?”
>“Unfortunately, yes” Anun replied.
>“You’ll share my blanket. Andi, is it alright if I blow out the candle.”
>“Yes” he squeaks out as he places his head on the foamy soil. “Goodnight everyone.”
>And just like in his dream the candle went out and it seemed like the darkness would creep into the very etches of his mind.
>But now, as he heard the soft breathing of his companions beside him, he wasn’t afraid.
