>October 31st
>You and the guys are going to the annual “Freak Fair”
>It has everything you could ask for: janky rides, spooky food, a-little-too-into-their-roles street performers
>Girls wearing a third of the coverage as the men even when dressed as the same character
>Some of them don’t look comfortable on this particularly chilly night
>You’re glad you’re wearing such a thick hooded robe, even if it’s an obnoxious blood-red color
>One of your friends convinced everyone else to do a group theme
>Unfortunately, it’s based off some obscure anime he knows
>Halloweeb indeed
>Gotta say, he can pull off the schoolgirl look better than you expected
>But you’re fine with the character assigned to you, even if it means having no clue what to tell strangers you’re supposed to be
>Freak Fair lives up to its name as your group of five passes through the mouth of a massive plaster skull
>Virtually everyone’s in costume, some painstakingly crafted and some obviously cobbled together at the last minute
>The commotion of the crowds is deafening, thanks in part to several screamer bands and their unintelligible lyrics 
>So you’re glad when the guys choose to do some of the indoor rides for a moment of reprieve
>”Turmoil of Loath”, a two-person buggy ride through a haunted house
>As is common with your friends, they’ve already paired up and left you as the fifth wheel
>As you’re shunted into the next empty cart, the attendant turns to the queue
>”SINGLE RIDER?” he calls out
>That hits a little too close to home
>But the crowd parts as a stranger hops in with you
>They’re wearing an oversized frilly nightgown and a mushroom-like bonnet, similar to a frumpy grandmother
>At least it’s not a “sexy grandmother” outfit
>The clothes are unremarkable, but holy shit is the mask convincing
>It’s a wolf’s head, incredibly detail with what looks like real fur, dark as coal, and narrow beastly eyes
>Those must be some expensive contacts
>Even the paws have authentic, lethal black claws
>When the lips on the muzzle peel back into a fanged smirk, you feel your whole body tense up
>A hundred thoughts zip through your mind
>Is this for real?
>Is this an actual werewolf?
>Is it too late to run screaming from the ride?
>The last one’s easy to answer: 
>Yes it is, because the safety bar locks you in place just as the cart speeds off
>”What luck,” comes an unmistakably feminine, yet coarse voice. “I didn’t think I would find my Little Red Riding Hood so quickly tonight.”
>She doesn’t take her eyes off you for a second as you barrel towards rickety doors that blast open into darkness
>You’re afraid to break eye contact and risk provoking her
>You’re definitely not going to get to enjoy the ride, either
>The dim glow of the fake candlelight draws shadows into her features
>It should be frightening, and yet the candescence of her golden eyes is almost calming
>The rubber bats, ketchup blood, and grandma clothes also sort of downplay the terror
>”Volfa,” she says
>A-Anon
>“Anon...” she repeats, leaning in closer
>Her breath smells like fruit punch and alcohol
>”Well, I think it’s almost as nice as ‘Little Red’.”
>Your cart enters a room divided by a smoky glass wall
>Another cart passes by on the opposite side, cheesy ghostly effects filtered over them
>Volfa interrupts her gaze long enough to give the other riders a toothy snarl
>The two look awestruck and crane their heads back for one last look before splitting off into the dark again
>”So, Anon....”
>Her attention is entirely on you once more
>”You look like you’re not enjoying yourself much.”
>You tell her...anything you can think of as an excuse
>You’re not a fan of the music
>And the crowds are a little too belligerent
>And nothing about the place is that scary
>You may have said something you’ll regret with that last one
>Volfa gives a raspy chuckle
>”What a relief! Here I thought it was ME making you uncomfortable!”
>You shake your head
>But is it out of fear for what she might do, or confidence since you managed to survive this long?
>”Let me be honest with you,” she continues
>The wolfess reaches up and over to put an arm around your shoulder
>As she does so the sleeve droops back, revealing a spiked bracelet fastened around a fur-covered arm
>”I enjoy messing with people, especially on a night like this. It’s not everyday though I find someone who doesn’t faint or scream at the sight of me.”
>Her claw yanks your hood off so she can scratch your neck
>Gently, chillingly
>”Everyone deserves to have a good time on Halloween, and I’d like to show you nothing less than the best.”
>Good lord this is a long ride
>You try to explain you might have to let your friends know you’d be running off with a stranger you just met
>”Of course. Just tell them you’re nice and safe.”
>You send out a group text, but the moment you hit SEND she snatches your phone away
>It’s devoured into her sleeves before you realize what happened
>”You’ve got an impressive amount of trust in me already. Maybe that’s a bad thing. However, I’m sorry to say I don’t quite trust YOU yet.”
>She gives you an impish wink
>”You’ll get it back in the morning.”
>Morning? 
>Mourning?
>The cart screeches to a halt back at the station, and you’re pulled from the seat even before the safety bar is fully released
>Soon you’re tearing through the throngs of people with the wolfess pulling you along
>Your friends are no place in sight
>Others turn to watch your kidnapping with amusement, but none of them get a good look at the wolfess as she carries you down the streets
>And down back alleys
>And down a rusted cellar
>Down, down...

>When you stop, you’re in what looks like the entrance to catacombs
>But there’s a roomy foyer with rich tapestries and soft orange jack-o’-lanterns that actually make the space inviting
>There’s a bin full of abandoned costumes nearby
>Volfa tears off her bonnet and nightgown, and chucks them with the others
>Now fully revealed, you see she’s entirely wolf-like
>From top to bottom, and tail to breasts
>Pretty modest ones, at that
>Apart from her lupine exterior and lack of shoes, she’s dressed as casually as any other human on any other day
>Slightly frayed jeans
>The spiked bracelet around one arm and several belts around the other
>A busy t-shirt with a band you’ve never heard of under a small vest (unzipped, of course) with a plush collar
>And a classy jeweled choker around her fuzzy neck
>Alright, maybe “casually” was the wrong word
>You start to follow suit and remove your costume, but Volfa stops you before you can unclasp the cloak
>”You may want to leave that on, Little Red. You’ll fit in much better this way.”
>As she leads you through the catacomb passageways, you see why
>It’s a veritable monster mash down here
>Ghouls, mummies, lizard people, stitched-together abominations, and even a few other bestial humanoids
>You’d say “were-creatures” but you distinctly remember the moon being only half full tonight
>This humors Volfa with a hearty laugh
>”Sorry, but THIS is permanent,” she says, flaunting her body with a swish of the tail. >”Born a wolf, live like a monster, do whatever I damn well feel like. Good luck finding many others like me out there.”
>She’s coy with her words, and yet there’s a falter in her grin you almost miss completely
>She rebounds before you can even process it
>”But this night’s about YOU, and I can be the best damn wingman you could have.”
>And just like that she’s back to dragging you along
>There are a few different lounges around the catacombs, but Volfa sniffs out the perfect one
>You’re deposited on a barstool where a skeleton is making drinks
>”The word for tonight is ‘smashed’,” Volfa says. “Pumpkins, liquor, what you do AFTER the liquor...”
>She flourishes her paw over the gathering of monstrous guests
>”How about a nice girl for you?”
>She kneads her paws together with a vulgar motion and another sly wink
>Really driving the point home
>”So, what’s your taste? Nymphs? Vamps? Witches or crones? Well, I KNOW you’re into grandmas.”
>A tray of shots skates your way
>Volfa grabs a glass without missing a beat and hands you an identical one
>It’s so dark it may as well be crude oil
>Thin wisps of smoke rise from the drinks, and it’s a little hot to the touch
>”Hellhound’s Blood” she says
>You gingerly toast and down the drink with a single gulp
>It burns
>Very, very, VERY badly
>You’re gasping for air while Volfa only shivers once
>You are so incapacitated from your drink you almost forget to take the chaser, until Volfa slides you hers as well
>You take the two extra shots; so yellow they look like honey, and throw them both back
>Relief washes over you, leaving a sweaty adrenaline high
>Volfa slaps you on the back
>”They used to think urinating on a wound would treat it, so if the first one was the Hellhound’s Blood....”
>That makes you retch a bit
>”Kidding!” she roars. “Didn’t I warn you I like messing with people?”
>She slaps you again on the back
>Then pats you softer a few times
>Now she’s rubbing you in wide circles
>It actually starts feeling good right before she retracts her paw
>The two of you watch the crowd for a bit, now that you’re no longer the center of attention from the scene you made
>”Hey,” she says
>Her tone is smooth and almost muted
>”When I hang out with others, I go by one rule: do what you want until someone stops having fun.”
>She gives you a pitiful smile, as though ashamed of herself
>”You probably still don’t know what to make of everything, and I’m sorry if I scared you. I really DO want you to have a good time, but if you aren't just say the word and I’ll take you back to your friends.”
>You nod in understanding
>Maybe it’s the endorphins talking, or some kind of Stockholm syndrome setting in, but you really don’t want to leave the wolfess just yet
>But why YOU of all people?
>”Like I said,” Volfa says, “you didn’t flip out AS much as every other human I’ve run into. It’s funny how much your kind loves monster flicks and horror stories, but when you run into the real thing? Pfft.”
>You hear the sounds of rattling chains, distant rumbling, and faint wailing throughout the catacombs
>Playing all together with the creepy ambient music, it’s all orchestrated into the perfect Halloween atmosphere
>Half the patrons look ready for a night of wickedness and the other half are unwinding from it
>Volfa pushes off the bar and extends her paw to you
>The first time of the night she isn’t taking you by force
>”Well, you didn’t let me abduct you just so we can hang around like sad sacks.”

>Volfa leads you farther into the catacombs, passing even more rooms with their own theme of festivities
>The next two hours becomes a party sampler of activity
>You’re flung into one room for some awkward, uninhibited dancing on stained glass floors
>Then you spin into a game room where Volfa plunges her head into a bucket of crimson water to fish out (what you really hope isn’t) a meaty heart
>She wipes the dribble from her mouth and gives you a motion for silence when you get to the next section
>It’s one part maze and one part art display of elaborate silky webbing
>Now you make sense of her warning about making noise:
>Even the slightest sound from navigating through the maze bounces the web all around, threatening to entangle you
>You take it slow and think you get out unscathed, but Volfa pulls off a thick cord of the stuff affixed to your back
>She turns around and you comb her fur for strands as well
>Like a dog after rolling through the mud, she seems to really like you grooming her
>The maze was a nice, slow chance to catch your breath, but the respite doesn’t last long
>There’s a room of nothing but projections of old monster films (the grisly scenes, of course)
>An entire amphitheater with dueling organ pipes
>More bars with various shots of debilitating potency
>And at last you’re off your feet, just the two of you sitting on what you assume is the gums of some colossal creature’s mouth
>Volfa is actually joining you in heavy panting
>”So...ha...you enjoying yourself yet?”
>You can’t speak, so you just give a signal of approval
>But your privacy is interrupted by a gang of trolls who have to duck down to get into the room
>”Volfa? What the hell are you DOING?” the largest one booms
>”I’m resting my feet, ya’ big neanderthal,” she says. “Keep your voice down!”
>The lead troll’s lackeys just scratch their heads while he scrunches his ugly face
>”What are you doin’ with HIM?”
>”Showing Little Red a good time,” Volfa retorts. “What’s it to you?”
>”But a human?” the troll says
>”You lugs bring humans here all the time!” the wolfess says
>”Human FEMALES,” he grunts. “Everyone knows it’s the monster MEN who take humans. It’s only the other way when the human males pair with of the three ‘S’s’”
>He holds up four thick fingers to illustrate
>”Sirens, Succubi, and Shapeshifters. You can’t even pass as a ‘shifter because you’re not an actual WEREwolf”
>Volfa launches to her feet, staring daggers at the troll
>”What the fuck are you trying to say?” she hisses
>”I’m sayin’ either he’s defected in the brain, or you’re just THAT desperate. Human male with female beast pairings don’t work.” He folds his tree-trunk arms across his chest. “That’s the norm around here.”
>”No,” Volfa says with venom, “the ‘norm’ for YOU is to not get ANY female unless you have to beat them over the head and drag them off! Why else would your mother be so deformed?”
>You exchange worried glances with the troll lackeys
>None of you particularly want to get involved
>The lead troll pains himself in anger, trying to think of a response
>But even a giant like him recoils when Volfa stomps forward
>”Enjoy your circlejerk, boys,” she spits while body checking the leader
>Even with him being marginally bigger, the wolfess still sends him reeling
>There’s enough of an opening between the trolls for you to slip out after Volfa
>You’re following her down some kind of secluded hallway, where no parties or even rooms exist
>It’s eerily quiet, especially with neither of you talking
>You realize the end of the corridor deposits you right back at the catacomb foyer
>The bin of costumes is right where you left it
>Volfa slams her fists against the wall a few times and hangs her head
>”I’m sorry, Anon,” she says, her words heavy 
>“I don’t think I can show you a good time anymore. Just tell me when you’re ready to go.”
>But you don’t really want to leave her
>You place a hand on her shoulder
>She inhales sharply at your touch and looks at you with a gloomy smile
>”Heh. Thanks for trying, Anon, but I stick to my rule: do what you want until someone stops having fun. Wish I could say those jackasses didn’t spoil my night.”
>She tries to back off, but you hold on strongly
>Volfa turned a downer night for you into something incredible, and now’s your chance to pay her back
>And you tell her so
>She just shakes her head
>”You don’t have to do anything for me. You gave me everything I could want just by being a good sport and some great company.”
>Everything she could want?
>That catches her off guard completely
>”W-well, I mean, from a human, I don’t....”
>You squirm a bit at “human”, and Volfa’s ears fold back
>“Ah, dammit. That’s not me. I shouldn’t let that prick get under my fur like that.”
>The mischievous side of the dark wolfess returns
>She takes your hand in one paw and puts the other on your shoulder as well
>”That’s a privilege I only give to my Little Red.”
>You can tell she’s waiting for you to make the first move
>But the eagerness in her eyes is as clear as the stars on a cloudless night
>You lock lips, mouth to muzzle
>She drives her tongue deeply inside you, making the taste of fruit punch and alcohol all the more flavorful
>Out of your peripheral you see other monsters walk by
>They dive back out of sight to give the two of you some peace
>At least there are SOME courteous monsters
 >Volfa eventually breaks the kiss, and the string of dribble left over makes you think of the web maze briefly
>Is that endearing, or a little gross?
>”This won’t do at all,” she says
>You think she means the passerby, but she’s tapping the clasp on your cloak with a black nail

>Once again you’re being dragged along by the wolfess
>You were actually starting to miss that
>But you don’t head back toward the heart of the merriment
>Instead, you peel off down yet another overlooked hallway
>Now you’re going up an incline
>And up a winding staircase
>And even climbing up a ladder
>Up, up...
>When you’re at the top you’re in some kind of tiny efficiency apartment
>It’s a very spartan layout, with only a few utilities and a disheveled bed
>But there’s a large sloped window with an absolutely breathtaking view of the midnight city
>You take in as much of the sight as you can
>Which is long enough for Volfa to disrobe down to her fur
>Only the jeweled choker remains
>”I’ve been waiting all night to see a little more of my Little Red”
>Her voice is outspoken and seductive
>You certainly didn’t fall for her because of her subtlety 
>Finally the clasp is broken, and soon you’re joining her in total nudity
>”And don’t worry,” she continues, “I won’t make you say anything cheeky about my teeth, or my ears....”
>It’s not hard to tell what’s she’s playing at
>And yes, she DOES have big, beautiful eyes
>The bed already looks pre-ravished, and it only gets worse as you two tumble onto it
>Your skin is electrified by the touch of her fur
>Her aroma has an earthly, carnal scent
>While you’re trying to burrow into her pelt she’s practically clawing to get inside of you
>Her thighs gyrate over your own, pinning your growing arousal and giving it an occasional squeeze
>She moves to straddle your hips, grabbing your erection with her leathery paws
>”There are a dozen Halloween clichés I could make right now,” she says. “So go ahead and take your pick, my not-so Little Red.”
>And what a treat it is
>She bends over and rolls her tongue along your full length, starting at the sack and lifting the whole thing up
>After several licks she takes the entire package into her muzzle
>You don’t need to look out the window to see stars
>Any warnings you give building up to your release are swiftly ignored
>Your climax is heightened by her last few sucks
>Everything from your orgasm vanishes down her gullet
>Unsurprisingly the only liquid she refuses to let dribble, even as she smacks her lips loudly
>When your strength returns you try to switch with her, but the wolfess continues to pin you down
>”Catch your breath and we’ll move on to the good part.”
>You’re still wet and stiff as she lifts her rump off your legs a bit
>”Like I said, you don’t need to do anything more for me tonight”
>By the time you can rebound, Volfa is already lowering her heat onto you
>”And it’s not like I can’t enjoy this as well,” she says with a wink

>You’re panting together, enjoying the warmth of the other’s body and breath
>You never want to leave her tenderness, so when she escapes your grasp you’re left fruitlessly clinging the air
>”One second, my Little Red, there’s something I want to do first.”
>Even without the illumination of a full moon, Volfa’s shapely, bestial body is silhouetted against the window
>She pushes the glass open and draws in a swelling breath
>And howls
>It’s a howl that reverberates to your core
>Gorgeous, haunting, and proud
>She holds the sound for longer than you’d think possible, carrying over the city
>Even after she tapers off it’s still ringing out there
>Off in the distance, you can hear the Halloween crowds making their own lively barks and howls in response
>Volfa returns to you with a playful expression and throws the sheets over you
>You’re wrapped into her embrace once more, her fur now carrying the scent of the midnight air
>”This is a nice little change of pace,” she purrs. “It doesn’t have to be ALL about the sexual rush.”
>”But the night is young, and we do have a lot to try out before the sunrise.”
>Her nails are combing your hair; her muzzle under your chin
>”And I want to see that with you.”

>You sleep in late
>A twinge of panic rouses you, as your wolfess isn’t there beside you
>But she returns fully dressed and balancing plates of food
>”Little Red had a good sleep,” she says. “Bet some big bad wolf made him give up the ghost.”
>At least five times, you think
>She sets the plates down for a late breakfast
>Little bat pancakes, chain-linked sausages, dripping strawberries
>And a sweet cider you really hope isn’t supposed to be more hellhound piss
>The two of you chow down, but Volfa eats slower as time goes on
>Soon she’s looking at her plate
>Ashamed
>”Anon...” she says when she can’t prolong the meal any longer
>”We need to have a talk”’
>This unfamiliar side of her immediately fills you with dread
>”We’re going to have to separate soon.”
>Your heart just did
>”We...you know, ‘monsters’, live our own lives throughout the year. When Halloween rolls around, we have to follow certain rules to have that kind of freedom.”
>”One of them is, ‘don’t keep humans around when the night is over’.”
>”Halloween’s a wild night; people get hurt or go missing, there’s vandalism and crime, and some of us get...well, a little TOO invested.”
>She tries to force a smile at that
>”So of course the days after all the debauchery are a little tense. Police are out trying to solve crimes, and every dumbass with a camera suddenly thinks they’re a paranormal investigator. We have to lay low for days at a time.”
>”Anon, I can’t do that to you. I couldn’t take you away from your life like I tried to last night.”
>None of the drinks you had last night twisted your stomach as much as how it currently feels
>”But....”
>That one word is all you wanted to hear more than anything right now
>”If you want to make this work,” she continues, “if you feel the same about me as I feel about you...we can think of something.”
>It’s bittersweet news
>Optimistic, but heartbreaking all the same
>You lunge for the wolfess, hoping she won’t actually leave you
>Her snout flares, and she sniffles
>”H-hey, this is hard for me too. Don’t make it worse.”
>Volfa pries herself from your grapple, but keeps her paws on you
>It’s difficult to believe those golden eyes could ever have doubt or uncertainty
>”C’mon, let’s get you dressed.”
>All you have with you are your costume clothes, which you vow to never get rid of
>She hands you the crimson cloak that started it all
>”It’s a cold, sad day out there, and it’ll take you a while to find your way home, Little Red.”
>It still has her hair on it
>You’re never going to wash this thing
>Reluctantly you make the descent back to the catacombs, neither saying a word
>You get a few glimpses of what had been a monster mash just a few hours ago
>There’s litter, debris, and unidentifiable stains everywhere along with a hollow mood
>If you didn’t see the party for yourself, you’d assume this was just an abandoned building
>Nothing left in the foyer but the bin of costumes
>Volfa’s grandma disguise still rests inside
>There’s a lot you could say that would just bring your spirits down even more, but Volfa refuses to go that route again
>”Give it a few weeks for all the heat to die down. If you still want to see a gnarly dog like me again, I’ll come find you.”
>Volfa reaches into her vest pocket and pulls out your phone
>”A deal’s a deal”
>You grab the phone along with her arm and pull her in for one last hug goodbye
>She can’t fight it this time
>”We’ll make it work,” she repeats with her voice breaking. “We’ll make it work.”
>You lose count of how many times she has to say it, both for your sake and her own
>And you can’t remember who it was to make the first move to detach from the other, but you know it was a slow drift apart
>You almost can’t open the cellar door with how weak your body feels
>The light outside is tormenting
>In your momentary blindness, you can only see that stunning silhouette of your wolfess
>Volfa doesn’t take her eyes off you for one second as you close the rusted doors behind you

>Even if you could remember the path you took to get to the monster hideout you’re too distracted to retrace your flight with the dark wolfess
>The towering buildings around you funnel your movement, and every direction you choose gets you closer to the human world
>Plus, every turn you take seems to erase the way back to the cellar
>Eventually you make it back to the streets outside the Freak Fair grounds
>Wearing your costume is much less embarrassing when you see a few others doing the same
>Desperately clinging to the memories of the previous night
>Speaking of people and memories, you remember all those you left behind in the blur of activity
>Your phone is overloaded with messages from different contacts
>Some concerned for your safety
>Some asking if you got lucky
>Some completely oblivious to your absence
>And one...from yourself?
>There’s no mistaking it: you got a message that was sent to you from your own phone
>”Hopefully this will tide you over”
>When the last message is closed, you see what changed
>Your wallpaper was replaced with an image of Volfa
>She’s wearing that spiked bracelet, those arm belts, that elegant choker...
>And nothing else
>You scan the skyline of all the buildings around you
>Somewhere nestled in the middle, unreachable and protected by the cluster, is a derelict apartment building
>At the top is a figure leaning out of a sloped window
>Wearing a frumpy nightgown and bonnet
>And watching over you as you return home



[[ HAIR OF THE DOG PART 2 ]]

>It’s been over three weeks since Halloween
>25 days, specifically
>But who’s counting?
>Almost a month ago you were whisked away from a dull Halloween night for one filled with literal monsters, including the love of your life
>Volfa
>You never have to set an alarm to wake up in the morning these days, because as soon as you’re conscious you’re checking the phone for any word from her
>Nobody would believe you met an anthropomorphic wolf female dressed up like a grandmother that night
>Hell, some of them wouldn't believe you met a female at all
>Now, jaded thoughts intrude your mind, starting to make YOU believe it was never real to begin with
>It takes increasingly more energy just to leave home and face the world
>But then a crinkled letter shows up in the mail
>You hold the envelope like it was your life
>It might as well be, seeing as how life would be meaningless if you can’t share it with Volfa
>Before you get your hopes up TOO much, you check the return address
>You half expect it to just be some kind of insurance bullshit, a bill, or a straight up scam
>When you do a quick internet search your heart leaps up
>It’s the address of the Freak Fair grounds
>You gingerly peel open the envelope, careful not to tear it accidentally
>There’s a ticket inside, stiff in hardness yet warped as though it had been soaked in water (or something else) before
>It’s covered in runes and hole punches, but “one week round trip” is legible
>Also included is a single note, written on a contrastingly immaculate piece of stationary
>[LAST OF THE MONTH. BUS TERMINUS ORANGE. 11:59 PM. DO NOT BE LATE.]
 
>Your life is put on hold leading up to the big night
>Some of the people closest to you are a little concerned, and you probably burned a few bridges with work
>You don’t know whether you should tell anyone you have a girlfriend just yet, especially if you’re just up and leaving so suddenly to be with her
>Several days’ worth of clothes and other provisions have been packed and waiting since you got the letter
>You even call a cab well over an hour before you need to be there
>It’s a cold autumn night to be sitting by yourself at a bus stop
>Just you and your fall jacket
>Crimson red, hooded
>Ten minutes until midnight you get some company
>You were expecting a bus, or a limo, or even a hearse
>What you get instead is just a plain old sedan
>It’s not even made to be creepy or anything
>An elderly man with sagging jowls parks the vehicle in front of you
>He says nothing, not even acknowledging you as he stares off into the distance
>You check your phone every minute, hoping you don’t miss something
>11:59 PM
>”Ticket, please,” he moans
>You thrust the ticket at him, which he gives another hole punch and returns to you
>You dive into the car; the possible danger of the situation doesn’t cross your mind at all
>It’s too grimy to see out the windows as the ride veers multiple times
>”It’s sweltering in here,” the driver says
>He grabs the loose flabs of skin on his face and pulls the whole thing off, leaving only muscle stretched over bone
>You feel like you should be shocked or terrified, but Halloween really desensitized you to a lot of crazy shit
>The car soon falls into a smoother, turn-free cruise
>Hours pass by
>And you can’t fend off sleep forever....
 
>You wake up still in the car
>Dawn manages to pierce through the obscured windows
>”We’re just about there,” says the driver, picking at his exposed tissue
>You feel relief at not being murdered (or worse) in your sleep
>Then you feel excitement as you see a gothic station come into view
>This is just like in the movies!
>You’re fidgeting in the seat as the driver finds a spot to drop you off
>The sight of monsters and other supernatural creatures milling about inside almost doesn’t faze you in the slightest
>You seem to be getting more attention than you’re paying to any of them
>But you’re on a mission, and there will be time to gawk later
>Still, you make sure to scan everything you can just for a glimpse of...
>There she is
>Tattered jeans and a busy t-shirt of a metal band
>A long-sleeved version of a familiar vest, complete with the same plush collar
>A lavish jeweled choker that gleams to draw your sight to her
>Arm held against an archway, leaning with one leg over the other, and positively beaming at you
>Volfa
>She’s trying to play cool as much as possible, but as you run towards her she abandons any amount of composure she had
>There’s no forgetting the strength of the wolfess as she lifts you up for a hug
>You did it
>You made it work
>”It’s so good to see you again, Little Red,” she says, holding back tears
>Her raspy, subdued voice is the greatest you’ve ever heard
>She gives your jacket a feel after setting you down
>”I like it. Not as cute as that Halloween cloak of yours, but at least you got one with a nice hood!”
>Now that you’re safely reunited with the dark wolfess you’re able to take in the sights and sounds
>There are the mummies and vampires you’d normally expect, along with some pretty eldritch and indescribable abominations
>And whether through coincidence or a good sense of humor, most of the shops and restaurant stalls in the station are just like human equivalents with cheesy, spooky-themed names
>Once again, monsters stare right back at you
>”Haha, I guess you really don’t see any of this as strange until you got a human buddy with you,” she says
>A paw clasps your shoulder and the wolfess leans over
>”I’m still the best wingman you’ll ever have, so just stick close to me, alright?”
>You exchange wide smiles
>Hers falters for a moment, and that’s enough to put unease in your heart
>Volfa immediately brings her cheery, toothy demeanor back out
>”Hey, nothing’s wrong. Well, at least nothing we’re not gonna fix right now.”
>You continue walking through the station, through some lesser-traveled parts
>”I’m not sure if anyone has broken the bad news to you before, but...I’m afraid you’re a human, Little Red.”
>You give her a look of mock surprise
>”Yeah, I know, it’s heartbreaking. Inoperable too, unfortunately.”
>You glance at the directional signs as you pass them, one in particular you seem to be following
>Licensing and Customs
>”Yeah, we’re going to need to check you in before going anywhere. Not like we don’t have humans here, but those are usually your sorcery types with magic in the blood. Anyone we bring over from ‘your’ world needs to come here first.”
>The hallway leading to the customs office is barren compared to the rest of the station
>Obviously not needed extremely often
>”Getting approval is next to impossible by yourself. That’s why I’m gonna be your sponsor, Little Red.”
>Her muzzle hovers close to your face, and you plant a kiss against her black lips
>She pulls you firmly into her torso
>”Woah, down boy, easy! I’m just as pent up as you are, but it’ll make the payoff so much better if you can reel it in just a little longer, alright?.”
>You nod in understanding
>She waited patiently for you, and you can do the same for her
 
>The customs office is bigger than you’d expect for such little traffic
>Of course, you soon see that’s entirely for the sake of the head supervisor
>Your neck doesn’t even reach the top of his desk, and cigar fumes smokescreen the ceiling completely
>Only the middle head is smoking
>The right one is absorbed in a phone conversation
>The left one is busy with paperwork
>A massive cerberus, straining a dapper business suit
>The middle head takes one last draw of his cigar before setting it aside, smoke venting from his nostrils
>”Back again so soon, Volfa?” he says
>His casual voice is enough to reverberate through your body
>”Nah, just got lost on the way to the little girls’ room,” the wolfess says
>”So I see,” the middle head responds
>He looks at you with disdain
>”I assume this is the one you’ve flippantly ignored getting pre-approval to bring to our world?”
>”Yup,” Volfa says. “This is Anon, and it turns out he doesn’t NEED your bullshit pre-approval.”
>The desk is higher than even Volfa’s pointed ears, but she pulls herself up to the ledge and hangs there with her head in her paws
>”So then,” the cerberus continues, “does that mean he is magically awakened? Or a registered human ambassador? Or a provable deity reincarnation?”
>”Nope,” Volfa says. “He’s my lifekin.”
>The left head snaps his pen like a twig, spraying blood-red ink everywhere
>”I’m going to have to call you back,” the right head growls before slamming his phone down
>All three parts to the colossal hound are fixated on you
>”He’s your...lifekin?”
>”Yeah, funny story. Turns out after Halloween was over I realized I was DYING without having him close by. Got checked out by an apothecary and everything.”
>”So I see,” the cerberus seethes. “Regardless, he still needs the appropriate paperwork to be considered your lifekin. I’ve already made a GENEROUS exception giving him the ticket here, which, might I remind you, is valid only for ONE WEEK.”
>”You got a lot more excuses than exceptions,” the wolfess barks back. “You better not have forgotten the bet we made, either.”
>Volfa unfolds a stack of papers from her jacket and slams them on the desk
>”Anyway, here you go. All in writing from the doc herself. And if you want to confront her about it, be my guest. I hear she’s still a bit sour about needing to get a ‘practitioner’s license’.”
>The cerberus doesn’t even look at the papers before shoving them aside into a built up pile
>”Be that as it may, he will still have to go back to where he came from after his week is over.”
>Volfa’s face is full of spite
>”You wouldn’t KILL a poor girl like that, would you?” she says
>The flame in the cerberus’ six eyes tells you Volfa may have crossed the line with that remark, but the context of their feud is lost to you
>The middle head straightens his tie
>”Then I highly recommend you start filling out his paperwork for a return visit, and likewise for yourself if you ever want to visit him outside of our sanctioned yearly events.”
>He grabs out the largest, sharpest fountain pen you’ve ever seen
>Much more like a dagger than a writing utensil
>”I hope we’ve come to an understanding. Now then, on to the records. What is his name, again?”
>”Why don’t you fucking ask him yourself, old man?”
 
>The two of you leave the office without any forms, receipts, permits, or passports
>And yet, you have subtle feeling of belonging to this world now
>”Yeah, we don’t do that crap here,” Volfa says. “Not all monsters have clothes, let alone pockets. Where are they going to keep an ID card?”
>You ask her what a “lifekin” is supposed to be
>”‘Lifekin’ is just what it sounds like: people bonded for life. It’s usually for master/servant magical pacts, or some kind of, ah, symbiotic relationship? Body stuff, you know.”
>And now you’re her lifekin?
>She’s quiet for a moment
>”Might as well be. After we said our goodbyes, I got really, really sick.”
>You open your mouth to say something, thinking back to your Halloween dalliance
>”Ha, not like THAT!”
>She punches you on the arm
>“Don’t worry, you won’t be seeing a bunch of little Little Reds all over the place. Not yet, anyway. But I wasn’t sure what was going on. I thought maybe my depression drinking caught up with me, or I had some nasty bug from the Halloween crowds.”
>She leans over and gives you a sloppy lick from neck to ear
>”And now you have it, too.”
>You don’t want to touch the saliva
>A little because you’re afraid she’s right
>And a little because you want to keep any reminder of her
>”Ha! C’mon, you think just because we’re back together I’m gonna stop messing with you?”
>At this point, you wouldn’t care if you shared an illness with Volfa
>”Anyway, it was stupid to deny what it REALLY was. I was pretty smitten with you, Little Red. Heh, who would have thought THAT would be the thing to do me in?”
>Her head rests on yours
>”Buuut just to be sure, I got a second opinion from a sweet little apothecary, and she was more than happy to get her diagnosis in writing. Didn’t think it’d be so easy to get a doctor’s excuse for puppy love.”
>The outside of the station is on a hill (probably for aerodynamic monsters) overlooking an endless stretch of patchwork terrain
>Fields of gnarled crops, gaseous purple swamps, forests that shake with something huge moving inside them...
>It’s everything you’d imagine a land of monsters would live in
>Except maybe the scattered towns with some pretty high, modern towers
>”What, you think we all just live in huts or caves or something?”
>She points to a small glade nestled in the middle of all the intersecting domains
>”That’s where we’re going. Gonna have to explore every little space we can while you’re here.”
>Volfa gives you a wink
>”And after that, maybe I’ll even show you around town, too!”
>Boy is she pent up
 
>Gulchgut is a rather tight-knit town that looks like the residents are putting off removing their Halloween decorations for as long as possible, even after a month later
>”It’s a pretty big deal here,” Volfa says, “in case you didn’t notice.”
>You see even more unique and unimaginable creatures here than you did at the station
>And still, it’s you who gets the most stares
>But the faces (or at least what looks like a face) of the townsfolk brighten up when they see Volfa happily escorting you
>”Volfa! Is this the lucky one you’ve been talking about so much?” says a cauliflower-like spore, her children affixed to her back
>”Sure is!” the wolfess says proudly. “Can’t stop to introduce him to everyone yet. Gotta freshen up first. He’s really dirty.”
>”Oh? Well I’m no stranger to dirt, and he doesn’t look that...a-ah, I see!”
>The spore mother puffs up sheepishly
>Volfa leads you to a weathered apartment building with a sunken in roof
>Orange lights are stringed around it like chains, there are little bat stickers on the windows, and piles of decomposing pumpkins flank the main doors
>Volfa takes you by the hand, racing you inside
>Just like old times
>The inside has no consistent design or pattern to its layout
>Hallways twist and turn with dozens of doors all shapes and sizes
>Some corridors have simple carpet
>Some are filled with plants or bones
>Some have entrances you’d have to jump (or fly) to reach
>But once on the right floor, it’s impossible to miss her place
>Mostly because the door has “Volfa” carved deeply into it
>”Not like you’re going to reuse a monster’s room when they’re done with it,” she laughs. “You’re never getting your safety deposit back, that’s for damn sure.”
>Inside is exactly what you pictured the wolfess’ den to be
>Wall-to-wall posters of monster bands like the one on her shirt
>Bottles decorating the shelf space that all the clutter on the floor should be using instead
>A nest of bed sheets and clothes strewn about
>The only thing neatly organized you see is a familiar nightgown and bonnet resting on a table
>”It’s not like I was wearing it or anything!” she says, pitching the costume out of sight
>She then removes your jacket and folds it onto the now vacant space
>Her own jacket comes off and is placed on top, with her spiked bracelet like a crown on top
>”Much better. Gotta keep this clean and safe when you’re not wearing it. Everyone needs to know you’re MY Little Red when we’re out and about.”
>When you get a better look at the wall decoration you see probably the only formal picture in the room
>The three faces of whom you didn’t expect to see again so soon are fighting over the affection they’re giving to a lone, dark-haired female human
>She’s wearing a jeweled choker, and has subtle but familiar features that have been engraved into your thoughts since that fateful Halloween night
>”Yeah, that’s her,” Volfa says grimly. “Uncanny resemblance, right? No need to tell the whole story, because I’m sure you’ve heard this kind of thing countless times already.”
>”Beast man meets woman, the two fall in love, some miracle brings a bastard child into the world, woman dies in childbirth. None of the medical practice in the monster world knew what to do with a human.”
>Volfa plays around with the choker on her neck
>”Frankly, I’m surprised the old man didn’t split her in half on the honeymoon. He got pretty despondent, though. Guess I was the lucky one for not being too attached to her.”
>She walks over to the picture and flips it around
>”But they don’t need to see this “
>She claws at the hem of her shirt
>”You’re here for a week, so let’s start making the most of it. That’s seven times longer than we had the last time!”
>She wriggles her hips side to side as her top is yanked off, letting her humble breasts flop out unrestrained
>”Fourteen times, now that I think about it. We only hung out for like half a day, and what is that, like at least SIXTY half days since we last saw each other?
>She turns around and bends over to kick off her pants
>With a flick of her tail you see Volfa’s swollen lips, an arousal over a month in waiting
>”But who’s counting?”
>One second she’s teasing you from across the room, the next she’s at your pants before you can pull your own shirt all the way over your head
>She hasn’t lost one bit of her skill at drawing your manhood to an almost painful hardness as she inhales it into her muzzle
>And it doesn’t take long before she’s already bringing you close to your limit
>But unlike last time, she heeds your warnings and lets go with a slick pop
>”That won’t work,” she says.
>”Like I told you, I’m just as backed up as you. If we’re going to finally be together, shouldn’t we get it all OUT together?”
>She makes a good argument, but damn if you’re not at the breaking point
>Volfa crawls onto the disheveled bed and presents herself to you
>”But I’ll let you take the wheel first, since I had to be the one to break your heart last time.”
>She shakes her rump as you kneel onto the bed behind her
>You part her tender lips and dig in with your fingers
>Your tongue finds a deep passage, ending with a flick against her button
>Her tail reflexively bats you on the head
>”S-stop! Anon! “I’ve been THIS close for ages now! Don’t you d-dare get me off first, unders-stand? Just put the damn thing in already!”
>You try to get a few more seconds out of her, but that’s a huge mistake
>Her toned leg hooks around your neck and flips you onto your back
>Volfa’s now on top with her rear planted on your face, stifling you with her wet heat
>She squeezes your erection and raps a claw against your raw head
>”Oh, you don’t want to see me be the BAD wolf, Little Red. Keep testing me and I’ll take my bracelet and use it as a cock ring, with the spikes turned INWARD. Now, are you ready to do this right?”
>You try to give her a muffled response, which only tickles her delicate bits worse
>”AH, g-good then.”
>She lifts herself off your head, only to twist around and sink down onto your shaft
>You’re locked with her golden eyes
>”I can’t stay angry at you, Little Red.”
>With a strained “ruff”, she begins rocking
>The heat of her insides and the reddening marks from her claws on your chest make you feel like you’re burning up
>You’re sweating, and she’s trying to soak up as much as she can with her paws
>She’s fighting against her orgasm more than trying to build up to it
>”I...hah, you might...uggh....”
>Her thoughts are fragmented by her urges
>”N-no, not...yet.”
>Her efforts to stave the climax for just a moment longer recoil back at her
>Her face freezes, and a throaty whine escapes as her orgasm wracks her to the core
>It would have been a slow deflation of pleasure, if it weren’t for your release hitting her the very next second
>You’ve all but fried her mind as her climax rebounds
>Any semblance of restraint was thrown out with the most uninhibited groans and gasps you’ve ever heard from her
 “God...dammit, Little Red. I don’t want to have to sleep in because you wore me out so much already.”

>It’s the shortest, most action-filled week of your life
>Volfa has something planned for every day
>And every night
>Your first full day is spent in Gulchgut, getting to know all the locals
>You meet an endless number of monsters. Friends and neighbors and a few strangers
>You try to remember as many as you can, but half of their names are unpronounceable anyway
>Thanks to Volfa, you’re accepted as one of their own within minutes
>Nothing goes unshared with these creatures, from greetings to stories to more trinkets that you know what to do with
>The food they provide isn’t too bad either, once you close your eyes and try to ignore where it might have come from
>When night stops by, the wolfess brings you to the tallest structure in the town: the bell tower
>”Alright, pants off,” she commands
>What, right here?
>”It’s not like most of them haven’t heard our little tryst last night. If we’re out in the open like this, they’ll still know to give us some space.”
>It doesn’t do much to ease your doubts, but once she’s at your groin again there’s no stopping her, or your erection
>When she howls her climax, it reverberates above you in the massive bell
>The second day is at the murky, bubbling wastes of the swamps
>It’s incredibly viscous, but despite the fetid look it’s safe enough for the two of you to wade in
>”Watch out if something tries to pull you under,” she says. “It’s probably me....”
>She doesn’t “splash” you so much as hurls a glob of sludge at you
>You both have to take a shower to wash out all the gunk, but it’s the perfect opportunity for a little “deep cleaning” in the shower later on
>The third day is at the biggest museum of dungeon designs, famous monsters, and torture devices in history
>”Just let me know if there’s anything you want to try out,” the wolfess whispers in your ear as you pass by the bondage displays
>You end up leaving the gift shop with a few extra belts for her arm’s vast collection
>A few for you as well
>Not for daytime use
>And she tightens them every time you make a dog joke (or she baits you into saying one)
>The forth day is at the Gulch Brawl, a free-for-all of monsters constantly pouring into the ring for a bit of “unwinding” and king-of-the-hill-style feats of strength
>The smart ones run away as soon as Volfa jumps in
>The dumb ones at least try not to land on their faces when she throws them off the hill
>You head home with yet another belt, though this one’s entirely for the wolfess
>”It’s nice, but not something I’d wear,” she shrugs, trying to fit it over her arm rather than her waist
>“But those knuckleheads didn’t get all my aggression out. I think you know what that means, Little Red....”
>Your pelvis already starts to ache
>Each day has a life’s worth of memories, but it’s not without trepidation
>Every morning you wake up alone, fear rushing back as you remember the first time you were in an empty, foreign bed without her
>Volfa appears not long after, reassuring you with your first kiss of the day
>But each time she returns she’s increasingly haggard looking
>When you ask her about it, you never get a good answer
>”Don’t worry about it, Little Red,” she says. “Just a little bit of business. As much as I’d love it, we can’t be connected at the hip ALL the time, right?”
>Isn’t that what lifekin are supposed to be, though?
>You don’t tell her that
>On the night of the fifth day Volfa leaves you alone a second time, and is visibly stressed when she comes back
>”Just getting things ready,” she pants
>For what?
>”Just wait. You’re gonna love this!”
 
>When night falls, she leads you to an old mausoleum on the edge of town
>You can hear the bass of music coming from underground before you even enter
>She opens the door at the bottom of the stairs with a flourish and you’re struck with nostalgia
>”Just like Halloween, yeah?”
>It’s not exactly like the catacombs, but it’s pretty damn close
>In fact, a lot of it seems like it’s made to be as much of an imitation as possible
>The decorations, the music, the guests...
>Is this what she was always running off to do in the morning?
>”Hmm? Oh, yeah, you got me! Just had to get everything ready for our repeat performance! Everyone’s been helping me make the place just right!”
>Well it’s certainly an impressive effort, but something’s not right
>That’s when you notice Volfa’s barren neck
>Was it like that before she left you the second time today?
>”O-oh, my choker?” She winces at the word
>”Must have misplaced it somewhere, I’m sure it’ll turn up eventually, heh....”
>Her voice tells a different story, like a mother saying she “misplaced” her only child
>But she doesn’t dwell on it for very long, and you’re soon dragged through the various rooms of the party
>A little harder than you remember
>”Do you remember what order we did things in? I’m sure we’ll remember if...oh, drinks first! Trying to think what we all had.... Ah, screw it. We’ll just have to try every combination we can think of!””
>True to her word, the festivities start off with some pretty heavy drinking
>What was once nausea from thinking you drank the piss of a hellhound is now just regular old binge drinking nausea
>Even Volfa seems to have hit the bottle a little too hard when you stagger out of the bar
>She was already looking pretty wiped before you even started
>The events in each room are set up vary similarly to before, with only a few minor changes to account for the space and attendance
>The other partygoers don’t even seem too invested
>They remind you of movie extras, paid just to be in the background
>Halloween was a blur of excitement, but now it feels like forcing through the motions a second time
>And with Volfa being a little tipsier, she stumbles through most of it
>Knocking over tables, missing targets in games, getting stuck in the web maze
>She’s even more worn out than you when you end up in the same kind of monster-mouth room with gums for cushions
>”Hah, hah. Man, we did all that and still have the whole night!” she hoots
>”I think we could probably do another whole lap around the place, maybe even two! Where are those trolls? I need something to hit!”
>It’s time to put your foot down
>”What’s wrong, Little Red? Don’t tell me you’re throwing in the towel already! Come on!”
>You didn’t go throw the whole Halloween gauntlet just to see her so out of character from the wolfess you knew before
>”B-but...this night’s about YOU, Little Red! I’ve been trying to find a way to keep us together all week, and now I just want to spend as much as I can with you! I did everything I could for this....”
>It hurts you to hear her begging, and it hurts even more to have to remind Volfa of her one rule:
>Do what you want until someone stops having fun
>She genuinely looks crushed
>But there’s acknowledgement in her eyes, as though she’s aware she needed to hear those words from you
>”I get it...I’m sorry. I pushed you a little too hard back there. It really IS supposed to be your night, and I guess I tried to make it too much about MY memories.”
>She sighs dejectedly
>”Well, can we at least grab a few more drinks before we head back?”
>It’s a mistake to give in to her, because “a few” turns out to be borderline lethal for her
>She’s leaning on you for support as you walk her back home
>”Maybe thish is for the bess,” Volfa slurs once back in the apartment building. “I’d rather spend the night juss with my Rittle Led instead of those losers!”
>There’s a smell of fruit punch and alcohol on her breath, with the latter much more noxious
>It would be sweetly reminiscent if you weren’t so concerned about her
>She’s throwing herself over you as you enter her room
>Her full weight on you makes your knees quake
>”C’mon, let me see Big Red again!”
>It’s not a matter of if you want it or not, but that she looks so pitiful trying to win you over
>She can barely get her shirt and pants off, and by then you’re leading her to the bed and tucking her in
>Her confusion is oddly sobering for her
>”W-wait! It’s not time for sleep yet! We have the whole night for fucking! When did you turn into such a prude!?”
>You hold her tight, trying to calm her down
>”Is it my buzz? I can still show you a good time! What do you want me to do for you!?”
>She’s listing off some unbelievably raunchy sex acts, even for her
>You stand your ground and refuse to let go of her as she tries to worm from the bed
>Then she goes still
>You saw the wolfess upset not long after you met her on Halloween when you had to part ways
>You saw brief uncertainty in her promise to see you again the following morning
>You saw her fight back tears and hold down sadness when you gave each other what you thought was your last hug
>You’ve never, ever seen her outright weeping
>She’s sobbing hysterically into your chest, her willpower finally gone
>”L-Little Red...Anon, please! You’re m-my lifekin! You’re my LIFE!”
>All the air in her lungs turns into mournful howling
>It’s nothing like the music of satisfaction she gave to the city that night
>”P-please! Don’t leave me again! I don’t want anyone leaving me ever a-again! I don’t want to be ALONE again!”
>The proud, bestial woman you knew, reduced to a wailing, trembling pup
>”Anon...Anon, please....”
>Her pleas turn to whispers
>”Anon...love you....”
>Then she’s silent
>But you can still feel her mouth the words
>Only when she cries herself to sleep do you get some peace
>The last thing you ever wanted is to not have her always by your side
>Now, you almost find yourself wishing for a wholly different wolfess than the one lying in a fetal position next to you
>Wishing for your guide, your wingman, your lover
>The Volfa you met that Halloween night
 
>It’s a morning you wish you didn’t have to wake up to
>Your arms and chest are covered in lacerations from Volfa’s clawing embrace throughout the night
>She let go of you sometime early morning, and for a brief moment you fear she might be dead as you try rousing her
>The fatigue from the whole night on top of all the alcohol has made her utterly catatonic
>There was something she was trying to do that was wearing her out
>It wasn’t about the party, you’re sure of it
>And you’re going to finish it for her, for her sake
>You leave a quick note for her, something along the lines of, “Be back soon”
>You wonder whether it would worry her more if you left your red coat behind, as though you were leaving her a parting gift
>Or if you took it with you, as though you were taking the last piece of you out of her life
>You decide to take it with you; all the monsters know you as Little Red, even if not by name
>You find the spore mother not far outside the apartment building
>Her and most of those around her stare at you and the space where Volfa should be
>”Anon, dear, where’s Volfa? Is something wrong?”
>You ask her if there’s anything she knows about Volfa and what she was doing
>”Well, she’s been with you most of the week. Other than that I’ve seen her visiting Medafet, the apothecary, a lot recently. Probably at least once a day. Now, what’s happened with the girl?”
>You try to tell her you need to do something for her, alone
>It doesn’t do much to satisfy the spore mother
>”I hope you know exactly WHAT it is you’re doing, Anon. We may be all different kinds of monsters, but we take care of our own like family, and nobody wants to see that poor girl hurt.”
>She inflates to a much more imposing size
>Venom’s in her glare
>”You won’t make it back to the human world if you’ve done something to her.”
>You nod in fear
>Nod and ask for directions
 
>Medafet’s shop is the amalgamation of every unnerving idea you can think when you hear the word “witchdoctor”
>Bifurcated, unidentifiable creatures strung from the ceiling
>Jars of wisps and spirits and gazing eyeballs
>Shadowy corners where no light exists and anything could be hiding
>Shelves straining under the weight of a hundred curios
>You just assume she’s part of the display until she blows pipe smoke toward you
>A robed, emaciated feline with sickly yellow fur (or skin, as she looks entirely hairless) and beetle eyes
>She says nothing until you introduce yourself
>”Did you think I wouldn’t know the human who has been the subject of all the gossip this past week? This past MONTH?”
>It’s a little exciting to be a celebrity
>But if you can’t help Volfa, you might as well be the enemy of every monster here
>”You’ve met just about everyone in Gulchgut, Anon, but you’ve waited until now to come to me? Well, better late than never. Volfa has told me SO much about you.”
>Medafet bares her teeth in the most Cheshire smile you wish you hadn’t seen
>”In fact, she is so infatuated with you that she’d use a pet name, one she obviously NEVER uses except only in the intimacy of your company.”
>A slender hand with overgrown nails reaches forward and strokes your red hooded jacket
>”How many times do you think she’s called you by that name? More than your real one at this point? More than any of her family’s names? Oh, she would do anything to have you....”
>Noises around the shop chime and clatter, as though taunting you with every word from the cat
>”Which is why she returns to me day after day with a tribute, hoping I can help her find some way to be with you forever.”
>”Sometimes it’s coin and gems....”
>”Sometimes it’s rare and dangerous ingredients....”
>”Sometimes it’s her dearest possessions.”
>You think back to Volfa’s bare neck with guilt
>”But alas, it’s never quite enough to gratify me. What she asks is not something I can so frivolously hand out. I need something of VALUE in this exchange....”
>She grows, standing to full height that seems almost impeded by the cramped shop ceiling
>From out of her robes she pulls a horrifying instrument
>A twisted fusion of dagger and syringe, with dried gore on its blade
>”So then, Anon, what would you give to me in exchange for what your Volfa seeks?”
>”All your wealth? Some blood? A limb?”
>”Your life?
>”Your soul?”
>Yes
>Anything
>Everything
>You won’t let a single obstacle stand in your way
>Medafet chuckles, making her whole body rise and fall
>”What a predictable response. They all say that just before they run with their tails between their legs, even abandoning the thing they love most.”
>”And yet, I shouldn’t dismiss your answer as insincere just yet. I hope to be pleasantly surprised someday.”
>”Now, how about this one: would you rather be together with Volfa forever, or wish to see her happy?”
>Both
>”Yes, of course, hero. But if you had to choose-“
>Both
>Anything
>Everything
>Whatever it takes
>Medafet gives you an unimpressed look
>Does she think you’re mocking the seriousness of her questions?
>Does she think you’re lying?
>She lifts her weapon high into the air and throws it down with a sickening THUNK
>It sticks into a table, vibrating slightly from the impact
>Her whole body arcs over you like the crescent moon
>And she smiles
>Not mischievously, but in merriment
>”That’s all I needed to hear.”
>From out of your view she pulls a small wooden box, an exquisite cherry wood with not a speck of dust on it
>”This is what she wants.”
>That’s it?
>You won?
>Just like that?
>”My sweet Anon, Volfa is very dear to my heart. I was a midwife to her mother through her pregnancy, though she likely has no idea. I wanted to watch her grow from afar, and I doubt her father ever let on what he knows.”
>”And speaking of her old man, I was the one who persuaded him to accept you into our world when Volfa’s requests were denied. I needed to see this ‘Anon’ she has gushed about for the last several weeks.”
>The whole thing feels incredulous
>You’re still reeling from what was impending death seconds ago
>Now you’re trying to take in everything the cat is saying, hoping it’s not a cruel joke
>”Yes, I wrote the ‘ doctor’s excuse’ she gave him. Your ‘official’ lifekin with her, in writing. But, I didn’t give her what she wants most now, because I needed to make sure her love was authentic. She’s proven her loyalty, but I needed to hear it come from you as well. It worried me each day I saw her without you by her side.”
>When an intimidating figure like Medafet looks sad, there’s something that magnifies the emotion to its fullest level
>Her face is the very embodiment of the “tragedy” mask
>”But, I’m sure she kept you away from here because she didn’t want to show her vulnerability, her weakness. It truly pained me to have a solution for her troubles but have to deny her so many times, and when I saw her last, there was something in her I never expected:”
>”Defeat.”
>”She knew her time was running out, which is why she wanted to spend her last few moments with you, and not divulge to you the life she could have given you if successful to spare you from the disappointment.”
>”But, nobody should have to witness a girl miserable like that. I still have a heart after all these years. Please, take this.”
>You accept the box from her, and she holds up a finger for patience
>”And, this as well.”
>From behind a counter she pulls out a folded pile of clothes
>Specifically, a nightgown and a bonnet
>”I’m sure she would like these back. It was an endearing gesture as one of her tributes, but they don’t exactly fit me.”
>You thank her for all she’s done
>Even though her methods are a little terrifying, motioning to the instrument stuck in the table
>”What can I say,” Medafet shrugs, “I enjoy messing with people.”
 
>You rush back to Volfa’s place, ignoring the confused looks and inquiries of the monsters
>You fling the door open and see her gazing at your note solemnly, as though it was truly the last thing you left her
>The wolfess quickly turns to you with an aching smile
>”I’m...glad you came back. I mean, I knew you wouldn’t leave without a proper goodbye, right?”
>You drop your gifts just in time to avoid getting smothered by Volfa’s embrace.
>”But, any time away from you...it’s hell, ya’ know? Now I can see what I put you through every morning I left you alone in our bed.”
>She’s burying into your comfort, almost breaking down again
>”I don’t ever want to wake up without you there, Anon. And I never want to be the idiot who leaves you in the first place.”
>You pat her reassuringly, trying to turn her to see the gifts
>She notices the costume first, looking like she’s seen a ghost
>Or rather, what YOU would look like, since ghosts are pretty much as abundant as squirrels here
>”How did you get that back?”
>She picks the nightgown up, revealing the box underneath
>”And what’s...that?”
>You tell her you don’t really know, but it’s from Medafet
>Volfa, on the other hand, seems to know exactly what it is the moment you say the cat’s name
>”H-how!? Do you know how long I’ve been trying to get something like this from her? What did you even GIVE her?”
>The truth, you reply
>She pries the lid off, almost snapping it from its hinges
>It surprises you more than her to see her jeweled choker sitting on a small velvet cushion inside
>It’s a little underwhelming, you have to admit, though you’re still happy she got her heirloom back
>But this is supposed to be the answer to your problems?
>Volfa secures the choker around her plush scruff, right where it belongs
>The jewels radiate more than usual in the mid-morning light
>She gives you another backbreaking hug, and the warmth from her neck feels as though you’re wearing the choker as well
>When she backs off, she’s holding your shoulders
>”So, what d’ya think?”
>It’s absolutely gorgeous
>But again, how does it help your situation?
>There’s a smug grin on her face as she spins you around
>In the cramped space on the mirror not covered in posters, framed as though in a collage, are two happy faces
>Both human
>The girl beside you unmistakably has Volfa’s dark hair, golden eyes, and bountiful spirit
>A spitting image of her mother, hanging on the wall nearby with her own sweetheart
>”So, NOW what do you think?”
>It’s an incredible illusion
>Though you still prefer your wolfess fuzzier
>”HAH! I had a feeling you’d say that!”
>She gives you a thorough lick on the cheek, which looks a little odd coming from the human girl in the mirror
>”It’s a glamour charm. It’s not going to be fooling a lot of monsters, but humans and anything they look through are going to see just the disguise.”
>You’re spun back around to meet face-to-face with your wolfess love
>”The only other thing that can tell the difference is the unbroken gaze of my Little Red. Going back to the human world is never going to be a hurdle again!”
>She brandishes her arm around the whole room
>”Gotta be honest, I’d prefer to have us live here as your permanent home, but I’d love to meet your friends and family. Plus, we gotta make a return to Freak Fair next year, right?”
>But what about getting back and forth between worlds? What about the rules?
>Volfa gives you a wicked look
>”Don’t you worry. My old man bet me that if I ever found a way to convincingly blend in with humans, he’d give us TOTAL exemption from those stupid travel rules. Well, I fucking hope he likes the taste of crow, because I'm going to be shoving his little wager down all three of his throats!”
>You bop the wolfess on the nose playfully
>Her tongue ejects like a cash register
>”Man, I’m so glad she let me have this back,” Volfa says, tapping the jewels on her choker, “and it’s a pretty nice box to keep it in! Not that I’m ever going to take it off again....”
>Come to think of it, the box did seem unusually heavy
>You remove the cushion, and Volfa sputters in embarrassment
>”H-ha ha...well, when I told Medafet how much I love you, I might have...heh...ran my mouth off about some pretty loft dreams for our future.”
>Hidden at the bottom of the box are two vials: one red, and one gold
>There’s writing above each of them respectively
>”His”
>”Hers”
>And an etching of a heart between them
>”When you’re ready, of course,” she laughs. “No rush. I mean, if you still want to, ah....”
>You lean into Volfa for an impassioned kiss
>The choker warms up between you, comfortably
>You pause for air and a chance to get another good look at her wild attractiveness
>When you go in for more, she wraps her arm around your neck and tussles your hair roughly
>She pulls your crimson hood over your head and brings you in for another hug, blinding you to all but her dark fur
>”And I hope you never stop wearing this, either!” she says, patting your back
>That might make SOME things a little complicated, you think
>She laughs
>”How many times am I going to have to say it to you, Little Red?”
>Even without seeing her face, you can imagine the look of rapture she has
>And you can hear the waver in her voice
>”We’ll make it work.”



[[ HAIR OF THE DOG PART 3 ]]

>”Get the lead out, Anon! You’d better not make us late!”
>You and Volfa are rushing through the monster station, drawing even more attention than usual
>On top of carrying BOTH your luggage, she keeps several strides ahead of you thanks to her long, powerful legs
>Just two days ago you weren’t sure what your future with the dark wolfess would be
>Now you’re on your way back to visit the human world with her
>She seems even more excited than you
>And of course it’s because of her you’re running late
>The wolfess wouldn’t let go of you while you packed
>”There’s no way your home is cooler than mine,” she sneered as you made the plans, “but I want to see it anyway. Gotta check out the dull life Little Red had before meeting me!”
>Truthfully you don’t really want to stay in the human world for long either
>However, there are still people who care enough about you, and you at least owe them an explanation for your sudden disappearance
>”Just need to make one last stop,” Volfa says, steering you down the hall to “Licensing and Customs”
>Oh, the “little girls’ room” again?
>”You’re lucky I don’t have a free paw, buddy.”
>That doesn’t stop her from ramming into you
>”Anyway, this will only take a sec. I already ‘pre-approved’ everything with the old man yesterday.”
>Indeed, Volfa launched out of her place to see her father and square things away
>It would likely be the last time you ever have to leave her side
>You walk into the office of the massive cerberus, who’s keeping himself busy with calls and paperwork
>”Here you are,” the middle head sighs before you have a chance to even greet him
>He drops a pair of tickets down from his sky-scraping desk
>”Thanks again, pops,” the wolfess says with as much of a salute as she can with the luggage in tow. “We’ll be back in a week or two.”
>”Very well,” the cerberus responds
>As you turn to leave, his booming voice stops you
>”Mr. Anon, a word with you, if I may? Alone?”
>Volfa shoots him a look, as if daring him to try anything funny
>When she’s gone the cerberus puts all his work aside and stands up, giving you a good look at just how colossal he is
>”I’m sure you’ve been given your share of threats from everyone here since your arrival about what will happen to you should any harm come to her.”
>He’s not wrong; that cheery spore mother in Gulchgut got pretty terrifying
>”So I will spare you my own lecture. Instead, I have a request.”
>You expected him to be angry or menacing as he looms over you
>Not somber and soft-spoken
>”Please, take care of my Volfa. I know I haven’t always been there for her, haven’t always been the best father. But, she’s all I have left in this life. I can’t lose her as well. Please, Anon.”
>You didn’t give his desk much attention last time, but now you notice a much larger version of the picture that hangs in Volfa’s room
>A three-headed canine and a human woman, love in their faces
>You nod to the cerberus
>You promise to let nothing bad happen to her
>”Thank you for understanding.”
>He turns to stare at the wall
>”You may go. Have a safe trip.”
>The middle head keeps looking directly forward while the flanking two each pull out handkerchiefs, dabbing their eyes and noses
>When you return to Volfa she gives you a suspicious look
>”He better not have been too hard on you.”
>You just shake your head
 
>Through the station and into the sedan that brought you to the monsters’ home you go
>The driver is trying to hide his exposed muscle tissue with the mask of a saggy old man
>”Tickets, please.”
>The ride doesn’t feel nearly as long now that you’re not anxiously waiting to see your love again
>And yet, you almost wish the ride would be longer so you can continue spending such a peaceful moment with Volfa
>Her energy and willingness to have a good time are legendary, but even in complete silence you can feel her force of presence
>In the rear-view mirror you see some life in the driver’s face as he cracks a smile at the happy couple
>You look from him to the glamour of Volfa’s jeweled choker: you’re not sitting beside a wolfess, but a dark-haired human
>She’s no doubt a beautiful figure, one that is so similar to her mother’s that it’s no wonder her father fell in love with a human
>But all the while you see the illusion it just makes you more determined to always look at Volfa with your own two eyes
>No doubt a deliberate flaw in the glamour’s design from that sly apothecary to keep lovers’ gaze on the one who matters most
>Good move, Medafet
 
>You arrive back at your hometown in the evening
>Things look too boring already compared to the monster world
>Volfa easily reads your demeanor
>”Come on, I was just messing with you before. I’m sure it’ll be a good time!”
>You hadn’t even given much thought into who to visit or where you’ll even be staying
>Some friends and family would likely take you in, but there’s still something holding you back from introducing your wolfess girlfriend of one week to them
>”Well, if you’re giving up already, I think I have a place in mind,” Volfa says
>Sure enough, there’s a place hidden in the city that only someone like Volfa could find
>And much like the secret catacombs you were spirited away to over a month ago, the buildings around you seem to shift to give access only to those who need it
>There’s a stonework concierge inside for the single room he guards, though you wouldn’t be surprised by now if that room is some kind of weird extra-dimensional space
>”We can stay with your family sometime, don’t worry,” the wolfess says as she tosses the luggage inside, “but here’s our little getaway when we need some extra...privacy.”
>Well, it’s definitely cozy
>One bed, a few tables and assorted furniture, a bathroom, and a small hearth for warmth
>She reaches into a dresser and tosses you something
>It’s a stack of bills
>Holy...
>That’s a lot of money
>”Nobody beats us when it comes to Halloween. Nobody. We make bank off you guys every year from costumes and party stuff, and it’s enough to spread around to anyone who needs it when they come to visit.”
>So, how many other monsters are even allowed to freely walk around when it’s not Halloween?
>”Not many, so don’t blow this for us.”
>Volfa grabs the stack and playfully slaps you in the face with it
>”You saw how uptight the old man was about me coming here. Now, imagine if you don’t have a magical disguise choker, or good ol’ nepotism to help you out. At most you’re leasing a closet space in some small child’s bedroom.”
>She flips through the wad of bills with her claw
>”Not saying we should be wasting all this on ourselves, but I’d like to see the best of what you think the humans have to offer, you know?”
>She tucks the money into your crimson jacket and gives it a little pat
>”Just remember, when we’re back at ‘home’ home, you won’t need any of this. I’ve got everything I need over there to take care of you, Little Red.”
>You have the freedom to do practically anything
>Though despite what Volfa said about seeing “the best” of the human world, you get the feeling she just wants to do what you enjoy most
>Whatever makes you happy
>”Remember, I’m ‘Vee’ when we’re here,” she says with a nudge
>Right, “V for Volfa”?
>”Hey, I didn’t come up with it myself. My old man thought it would work if he ever had to bring me here with him.”
>Wait, the cerberus expected to bring her here himself?
>Volfa is mum on the subject
 
>You take Volfa to your favorite hangouts and restaurants
>You go to typical dating spots like theaters, museums, make-out spots...
>For only being allowed to visit the human world once per year, she already knows how most things seem to work
>It’s not really showing someone around who has never seen “civilization” before, but rather showing someone around when they’ve only seen the place at night
>At first you’re on edge just walking around in public with her
>Nobody else can see her the same way as you do, but it takes some adjustment time to have a large anthropomorphic wolf walking with you down the street
>Like being naked on the “safe” side of a one-way mirror
>Every so often you’ll be in the city when Volfa and a random stranger make eye contact
>The two exchange nods, then go about their ways
>Friend of hers?
>”Heh, no idea who he is, but you should know better than anyone what comradery us monsters have.”
>She might be selling humans a little short, because your family accepts Volfa immediately
>Though she might just have some kind of power over people like that
>Still, she isn’t spared the same kind of, “Don’t do anything to hurt him,” warning you’ve gotten several times already from her own people
>She takes it in stride, making sure to give them plenty of cues as to just how much she loves you
>The only thing she holds back is your nickname
>Medafet made a good observation: she really doesn’t ever use it except when she’s alone with you
>You’re met with no resistance when you try explaining to your folks you’ll probably be living with “Vee” most of the time, but you’ll come home to visit everyone occasionally
>Speaking of which, your friends are awestruck by Volfa
>”Where did you even find someone like her?” they say
>When you’re feeling snarky, you tell them the complete truth:
>She met YOU when the rest of the group abandoned you for some crappy Freak Fair ride
>The guilt of their past deed doesn’t outweigh their jealousy
 >Of course Volfa is the instigator type, rubbing it in with her public displays of affection
>”I really got the best one to be my Little Red,” she says to you in private
 
>You’re really looking forward to New Year’s Eve
>You’ve already bounced between worlds a few times, but you persuaded her to stay on the human side at least for the end of the year
>Knowing how much Volfa loves to party (and drink), you bet it’s going to be her second favorite holiday by far
>So it’s a bit of a shocker when she’s completely disinterested in going out for the celebration
>”You know, there’s something we really don’t do often enough, and I’d like to make up for lost time.”
>The two of you are back at the hideaway with a cozy fire going
>At first you think she’s just being sensual and getting in the mood
>That can’t possibly be what she was talking about given how blunt she is about her sex
>And how hard you rock the bed most nights
>”Come over here, big guy,” she says, sitting up against the couch
>Not even ON the couch, but right on the floor in front of it
>She pats the empty spot beside her and you take a seat
>Once settled she wraps an arm around your shoulder and pulls you in snugly
>You expect something big to happen, but it never does
>You’re soon wishing nothing ever does
>She leans her head against yours, stroking the back of your neck and massaging your scalp with her gentle paw
>You pay her back, running your fingers through her dark, smooth pelt
>Your free hand interlocks with hers
>There’s no urgency, no worries, no deadlines to dread
>Just watching the flickering hearth in your shared room, removed from the rest of the world for a moment
>She eventually leans into you too much, and you end up on your side with her pressed up behind you
>Her arm is draped over your body, and her legs over yours
>Your head is resting in the crook of her neck; its plush fur billowing over you just enough so you can savor her earthly aroma
>Your front is warmed by the fire while everything else is covered by your wolfess
>Her paw rubs your chest in slow circles
>You can hear the occasional thumping of her tail on the floor, when you’re not completely absorbed in the flow of her deep breathing
>Breathing that soothes you with a tranquilizing rhythm
>Your only wish in this moment is to see her face as she protects you with such a caring embrace
>Her chest heaves into your back before she lets out a drawn-out sigh
>”I don’t think I have the energy to make it to the bed tonight,” she chuckles
>Neither do you
>The fire stays with you until you can’t keep your eyes open any longer, then it excuses itself little by little
>”Love you...” Volfa whispers before drifting off to sleep
>It’s amazing how the floor can feel better than any mattress, as long as you’re in the arms of the one you love most
 
>October 31st
>Your one-year anniversary with Volfa
>The whole gang is back together at Freak Fair, with the addition of the wolfess
>This time, SHE’s in the red cloak while you’re wearing the nightgown and a cheesy wolfman mask
>The guys make sure to keep close to you, thinking your good fortune from last year is going to rub off on them
>Unlike last year, you’re in the FRONT of the line for the same ride you first met Volfa on, Turmoil of Loathe
>You’re not a single rider anymore, either
>When the ride’s over the two of you have a head start before the guys get off to escape for the “real” entertainment
>”Are you sure you don’t want them to come along?” the wolfess says
>You’ve thought about it; you’re sure a few of them would love the monster world
>But some selfish part of you wants to keep it a secret, if only for a little while longer
>”Yeah, I don’t blame you,” she says. “Remember how little I trusted you at first?”
>Like you’d forget ANY part of that night
>”I hope you saved my little memento from the next morning!”
>Even the dark, twisting road to the catacombs somehow feels the same
>Before you know it, you’re tossing aside your costume in the catacomb foyer
>Volfa hands you her cloak
>Your cloak
>”You know the drill, Little Red,” she winks. “It stays on until I rip it off!”
>The place is the same is how you remember it, only this time the monsters are more accustomed to the sight of you
>You run the gauntlet of festivities first, at Volfa’s request
>The two of you are shaking things up a bit by doing everything backwards
>When you take a breather, you’re back at the bar just leaning on the counter and slamming some pretty hair-raising drinks
>Everyone else is genuinely having a good time as well, and not standing around like they’re just here to be decoration
>”This is so much better,” Volfa sighs. “I feel like a real dumb pup for trying to force things back at the mausoleum....”
>You rub her back, and she does the same for you
>You spot a few human girls mixed in with the crowd, dreamy smiles and blissfully unaware of what exactly they got themselves into
>”Poor things probably won’t have a single memory of this tomorrow.”
>Volfa does a click with her tongue
>”You might have to consider bringing your friends next year. Getting kind of tired of seeing only the dude monsters have fun with the humans.”
>Looking back at ditching your friends, you hope they can still have a good night on their own
>Everyone deserves to have their own Volfa
>You’re pulled under her arm affectionately
>”Not like I should be sweating stuff like that. After all, my old man met the love of his life at a party just like this.”
>A human woman, stolen away for a night of merriment, likely having no idea she’d be the mother of a snarky wolf child
>”It was him who pushed so hard to organize this one night of freedom for everyone, even getting a shitty desk job just to keep our two worlds connected.”
>Guess it wouldn’t be completely the same with Volfa if she didn’t have a moment of reflection like this
>”And I was kind of a brat to him all those years, breaking the rules all the time and almost ruining things for everyone....”
>The sooner she gets it off her chest, the sooner you can get back to the revelry
>You give her a kiss on the muzzle, and you get a lick in return
>”This is why you’re my wingman!” she laughs. “You keep me looking at the best of things!”
>She stares at you with those golden eyes
>First with a dopy grin, then a more seductive one
>”Always the best things...” she hums
>You go back to people watching for a while, until Volfa clears her throat
>”Speaking of family....”
>You wait for the rest, but she just pauses
>Every so often her mouth opens to find the words
>Then she balks and goes silent for a while longer
>”Hey,” she finally says, “wanna go upstairs for a bit? Managed to get the same room and everything! We can come back to all this later, if you want.”
>Volfa reaches for two empty glasses and a bottle of wine before leading you to the higher levels
>Up to the apartments protected from the humans milling about on the streets below
>A beautiful sight of the city flooding you with nostalgia as you look out the sloped window
>In a room that seems completely untouched since last year
>All that’s different is a wooden box sitting on the table
>Lid open, with two vials on full display
>One red, like your lucky cloak
>One gold, like her mesmerizing gaze
>”I know I’ve talked about it before,” she says, “but I thought maybe I’d plant the idea in your head again.”
>She takes your silence as encouragement to continue
>”We might be an inseparable, wild pair, but someday we’re going to want to settle down for a bit, right? I think my old man was on to something in that regard.”
>She pops the cork, and it sails across the moonlit window
>”Gotta get some new goals when you think you have everything you want, ya know? What I want now is to see what kind of little bastards we can make together.”
>As she pours the wine, you think you can see the liquid in the vials twinkling in the corner of your eye
>”And if we want some alone time, I’m sure we can get someone to watch the pups. Obviously there’s my old man, but recently I heard there’s also a sweet little apothecary back home who knows how to handle troublesome wolf pups.”
>Well, if Medafet indeed taught Volfa what she knows about messing with people, “troublesome” would be softballing it
>”But, this is all for when you’re ready, Little Red. I’m not the type of girl who just rushes you into things, am I?”
>There’s that impish tongue of hers sticking out at you
>Volfa hands you your glass, then hooks your arm with hers
>There’s no doubt she’s going to have you under the sheets before midnight, but you’re content just staring into her eyes until that time comes
>”Happy Halloween, Anon.”



>The end
