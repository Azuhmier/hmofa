Heylop, here to dump another maybe unique Anthro story on this board. Also this a compensation for "Thirsty for Love".

>Be Soviet Anon, with hunger from Ukrainian SSR state
>Yfw your too smart for common people
>So the leader in your home town said "Screw it, put him in Chernobyl, what could he possibly see something wrong there?"
>Turns out everything is wrong over there and you find yourself in a advanced hazmat suit and a book on how to calm a reactor
>"Anon, when will I see sisters?"
>Speaking of which
"I'm sorry Fae, but you still can't see your sisters today, you know when was the last time"
>The last time was someone turned the power off and almost 'Killed' the reactior n.1
>But Fae doesn't seem to notice or care enough at least
>You then started packing your bags and research notes, but Fae starrleyd you a bit by placing her hand on the book and said
>"Anon, when will you stay with me?"
>Ah, the everyday question
"Maybe, tomorrow. Or after lunch yes"
>She "smiled" and you mirror the latter as her happiness is infectious as her body
>Which is highly radiated with substances that will make those American pigs eat their own shit
>American spies are everywhere and you recently heard the news of Westerners spreading their propaganda on the Soviet people and all the workers
>"And hey Anon!"
>You stopped mid opening sealed door and turned around to see a "blushing" Reactor
>She was involuntarily opening her "mouth" before saying
>"I-I'm sorry for wasting time, but. Goodbye Anon, see you in a next hour"
>Her voice seemed to shrivel but you were too dense to hear it, it was partially the helmet that the suit was part of, but mostly because of your poor autism of social cues
>You closed the sealed door with a loud thump, and exited out of your suit
>With a final mechanical dink, the containment has finally been closed
>But a thought stopped 
>You promised to see her, and you'll fulfill that unsaid promise
>Even if it's the last time you'll ever meet a "girl" like her



Loneliness
>Be Fae, but sadly refer mostly as Reactor 4
>By those insult of a people
>Particularly you don't naturally have an intense hatred to humanity as whole but when it comes to this particular society
>This Soviet Union
>Oh Great being spare me the 'talk'
>Anyway as Anon left the chamber that is your "Container" you always radiate power in order for the human city to be powered so it wouldn't be dark every night and power the "People's" utilities
>Beside all these the most that hurt you the most was your sisters being contained
>That day was the most hurtful and bitter filled anger that you have become
>But besides all that hostility and hatred, there was this only human that you tolerate the most
>His name was Anon
>He was, say excelled at understanding you during the early days
>Most of the times you would've killed him on the spot that he stood but incidentally you gave him a chance to explain
>And he deeply knew about it
>Or did he
>You mean that how can he quickly understand about you without seeing your first?
>Has he "interviewed" your sisters before going to you?
>Does he do deeds that disgusts you
>Or was he just another peasant from the outside
>Doubt, feeling it and it's not only distressing but also painful
>on your chest, the middle of it
>Something so familiar yet very soothing that makes you care for him and allowed him to gently swoon his small fingers on your log sized hands
>Very familiar, but can't point it out
>You longed for your sisters to approach you and cheer
>You wanted your mother nature to take a neutrality on your head and connect with the "world"
>You need to live so you can see the aftermath of this; society
>And all of it, boils down to...him?
>But why?
>Not even a ancient being knows an answer to every question
>And with that thought, you think of yourself as...
>Lonely
>Despite your sister's telling that you are not, it only made you worse
>You needed freedom but Anon, Where will he go without you?
"Please Someone"

Weird
>Be Soviet "scientist" Anon
>Right now is April 25 1986 as per documented
>One more day before you relocate to more same paying job near Volgograd
>Perfectly a place to move to, you heard good vodka there
>But first personal business
>Byes to relatives and family. And sorrowfully a message to Fae
>Oh god why
>"Anon, are you alright?"
>Fae's voice interrupted your thinking and replied an apology
"I'm sorry, so so sorry Fae I-"
>"What are you talking about Anon"
>Blinking, you sheepishly scratches your left arm, even thought you can't feel the nails digging in your skin you still can feel the force
"Just something in my Mind Fae, nothing to worry about"
>her face seemed passive but you can tell that she suspects something
>So, as blunt as she is she questioned it, openly
>"What do you mean by "About" Anon?"
>Now you've muled yourself
>This is like a point of no return now
"It means that I'm going to take a break for several days Fae"
>Not good at keeping a straight face, you managed but Fae still presses on
>"What Do you mean?!"
>As much as she looks cool and calculated from the outside, but in the inside she is impulsively brighter than the sun
>You can even feel radiation trying to penetrate your suit like tiny blood-sucking bats
>"Am I not worth keeping?"
>The comment made you speechless, as she barrages more and more of what you can consider as nonsense
>"Am I Just a tool to be used?!"
>"What do you view ME Anon!"
>"A-aA Tool or a friend!"
>Am I a just a pocket to be used-"
"YOUR NOT!"
>Ouch your throat. But it's the only way for her to stop approaching you
"You're not a tool that I talked into helping me, your not a thing to be just thrown away once you usefulness is over, You are my best friend and I will always, Always loved you no matter what happens when I'm out of this country"
>Ow, your feels
>"If *sniff*, that's what you wish"
>She dropped on the ground and continued to "cry"
>The sob weathered her happiness. cynicism dripping from her hair
