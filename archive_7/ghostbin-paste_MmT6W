>be anon
>going through a rough time
>maned wolf gf since high school hit it big with her music career and got her chance to tour the world.
>you wanted to settle down close to where you were, so you decided to split things off amicably
>didn't make things hurt any less though
>you've been in your house for 3 weeks and still haven't gotten over it
>your friends are worried about you
>finally decide to get a cup of coffee outside just to change up your surroundings
>walk into the store
>you forget this was the store that you and her always went to together
>damn it
>you overhear some loud obnoxious whispering but turn around to see a flash of tan fur entering the bathroom
>you shrug and don't think much more of it
>you order your coffee and sit down, planning to leave the second you finish your last sip
>before you can get up, a tall figure asks:
"Is this seat taken?"
>standing across from you is this 8 1/2 feet tall beanpole of a woman with tan fur and ears like radar dishes
>she wore a trenchcoat that covered at least 6 of those 8 feet and had to be hemmed down significantly at the arms.
>now you were no stranger to strange proportions especially considering your last partner, but something about this seemed off
>but this was the most attention you've gotten from a girl in a while, and so you shrug your shoulders and motion towards the chair facing you.
>the fennec woman immediately takes her seat, barely bending her legs to sit down
>was this woman all torso?
"I know it seems kinda sudden, but you just seemed down, so I figured I'd give you company."
>even past her thick set of glasses, her sympathy looked genuine, so you decide to entertain her
"Just trying to get outside more, I've been inside most of the month."
"I know what you mean, weather outside has been awful!"
>you notice a bit of fidgeting in her torso for second
>something about this foxes' face looks familiar
>there was a barista who worked here who wore pretty similar glasses, what was her name, Maria?
"Everytime I want to go for a walk, we're hit with 6 inches of snow, you can't win."
"It's not really about the weather actually."
>she looks at you, waiting on you to elaborate.
"Broke off a long term thing, my girl wanted to be a rockstar and I didn't want to be the one to hold her back."
>she reaches over the table to console you, having to bend a significant distance to place a hand on your shoulder.
"I'm really sorry to hear, dude. Long term stuff has to hurt the most."
>you hear a muffled swear word come the coat, and the woman quickly readjusts herself to sit straight up.
>what the hell is going on?
>was there someone else underneath the coat?
>she must have caught you looking at her strangely because she backpedals.
"Sorry, it's a medical thing, I can't bend my spine for too long."
"Mm hm."
>her ears fold back and she tries desperately to control the flow of conversation once again
"So, uh, I never really got your name?"
"Anon, and you?"
"My name is M-"
>you see her ears stand up as she yelps in pain
>she pulls the collar forward to speak into the coat
"Sarah, really? Right now?"
>clearly there was someone else underneath the coat, which would explain the arms and legs
>but clearly they were committed enough to the act to introduce themselves like this, and you didn't want to spoil the fun.
>in fact, you were going to add to the chaos
"Sarah? What a nice name. You know, there's a server who works here who looks just like you, same glasses and all."
>the foxes' ears stand on end as she struggles to respond
"Oh! I've uh... never met her before in my life! Hah! This is my first time around here!"
"I think her name was Maria, cute, but a nervous wreck. Might've asked her out if I wasn't already committed."
>'Sarah' starts to blush
>the person under her coughs several times, muttering the name "Myriam"
"Do you really think I'm cute? I mean, I know you're not talking about me just someone who lookslikemeand-"
>you see her flinch again, then pull back her collar once more
"Knock it off, he's going to find out!"
"Find out what?"
>the fox freezes up completely
>then she takes an approach you weren't expecting
"Find out that I think you're really cute too, haha!"
>you smirk
"You don't say?"
>she can't even look you in the eye, and she seems kind of desperate to save herself the embarassment
>you could cut her losses, but you decide to grant a victory to the poor girl and her partner.
"I have some errands I need to attend to, so how about I give you my number, then? 
	Not many people have the gall to admit something like that right away, and I'd like to know you better."
>she doesn't say a word as you write your number on your receipt and hand it to her.
"I'm free on Sundays."
>you can see 'her' tail wagging behind her, as well as rapid movement a couple feet above it
>looks like you made both of their days
"Th-Thanks! I'll call when I can!"
>the team pushes itself out of the chair and walks away
>you can see 'Sarah' pumping her fist
>you call out to her when she takes her first step out the door
"I'll see you around, Sarah!"
>fast forward a week
>things haven't been so hot for you, especially with your boss riding your ass so hard
>it feels like you can never get ahead of your reports
>not to mention the sad feeling you get whenever you thought about Laney, your rockstar ex
>you know you have to put the pictures of her on your desk away, but you find it's much easier said than done
>both your watch and favorite tie were gifts from her, and she left posters and other stuff behind in your room when she finally moved out
>sometimes you wonder to yourself whether or not it could have worked out over long distance, but thinking about it for too long only makes you sad
>on your break you decide to step out to clear your head
>two of your coworkers had gotten into a scuffle over a sabotaged powerpoint and frankly you just didn't want to deal with this bullshit today
>you find the coffee shop, remembering that weird incident from before
>asking to sit on top of your friend's shoulder
>what a strange length to go to impress a crush
>you stop to think about it for a second
>you used to come here with Laney all the time, so maybe she thought you had a thing for tall chicks?
>why not just use stilts?
>not that it mattered, you liked women of all sizes
>except fat chicks
>you shake yourself out of it and head to the line, solving a sudoku puzzle on your phone as you wait for things to thin out.
>ahead of you, you catch a glimpse of the barista, a short fennec fox wearing a black company apron, as well as a patterned dress and headscarf
>as she finishes up with her last order, you slide over and rest your arm on the counter.
"I'll help you in a min-"
>she freezes when she recognizes you
>you glance at her nametag, which reads "Myriam"
>so it was her!
>and you know exactly what you want to do with that information
>first things first, though, you need to take care of your order
"Can I get a medium coffee, milk and two sugars?"
>flustered, the fox draws a cup from the stack and immediately starts the tap
>after stirring in the milk and sugar and placing the cover over the drink, she slides it over to you.
"Uh... that's gonna be $1.65, sir."
>you hand her your card
"I'll pay in debit. Your name is Myriam, right?"
"Right!"
>she nods in affirmation
"I don't know if this sounds racist or anything but do you know a 'Sarah' by any chance? Extremely tall for a fennec. I was talking to her here the other day."
>Her cheeks flush underneath her fur
"I um... I might know somebody like that, I can pass along a message."
"Good. I just thought she seemed kinda nervous when we talked and she didn't end up texting me back. I was kinda disappointed, if I'm being honest."
"Oh! I didn't- I mean, I heard from her that she was really shy about making the first move, andalsothatImighthaveaccidentlythrewoutyournumber."
>she had to be the same girl, no doubt
>well, if you had to make the first move...
"How about you give me her number, then? That way we can set up some kind of real date."
"Goodness! I-I suppose she wouldn't mind if I passed it to you."
