###WORK IN PROGRESS!!!!!!!
This code repository aims to allow one to quickly analyze and categorize their online
storybins that are in a txt format. It also has "scraping" scripts that are yet to be
integrated, but will allow one to check for dead links and changes in the txt files
themselves. Of course, such scripts must be used only on websites that permit it.
